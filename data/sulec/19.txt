I am not totally in favor of not smoking in public places, but I think that there should be places for smoking and no smoking. For example in a restaurant there should be a section for no smoking people and another section, apart from that, for smoking people. In the case of the aeroplanes, I think it is right no to be allowed to smoke; but in the airport we have to have a section for the smokers, because we have to understand that after a trip of X hours, the anxiety is bigger and they want to smoke, so in that place they could satisfy themselves and people who does not like the smel of cigarretes could not necesarilly pass through that smoking area. In the case of banks or administration offices, I am in favour of no smoking because, it would not be able to divide them in areas, and it would be problematic. In any case a normal person goes to the bank for some specific reason and would not spend too much time, and then he could smoke. For the employers, well, I am in favour of not smoking in working hours, they could maybe smoke in their lunch-time, and when you get a job you know if you could or could not smoke, so you already know with what you are dealing. In open spaces like parks, everyone should be able to smoke because, it is a different atmosphere. In conclusion, I think that there are places where should be completely forbidden, and others where there should be smoking and no smoking areas.
The aim of this composition is related to the marriage of persons of the same sex. Marriage is not only forever (as the Church says) but also it is accompanied by some rights. From my point of view, if people who love each other can choose marrying or not, why cannot homosexual people do the same? Marriage is, in my opinion, a question of love: I love somebody, I want to marry him and there is no problem because the society and all the institutions allow me to marry. Well, I love a woman, I want to marry her. Stop! Because some people could say that we are indecent, a priest will never marry us and other things like these. Am I guilty of loving a woman? Marriage, a difficult decision but it's more difficult if society doesn't give you the opportunity of doing although marriage is the thing that you desire. I think that homosexual people should have the same rights as heterosexual people because all people are human-beings according to God.
This is a very important topic that people should take into account because tobacco is bad for public health. In my opinion smoking in public places should be illegal, because for non-smoking people this could be a problem, because non-smoking people usually are pasive smokers. The smoke is bad for children and even for ill people. Tobacco is bad for smoker people and for those who are near them. In some places smoking is illegal like in hospitals, but I think that is better to make it illegal in every where. If you want to smoke, do it in your house, because in your house you don't disturb other people. Nowadays, is very common to find somebody smoking in a bank, in the bus, in a bar, etc, but if you ask to a non-smoking person this situation could affect them. I don't smoke and I don't care if people smoke in public places if they don't disturb me with the smoke, because some people who smoke are unpolite and put the cigarrete near you or throw the smoke in your face, etc, other people are polite and don't disturb, but in general ways I think that is better to make it illegal, if you want to smoke do it in your house. I understand that smoke is an adition and some people need to smoke when they feel stress or depress or anxious but another people need to relax without supporting the smoke of a cigarrete.
