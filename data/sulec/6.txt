A student who has finished his studies at university is not always prepared to work. At universities the majority of lectures are magistrals, there are not practical classes. The proffessional diplomas are practical but they are undervalued, most of students want to take a university degree. It is believed by the majority of university students that practical lectures are hardest than magistral lectures, they prefer to do a major effort at the end of the year, not the whole year. In addition to this, university teachers prefer magistral lectures because they have not to prepare classes before. The majority of university teachers are old and they are tired of teaching. Moreover the majority of university degrees are totaly theorical:filologies, policies, law studies... and they are supported by old studies plans without practice. In addition there is another problem: mediums for practice are very limited. Against this it could be argued that not all of university degrees are theorical. A lot of them have practical lectures, for exemple: nursery studies, gymnastic studies, ...At this faculties teachers teach practice and they dispose of practical mediums. In conclusion, after I have explained the most importants points of view about this topic I want to ask myself something: “Can we change our university studies system?”. The answer is in our hands.
Actually most university degrees do not prepare students for the real world, because they are theoretical. For that reason students are in a difficult situation. In the real world all is practise and they are not prepared for that. We must search the best solution to them. Nowadays university students are not prepared for the real world. In fact they had studied more theory than practise. However in the laboral work practise is more important than theory. On the other hand we must say that there is not practise without theory and also that theory has to be linked to practise. They have the same importance. In addition to this we have to say that some teachers only teach theory and they have not interest in practise. They argued that theory is the more important base. Therefore, because of what I’ve said in the body of my essay that’s what I think about university degrees: I think education system has to change. It’s necessary to prepare students in a best way in order to facilitate their laboral future.
First of all, we should make a distinction between outdoors places, this is places exposed to open air, and indoors places, where the air can not circulate loosely. I think that the impact of smoke(from tobacco) on the lungs of passive smokers is higher on a closed or indoors place than on an open or outdoors one because the air can not circulate and be renewed in the same way in both places. Regarding the outdoors places, we realize that there is full air circulation and renewing so the only problem we can find will be the smell of the tobacco smoke. This trouble can be avoided establishing two separated zones: one for smokers and the other for non-smokers with a slight separation but in the same place. In the case of indooors places, we find that air circulation is poor and even a good system of air-conditioning can not provide a renewed air as if we were outdoors. Taking this into account, we should try to avoid the contact between smokers and non-smokers creating a zone for each one of them. Those zones should be fully separated; this is, each one should be a room with total independence rom the other one. They should be considered as different places regarding their degree of separation and, this way it should be impossible that a smoker one could be affected in any way by the pollution of tobacco smokers. To sum up, I think that it is very difficult to find a public indoors place that could be divided in two to allow the creation of smoking roooms or even duplicating its services, for example: Can you imagine two different queues, one for smokers and the other for non-smokers, at the entrance of the INEM? So my conclusion is clear; it should be legal smoking in outdoors public places because with a few organization and respect there should not be any trouble, but regarding indoors public places, I think that smoking should be illegal because any health damage should be avoided, even the smallest possibility, and also the option of dividing the public places is very expensive and almost impossible.
