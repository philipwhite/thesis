The marriage of persons of the same sex should be allowed. It's unfair because as human beings all of us have the same rights. First of all, some people don't accept it but it must not be important because maybe homosexuals do not accept marriage between heterosexuals. I think it is unfair because everybody in the same country should have the same opportunities. They are also people that want make a family. Too many people is probably worried about the future, about a world ful of homosexuals, but the point is that a wide range of important and brilliant authors have been known as homosexuals through decades, as Federico Garcia Lorca or Oscar Wilde. If people do not care of that and think about the brilliant careers of these men, why do not people think of the personal qualities of every person? Some people treat homosexuality as an illness. Why is not discrimination an illness or pathology? Government treat it as a problem, but is not, it is a fact. Then, goverment should think more deeply of other real problems. That marriage is only something that has to be done and some citizens will need time to approve it.
The Government shouldn't ban in public places because people who don't smoke enjoy of some free places of tobacco but what happens with people who smoke? I agree that we must preserve places where people can't smoke for no-smokers because they have their rights to not breathe the polluted air. However, smokers have their right too to smoke in any part but at least in a specific place. The new law doesn't allow to smoke in pubs, clubs, etc. and this is one of the places where people more have cigarettes so it will be a problem for the owners and for the customers. Moreover, it is a contradiction that the Government bans are of its big incomes; in one hand the Government is absolutely against the consume of tobacco because is worse for the health, everybody agrees, but in the other hand is one of the bigger incomes of it and everyday we can find cheaper brands of tobacco, which is helpful for young people; this is what the Government must control, don't make young consumers, that is my point of view the key of the problem.
WHAT'S MARRIAGE? IS IT JUST A MATTER OF RELIGION, OR A MATTER OF CIVIL RIGHTS? BOTH OPTIONS ARE VALID, BECAUSE ANYONE CAN GET MARRIED BECAUSE OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, OR WITH THE AIM OF GETTING SOME CIVIL RIGHTS. WHEN PERSONS OF THE SAME SEX ARE ATTEMPTING TO GET MARRIED, THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE REASONS EXPLAINED ABOVE. BUT JUST WHEN PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR REFUSAL TO HOMOSEXUAL MARRIAGES, THEY ARE SEPARATING THIS COLECTIVE FROM THE REST OF SOCIETY, ALIENATING AND SEGREGATING THEM. ON ONE HAND, I THINK THIS ATTITUDE IS NOT FAIR BECAUSE ONE'S SEXUAL TENDENCY IS NOT DETERMINED BY RELIGIONS, SO YOU MAY BE GAY AND, AT THE SAME TIME, HAVE A STRONG BELIEF IN YOUR GOD. ON THE OTHER HAND, MARRIAGE IS SUPPOSED TO BE BASED ON LOVE, AND THIS CONCEPT OF LOVE HAS BEEN ALTERED THROUGH HISTORY BY RELIGIONS AND OTHER SOCIAL FACTORS. IN MY OPINION, WHEN YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE, THAT "SOMEONE" SHOULD BE A PERSON, AND NOT A SPECIFIC GENDER. I MEAN, YOU MAY LIKE A PERSON, INDEPENDENTLY OF HIS OR HER SEX; I DON'T SEE THE POINT IN LIMITING OURSELVES IN ADVANCE. BESIDES, OUR THOUGHTS SHOULD REFLECT THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE TODAY, INSTEAD OF THINKING ABOUT LOVE AS A MATTER OF REPRODUCTION.
