Nowadays it is forbidden to smoke in many public places. Every smoker has to try to respect this but I know that it is quite difficult for them. I am a non-smoker but as I could perceive in my surroundings it is quite difficult for smokers to give up this habit. On the one hand smoke should be forbidden in public places because the smoke affects everyone. I can’t stand staying in a pub if there is no air-conditioning. When I go out I find myself with many difficulties to breathe. This is one of the reasons why I think it should be forbidden. However, I know that if we passed this new law it would bring many problems to our society, specially economic problems and many factories would go bankrupt. A good idea would be to have different areas for smokers and non-smokers though we know that if we did that in every place it would seem like we were different species. In the train you could see this example. Sometimes being a non-smoker you have to try to sacrifice yourself in order to stay with your friends. If I think that it would not be a bad thing to prohibit smoking it’s because in some countries like Ireland this is a fact and it is giving very positive results. Also in Madrid there are many pubs in which is not allowed and in spite of this many people go to these places. This would be a way to make the people conscious that smoking is a very destructive vice and that we have to try to smoke less if we want to improve our lives. We have to try to make them face that they can be independent from this vice and that they can have a good time without smoking. Doing this we would also have in our society less young smokers.
The prohibition of smoking in all public places is a good idea from the point of view of medicine, although most people reject this thought. It is clear that people who earn money with tobbacco will dislike this idea, because if people can not smoke in almost no place, they will leave tobbacco aside. This, of course, will suppose a great loss of money and of tobbacco itself. This change would not be immediately, but little by little. People who have starded smoking many years ago, probably would continue smoking in streets and in their houses, but it is true that the new generations of teenagers will not start smoking and it is a good point, at least, so as to improve our health. I’m sure that smokers do not like at all this idea although they know that it is a possible solution to a problem that affets people from all over the world. I think that it is a good idea but it should take place in the course of several years, not suddenly. At the same time, I think that if finally they do not forbide us to smoke in all public places, there should be some places free of smoke.
The notion of love is the main base in the union of persons for the rest of their lives. Other factors like economic, political, etc. can have importance but never the same as the love. If the love is the main factor, why people of the same sex cannot join their lives if it is that they want? In religious terms we should respect the fact that catholicism doesn’t allow this kind of marriage, but they must also know that gay people don’t want to marriage themselves under the catholic rith but also under the civil one that gives them the same rights and obligations as the heterosexual marriages. But I also think that gay people should know where should they have the limit of their rights, I’m referring to the adoption of childrens by gay couples: I think that all the people have the right of be father or mother, but also the childrens that doesn’t have the enough sense to think by themselves should have the right of that someone thinks by them and give the opinion that a children doesn’t grow in the same way being son of a heterosexual couple as a homosexual couple. In my opinion the society should wait before allow this kind of adoptions because we don’t know how a boy or a girl is going to grow in a atmosphere so different as the actual ones. I’m not saying that two men or two women are not capable of educate a boy in a good way but I’m not sure if all the society is going to accept it. I’m talking, for example, of the jokes and mocks that a boy can suffer in his school by the simply fact of having two fathers, we know how cruel children can be, and the person that is going to suffer more allways is the boy. Is only a small example but we don’t know also if a couple of fathers or mothers is going to educate a boy even better than an heterosexual couple, that also can happen. Is for that, for the fact that we don’t know how this kind of adoptions are going to be that we should wait and walk slowly in this sense. But of course, if Paco loves Javier or Rosa loves Eva they should could married between themselves, and have the same rights and obligations as a conventional marriage.
