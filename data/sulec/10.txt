Why not? In my opinion, this is just a matter of education. If we had been educated in the same-gender couples society, we couldn’t have any doubt about it. And I think that as much is a society developed, much better will be the understanding in front of this marriages. In example, the Netherlands, it appears to be an opened society with opening minds; they were the first fighting for same sex marriages that got it. In Spain it will be quite difficult that society accept it because they are to closed to do it. We can see it everyday on TV or in the press, but our society is still thinking that the model they have ever seen, a pair man-woman, is the best we can have. About same-sex couples having children, I think that is also the same. I think many times what will I do if I wouldn’t have a husband and it’s better two of the same sex than one alone because boys and girls need mother and father figure in their lifes. But on the other hand, I have many friends that grew up with one of the members of the couple and they have been good persons with a normal behaviour. Another point of view is the one of the Catholic Church, I think they are not living the real life, they stopped their minds some centuries ago. They should refresh the way they think and don’t give their opinion about this kind of marriages. In sume, I am in favour with those marriages.
I think that it depends really on the situation and specially the place where it should be illegal. If we are talking about a bar or a restaurant we should take into account the three parts involved in this problem. One of them is the owner of the business. I am quite sure that the prohibition of smoking in bars in Ireland will make very angry the owners of the pubs, as they will probably lose part of the clientele. It this case it should depend on the proprietors’ decision whether to allow or not to smoke in their bar. Then we have the smoker, the person that goes to the pub to have a beer, have a little chat with friends and smoke a cigarette as a social thing. On the other side we have the non-smoker person that has to bear with a crowded room full smoke. For them it is also a matter of good manners. In some countries the solution of having different areas for smokers and non-smokers on the restaurants seems to work. Then, there are all the other public places: banks, hospitals, schools... At work it seems to be different as it is not a place you go to enjoy yourself. At least you choose whether to go to a pub or not. For some people to make such a fuss about this matter is a response of a big mediate campaign. For others it is quite the contrary, this campaign has been done to stop the increase of people that smoke. I am neither in favour nor against smoking in public places but I do sometimes wonder why should be illegal to do something that it is legal.
I think that the marriage of persons of the same sex should be allowed, first of all because we are free to decide what we want or which is the person we want to love. It is allowed in some places, here in Spain in Catalunya, and I think it’s a big step to open our minds, to understand: other points of view of living the sexual life and to know this people and respect them. It’s difficult to understand and to explain this situation, specially if I don’t know their daily life is. I am sure about one thing: they are HUMANS like you, and me, and all, and they have RIGHTS in the same way for being able to make their dreams come true and getting married as all of us. Talking about our RIGHTS, the free expression, the freedom are very important ones. And I think that our sexual option is a consequence of it. We are free to choose, and to express it. To repress our feelings or what we want to do it’s too bad, and it can bring us bad consequences. If nobody is being affected because of the decisition of homosexual persons, I don’t see the problem with leaving them getting married. I don’t know if what I think is right or wrong; who knows it? But in my very personal opinion, people has to be allowed to bet married with persons of their same sex, and everybody should understand them, and leave them to live their own life as they want.
