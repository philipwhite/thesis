I agree with this sentence: “All armies should consist entirely of proffessional soldiers: there is no value in a system of military service”. Military service can be useful if people go there in a good manner. If you impose something like this you’ve to take into account people against this. With a military service imposed the work is excessively because young people are not volunteer for this proposal. But if we have a group of people who want make a military service, their instruction will be better. If a person wants to make a military sevice this person will be prepared in a best manner than a person who is obligated. Voluntary service is better. If a person go to the military service if he wants, he will be a good soldier. Soldiers without a preparation could be an easy target in a war. If we thing of a war, we will need soldiers with a big experience. If we have a war and we send to this war soldiers without experience, we could have terrible consequences. All our soldiers could be asasinated and destroyed. If military service is something volunteer every nation can increase the number of its soldiers. Every nation’s soldiers could be amazingly good. If we have an army formed by proffessional soldiers we will have a good army. They’re going to be prepared in different aspects of the war. We could have a group for desactivating mines, other group for fighting in enemie’s positions, other group for attacking enemies in their positions, and so on. We had the war of Irak recently. In this war we could see the form of acting of the best soldiers. In this war we could see groups extremely prepared. This is a project of the soldiers. I’m talking about an american project for creating the best soldiers in the world. These soldiers receive an special preparation for combats and wars. This special project of americans have a name: “landwarrior”. With this, it looks for the best soldier with an equipment amazingly sofisticated – Guns, radars…If we have normal people in the army we cannot do this kind of projects. Normal people couldn’t do something. We need a group for looking for mines in the sea etc. For these kind of things we will need special soldiers. Professional soldiers can do all these things. Professional soldiers enjoy making all these things. But normal people can’t do this kind of things.
It is widely recognized that the education-system in Spain leaves lots to be desired, let alone English teaching system: When entering the University, students expect ot reach an almost native speaker level of English as soon as they are on their final year. But the cold hard fact is that it is not true. Lessons are boring and most people decide to leave before they finish. It is also true that lessons are very theorical; the student has not the choice to participate because they pass the time copying what the teacher is saying. Fortunately, the situation is changing and more and more teachers are getting aware about the situation. This does not mean anything. Some teachers have accepted to improve their lessons, but others could not care less about the theoretical lessons. On balance, the system would be possible to change. It all depends on the students, willing to learn and sensible teachers willing to teach.
It is quite surprising the fact that many people believe that money is one of the most important things to achieve happiness as statistics show. This kind of statement reminded me of an old song claiming that “Money is the root of an evil” and I asked my friends if they agreed with this belief. Needless to say that there was a wide range of opinions; they can be divided into two groups: those that are for the topic would integrate one of them and the other one would be formed by those people against the argument. The group of people agreeing with the idea of moneyas the root of all evil support their belief by saying that when someone looks anxiously for increasing the amount of money hidden on his or her pockets, this person has a main objective achieving a successful ending, therefore he or she would go through on the steps leading to money forgetting ethics and names. For all these people material things are like Gods and this is very badly seen in the eyes of society. On the other hand, we find the group of people disagreeing with the idea of money as source of evil. They base their opinions in the fact that money is proved to be necessary to achieve happiness and they make special emphasis in the fact that money is needed to achieve happiness but that money is not happiness. Therefore they cannot understand what is wrong in trying to achieve money to cope with the daily situations. To sum up, I would like to say that money can be seen as the source of evil or not, but in my opinion, what is the source of evil is that bad us of money.
