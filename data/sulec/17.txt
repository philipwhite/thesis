When I started to study in the university I thought that at the end I could be a person with a lot of knowledge, instead of this I feel that I didn't learnt too much in three years, and the most of the things that I know now I learnt it by myself, travelling, reading and looking for information about the subjects that I was interested. In the case of english think that is always better to have lessons because the most important it's to practise but when my friends and I went to Ireland we discovered that our level of english it wasn't so good and we weren't prepared to have a conversation with the people of the country. On the other hand have studies it's not meaning that in the future we'll have a work, at least not the job in what we are interested. Go to the University it's an opportunity that we have to value positivity and; anyway, it's better that don't have nothing, but it's not the places that I had imagined, there are a lot of theoretical lessons and the practises that we do aren't enought, and there are not always a relationship between the subjects. I don't want to left the faculty because I really enjoy study but expectatives haven't been completed. I have not choice, I mean, the best thing that I could do now it's study at university (I really like it) but if I could I would do more that one change, starting to thinking about what are the mistakes of the system, what are the things that people needs, what are that people want's and what are the things that the world (specially the laboral world) want about us.
From my point of view, the marriage of persons of the same sex should be allowed (Fortunately, it is allowed right now) because, in my opinion, to be homosexual of lesbian is not a crime, and I think that they can have the right of marriage. We live in the 21st century, not in the 8th century. This is supposed to be a progressist and laic society where we have finished with all this stupid and intolerant christian concepts of what is right and what is "against nature". I would say to those people who don't like the marriage between homosexuals: "They have committed any crime to not have the possibility and the right to marriage?" Marriages of people of the same sex are as normal as "heterosexual" marriages, and now is the time of destroy the traditional and rotten concept of marriage and family, because nobody can judge a person for his/her sexual option they can be good husbands/wifes and good parents as the other people. In short, marriages of persons of the same sex should be allowed always.
Nowadays, most of the university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. This is a very important matter, because we have to understand that many people spend between 3 and 5 years (or more) studying something that will decide his/her future; and if that degree does not prepare them for the real world, all the time, the money and the efforts of those years would be totally unuseful. So we have to think about it, and we have to see that the future of the students it is not a game. But if one degree has more theory than practise, we do not should think that it is of very little value. It is only that it is not well-defined, and we should contribute to the solution of this problem.
