The prohibition of smoking in public places is a controversial theme. The smokers and non-smokers have a great different opinion, Both of them have rights, but the problem is that these rights are totally opposite. Smokers want to smoke when they need it, and they do not think about others, their preocupation is satisfying their necessity. On the other hand, non-smoker's popinion is that they have the right of breathing in a clear atmosphere. Although smokers and non-smokers think that in certain areas or public places the tobacco should be banned, in this case they are speaking about hospitals, supermarkets etc. Smoking in public places should be illegal but, at the same time the government should give sanctions for smokers such as programmes for give up tobacco, or restricted areas for smoking. It's important to know that smokers suffer a type of adiction and in some moments they need a cigarette and they cannot control themselves. So they need help or other options not only a prohibition. On the other hand, a good solution could be that the government make a prohibition about tobacco, they should banned to sell cigarettes. But goverment do not want this solution because they would lose the money of taxes in this way. It's a bit ironic that the government think about the possibility of making illegal to smoke in public places. Government should start taking into account about small thing such as, the prohibition of advertissment in walls or in different types of magazines, goverment also allow that the industry of tobacco writing smoking can kill but govermnent do not do nothing else. Non-smokers also have rights. in some public places they should breath authenthic pollution, and they damage themselves without smoking.

Smoking is one of those realities that not only has to carry the burden of being a politically incorrect habit, but also one of those things which are fashionable to criticise. We rarely see anyone protesting behemently against the progressive deterioration of public school funding in Spain, but as soon as the topic of smoking is brought up, we will undoubtely hear someone raising his voice against it. Facts aginst it are, on the other hand, well known by everybody : people dying of terminal illnesses, yellow fingers, black teeth... It would seem logical to assume that we need to stop this habit. But should we? As almost everythibng in life, smoking is something xxx. What is the point in making something as that illegal? Wouldn't it be for ther worst? Hystory teaches us that banning something only serves to create a bigger demand for it and illegal ways of getting it . Then, on the other hand, stands the issue of passive smokerss. Why people who don't like to smoke should have to start smoke-polluted air? It seems reasonable to legislate in some way the conditions on which smokers should be able to practice therir habit without disturbing non-smokers, the point here is understnding: Smoking will never be illegal although many people would like it to be that way, and neither would smoking be allowed everywhere, even when many smokers would love it. Smoking should be restricted in public areas, but not illegalised, or prohibited. That would be and extreme decision which would only create discomfort, as it already does in many countries. Unfortunately, those decisions are politically correct.
In my opinion smoking in public places should be illegal. There are many reasons to defend this idea. Firstly smoking is completely unhealthy not only for smokers but also for people around smokers. Tobacco provokes a lot of problems in people such as illnesses related to breath and also psychological complications such as anxiety, dependency and adiction. Apart from these problems, which are directly related to the body, there are also economic disadvantages; smoking implies to spend money to buy tobacco, and it is not precisely a cheap "habbit". But one of the most important problems of smoking is that doing this near other people smokers damage these non-smoking people. I mainly refer to children and pregnant women, although tobacco affects wrongly everybody. Fortunately there are areas for non smokers, but there should be more, for instance in places such as restaurants, pubs, universities, etc. The sensation that I feel when I come in a pub is horrible: my eyes and my nose suffer too much and the smell of tobacco is horrible. I think that Spanish should follow the example of other European countries and create more areas where smoking is restricted. I accept that a person wants to smoke and that he/sh likes it but what I can not accept is that this person damage other people with his/her smoking. I think that tobacco is one of the worst discovers because it is something that does not cause damage, but this is only apparently, because the fact is that smoking kills people. I consider too sad to see may people dying because of smoking. There should be more advertisment to warn about the consequences of smoking in order to make people aware about them. Another important question about smoking is the type of advertisment that tobacco companies make in order to get great benefits. On TV commercials about smoking tobacco is presented as something young, miodern, funny, etc. The message that they try to communicate is that if you smoke these cigarrettes you will be like them; this implies that you will be young, modern, fashionable, etc. Because of this many young children begin to smoke too young because doing it they feel fashionable. But these TV commercials do not talk about the wrong consequences of smoking. In my opinion these kind of commercials should be more severe and serious or simply and better do not exist. So, as I have said, smoking should be illegal because it is an enemy for the health of everybody. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve, so one right way to destroy it would be to make aware people and show to the youngest the dark side of smoking, which is its unique side.
