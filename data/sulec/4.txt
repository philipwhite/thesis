In my opinion, I think the question is not if “money is the root of all evil”, because obviously money is necessary for living, but I think that the matter is just like about who has the “Money”. I mean, if you look at the socio-economic situation of the world you can see that the most of the resources and the access to information belong or are ruled and controlles by a very little part of human beings, whose are living in the so-called 1rst World, while the rest of humanity must live with the minimum for surviving. So, I think that is not an acceptable situation. We are, in a certain way, responsible of this situation, and we have to work very hard if we want to change something and we also have to try that those less-favorablished countries and people could live with dignity and improve their expectatives.
I am a 24 year-old woman and ever since I was born (well, perhaps ever since I was a kid) I was conscious that money was extremely important. It means it all to some people. Without money you are nothing in this society. Every time I turn on my televion set and I switch on the news, all I find are wars, murders, thievery, exploitation, discrimination…I suppose there are several reasons for these horrible affairs and issues, but all this evil shares a common root which is money. If money did not exist, this world would probably be a better place. Not perfect, perhaps, but many of our problems would disappear. The importance humankind gives to money is outrageous. We are losing our moarl. We could rather have mor cents in our pocket than help poor people and beggars who plead on sidewalks and streets. People are dying of hunger and all we worry about is having a larger car or a better music equipment.
Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. This “problem” has many consequences. When students leave university and they decided to look for a job they find many difficulties. These students know theoric question, they can give exact definitions about a great number of terms. But they are not able of making some practices such as, explain a theme or a subject to a child or do all the things that they know theoretically. Most people think that they have a university degree and they don’t know nothing. They are uncaple of developing simple activities. They associate their future with darkness. In fact, in some occasions they think that even a baker is more prepare than they for the real world. A world in which you have to look for a job, and in this situation, another problem is: Where can I go for finding a job? Actually, a young boy finishes his degree and the first thing or idea that appears in his mind is now, what? All students have many questions and few answer. And, of course, they also feel fear because they are secure that they are not prepared for develop a job. How can a “new” doctor open a body of a human if he has never do it? One of the most difficult things is to find answers for all these questions.
