I think that smoking in public places should be illegal because if a person doesn't smoke but this is in a public place where the people around it are smoking, it can be annoying for this person. Furthermore, it can be prejudicial. It also can be an aid for people that smoking because in this way a lot of this people don't smoke in the future. I think that people smoke for habit because when you are in a bar or caffetery and you are having a coffee or beer around you, there are a lot of people smoke and it can infer in that you also smoke. So if all the people don't smoke in public place when you don't see anybody smoke you don't also want a cigarrette. On the other hand people that not smoke if they are in a peace where the people are smoking they are inhaling the smoke and this is bad for their healthy. And I think that people that not smoke don't have why inhale smoke if they don't want. For that reason, I think that smoke in public place should be illegal, for the people that don't smoke. Finally I think that only should be legal to smoke in the streets, open places or in their own houses.
From my point of view, university degrees are probably part-useful for the real world. In other words, the content of degrees should be reviewed in depth and more oftenly. Most of subjects I've had to do are worthless and people just consider them as subjects which will reduce your HUGE amount of credits for completing your grade. But there are a few other subjects I found interesting and useful at the same time. These ones combined with some practical hours would be more accurate for preparing future professional in each area. My experience in other universities provided me knowledge about alternatives in educational systems. I think investigation is better than exams.
I agree with the topic of this composition in some way, so I will explain my position from my personal case. There are some university degrees as the one I am finishing this year, English Phylology, in which you are not prepared to what most of the students want to do in the future, become a teacher. This degree focuses to a great extent on linguistics and literature, leaving methodology apart. Methodology is necessary if you want to teach in the future, and it is an optional rather than a compulsory course to be followed. Subjects like these focus on practice more than in theory, they show the students how to behave in their future jobs. The great load of literature and linguistic knowledge you acquire during the degree is really useful if you want to follow a PHD afterwards, but this is not the case of the majority of students. But the case of English Phylology is not an isolated one. The rest of phylologies have the same problem, and apart from that, degrees like Computers have a similar situation. Students decide to do this degree because they like computers and know how to use them and what they find is a great load of physics and theory, mainly during the first and second year. Due to this, students are choosing more and more to follow a kind of course that is taken in the high school instead of in the universities, and lasts less than three years. In the last year you are given the chance to put your knowledge in practice in an enterprise. These courses are not very important for their C.V. but some people are given the chance to keep on working in the enterprises and their contracts are no longer temporal. I think that degrees should be more oriented to the proffessional future and to the necessity of students interested in taking a specific job (teacher, computer engeneering). To solve this they should make the two first years of each degree common to every student and then separate them in a group for the ones who want to take a PHD and another group for the ones who are more interested in find a job as soon as possible.
The marriage of persons of the same sex should be allowed. It's unfair because as human beings all of us have the same rights. First of all, some people don't accept it but it must not be important because maybe homosexuals do not accept marriage between heterosexuals. I think it is unfair because everybody in the same country should have the same opportunities. They are also people that want make a family. Too many people is probably worried about the future, about a world ful of homosexuals, but the point is that a wide range of important and brilliant authors have been known as homosexuals through decades, as Federico Garcia Lorca or Oscar Wilde. If people do not care of that and think about the brilliant careers of these men, why do not people think of the personal qualities of every person? Some people treat homosexuality as an illness. Why is not discrimination an illness or pathology? Government treat it as a problem, but is not, it is a fact. Then, goverment should think more deeply of other real problems. That marriage is only something that has to be done and some citizens will need time to approve it.
The Government shouldn't ban in public places because people who don't smoke enjoy of some free places of tobacco but what happens with people who smoke? I agree that we must preserve places where people can't smoke for no-smokers because they have their rights to not breathe the polluted air. However, smokers have their right too to smoke in any part but at least in a specific place. The new law doesn't allow to smoke in pubs, clubs, etc. and this is one of the places where people more have cigarettes so it will be a problem for the owners and for the customers. Moreover, it is a contradiction that the Government bans are of its big incomes; in one hand the Government is absolutely against the consume of tobacco because is worse for the health, everybody agrees, but in the other hand is one of the bigger incomes of it and everyday we can find cheaper brands of tobacco, which is helpful for young people; this is what the Government must control, don't make young consumers, that is my point of view the key of the problem.
WHAT'S MARRIAGE? IS IT JUST A MATTER OF RELIGION, OR A MATTER OF CIVIL RIGHTS? BOTH OPTIONS ARE VALID, BECAUSE ANYONE CAN GET MARRIED BECAUSE OF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS, OR WITH THE AIM OF GETTING SOME CIVIL RIGHTS. WHEN PERSONS OF THE SAME SEX ARE ATTEMPTING TO GET MARRIED, THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE THE REASONS EXPLAINED ABOVE. BUT JUST WHEN PEOPLE EXPRESS THEIR REFUSAL TO HOMOSEXUAL MARRIAGES, THEY ARE SEPARATING THIS COLECTIVE FROM THE REST OF SOCIETY, ALIENATING AND SEGREGATING THEM. ON ONE HAND, I THINK THIS ATTITUDE IS NOT FAIR BECAUSE ONE'S SEXUAL TENDENCY IS NOT DETERMINED BY RELIGIONS, SO YOU MAY BE GAY AND, AT THE SAME TIME, HAVE A STRONG BELIEF IN YOUR GOD. ON THE OTHER HAND, MARRIAGE IS SUPPOSED TO BE BASED ON LOVE, AND THIS CONCEPT OF LOVE HAS BEEN ALTERED THROUGH HISTORY BY RELIGIONS AND OTHER SOCIAL FACTORS. IN MY OPINION, WHEN YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE, THAT "SOMEONE" SHOULD BE A PERSON, AND NOT A SPECIFIC GENDER. I MEAN, YOU MAY LIKE A PERSON, INDEPENDENTLY OF HIS OR HER SEX; I DON'T SEE THE POINT IN LIMITING OURSELVES IN ADVANCE. BESIDES, OUR THOUGHTS SHOULD REFLECT THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE TODAY, INSTEAD OF THINKING ABOUT LOVE AS A MATTER OF REPRODUCTION.
