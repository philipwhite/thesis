The consumption of tobacco should be banned in public places. Smokers can make use of their rights in many places without disturbing other people. Furthermore, the rights of non-smokers should prevail before the ones of smokers, the health before the disease. We should not forget that tobacco is one of the main causes of death in our country nowadays, so if you decide to die, you don't have to condemn others to death. As mentioned before, a person who usually smokes has a lot of places to do it, and he should avoid disturbing others. Nowadays there have been established laws thaty impose the restriction of reserved areas for smokers in public places. However, harder laws should be passed in order to make these spaces to be respected. What's more, penalties should be imposed to those who do not respect them. Smokers can make use of their rights in these public reserved zones and they can also do it in private places such as their cars or their houses. The rights of non-smokers should have a greater weight in society, as they take care of their healteh when they make the decision of non-smoking. The health should prevail before the disease, specially when pregnant women and children become the victims of the smoke of the tobacco indirectly .
I agree with this statement because I consider that nowadays the University doesn´t prepare students for the real world. Classes are principally theoretical and in my case, for example, if I want to learn a language I know that I must travel abroad because if I stay here I´ll never learn it. I would like to have more practical classes with more speaking and learnings´exercises. I have the impression that when I finish the career I will not know to speak English (or other language) as I would have wanted. It´s the hard reality! I also think that Spanish educational system is worse thatn other European systems and it is reflected in the high level of unemployment. Students are less prepared than other European students. After, when they must get a job they don´t act as it´s expected. Another cause is the lack of help from governments, which are more interested in financial, economical and territorial issues than in educational problems. It´s very ashamed! Without a serious education we will never integrate in a plural society.
Through all our life we are told what to do, what it is morally wrong and what is not. Some people feel free to talk about everything, but they do not realize that most of the times they talk only through their point of view.They think they are the truth, and thus they do not care about other people feelings and as a consequence these 'gods of the word' are preventing people's most valuable thing: freedom. If we focused our speech on Spanish homosexual marriages there should not be any point of dicussion and the answer should be very easy. 'Should the marriage of persons of the same sex be allowed?', 'Yes'. The reason to this is that our main law, the Constitution, is based on the principle that every individual is free. Any individual of the Spanish society can do everything he wants to since he does not hurt psychologically or physically any other. Taking this statement as a referent there should not be any difficulty to answer the question made. But although our society is based on this old principle many sectors of society are against it. These groups' thoughts are similar in all the rest of the world. We can add then that the rest of the world does not have the same Constitution we do, and this would be a reasonable and true opinion. The United States of America are not ruled by Spanish Constitution, neither Russia, nor Italy, but they all have one aspect in common. All these countries are formed by human beings and humanity is controlled by a kind of universal law, which is the Human Rights. In my opinion and probably in the opinion of the people that allowed their signature to be on the Declaration of the Human Rights, every decission taken must be under consideration of this sense of freedom and respect. If people do not respect each other there would never be freedom, thus the more fragile individuals will always be governed by the strong and powerful. Besides, if some people say the only believed in God's word we may say to them that the first and main point of Christianity is to love each other as oneself. People should love and respect the others without paying any attention to their culture, colour of sin, sexuality, ... Although taking into consideration all these legal aspects, both political and religious, there is one factor that we can not forget, which is: history. People are conditionated through history under a patriarchal society, where the family is the main important element. This family will be formed by a man, a woman and their children, and anything that will go against this will be considered odd and irregular, but what is worst, it will be considered illegal. All in all, if we want to live in a better place, where people will feel free and live in harmony and peace, the main element will be respect,and thus every body should be able to decide who they want to live with, and who they want to love, without any kind of restrictions; through this we could be able to say that we live based on the terms of Freedom and respect.
