It has been said that all that money touches becomes corrupted, and it may be true. If we think about all the problems that ambition causes, maybe we will be less ambitious and may be we will give more importance to the things that really have it. How many are the cases of people that killed for money, that left their families for searching the great oportunity of their lives: that is to become rich. I’m not saying that all who wants money can be a bad person, but money is not at all good reason for making something so terrible as comitt a crime. Money, it’s impossible to live without it, and it is demostrated everyday and in everywhere that if you don’t have money, you are nothing. It sounds radical that the fact of having or not money can determine our way of life and what we are, but in this capitalist society in which we live, money is the religion of almost everyone. However, there are some people who give money the importance that it really has, that is, money as something transitory, that could bring us some happy because it allows us to buy food, clothes, to have some pleasures in life, but we cannot forget that money can-not buy everything, it cannot buy health or life. Money is not the root of evil, it’s only a temptation which may lead us to evil. It has its valor as everything has. The evil emerges from the people who do not recognise the real valor of money; and these people discover later or soon in their lives that money isn’t the most important in this life.
One can think that money is the root of all evil because it seems clear enough that when someone is the owner of a big amount of money they are supossed to be something else, almost a Godness by society. Form this point of view, it is easy to imagine the differences between such “special being” and the rest of mortals, I means that this person is allowed to doing everything he/she wanted and, of course, this fact provokes a lot of problems and wakes up a sort of bad feelings towards both parts. The rich person also begins to separate from the part of society different to him/her and usually his/her only target is to get more and more money and to go up in the social scale (It nevermind who you must “smash”). But, there are a huge amount of evils that are not consquence of the money such as quakes, disseases, traffic accidents, etc… I think it is not money the root of all evil. We are the guilties but we need an excuse and money is the perfect one. If we try to imagine a society where money doesn’t exist in order to avoid social differences it will be the same that if we try to imagine a society where all citizens have a lot of money, the same amount of money. They would have money but they wouldn’t be corrupted because there wouldn’t be differences between them. So, as far as I am concerned, envy is more dangerous than money.
In the days we are living, it seems as if money ruled our society: There is a well known proverb, which says: money makes the world go round. Unfortunately, this saying is true due to the fact that, nowadays without money you have no importance. In these violent days we are living, there is a dimension of truth in saying that money is the root of all evil. A few bills or some golden coins in our purse may make us really happy but they can also destroys someone’s life. If one owes money to other person, he can be attacked, if it is to the bank that he owes it, he may lose his house, if a third world country is in debt with a rich one, it may be invaded or denied any kind of help. The question is, where do we go without money? Nowhere seems to be the most likely answer. The worst things happening nowadays in the world seems to have their origin because of economic reasons. Wars, famine in underdeveloped countries, terrorism or ecological disasters. Someone must have some profit with all these disgraces, otherwise it seems probable that some person or institution may have the solution to solve these global problems. Times when making money with one’s effort seem to be lost, while the important thing seems to be making a large amount of money as soon as possible without thinking in the consequences this practice can have.
