After being in Santiago for about five years studying English Philology, I totally agree with the fact that this degree is basically theoretical. Yes, Palacios, it is theoretical because we were not taught from the practical point of view. Thousands of books to read just before the exam without taking time for thinking and analysing them carefully. English Philology students don’t know literature in depth and that makes them to go abroad in order to get the language skills. As far as I remember, the last course of English lasted a couple of hours a week, so I did have to go to a private academy in Santiago to keep up with my English. Just if you think about how many times we presented any topic orally, you would realize that English Philology is not good for practical aims. As far as the teaching is concerned, I would assure that we are not well-prepared. We need more didactic background and CAP course is very little. On the contrary, we’d rather make this situation a bit more positive by listing a few tips which may be useful to take into account and they are as follows: - You should make students to think about the current tendencies about methodological methods which I know you did in Perspectivas Metodológicas but only one subject is not enough. - You should make students to talk about any of the units of the programme in front of the other students as a real class. - More English language practice is strongly neccessary as me myself and many other classmates are still in advanced level trying to pass the Proficiency Exam and Oposiciones about Secondary Education. - More things need to be said but I don’t have enough space, so I am 28 years old and there’s no POST for me.
Smoking is an old deal that nowadays has gained much actuallity. This is a bad habit that makes great damage to health, as the doctors usually claim; but it wasn't until recently that people got really concerned about this problem, and so did Government. The government has been taking in the last years different measures to stop people from smoking, the latest one in which they are thinking about is making illegal smoking in public places. Great polemic has risen because of this government's proposal. Firstly, smokers believe that it goes against people's freedom, because it implies a restriction for a certain group of people not letting them behave in their usual way. Connected with this, special places for smokers are being available in some public places. Although it seems a good measure, smokers understand it as a discrimination and moreover, the bad image the media gives about smokers increase this bad feeling. On the other side, non-smokers also claim for their right to be in public place cleared of smokers. As they have decided not to smoke, they expect not to suffer the bad consequences of other's smoke (it is believed that if you are next to a person smoking, you're also smoking part of his cigarrette). In this sense, they would probably agree with making smoking illegal in public places. Even though, many of them could possibly think that it's a better measure to enable special places for smokers, so that they can go to the same places as the non-smokers. To conclude, I'd like to say that I'm a non-smoker person and, having in account both sides of the problem, I think that it's not fair making smoking illegal in public places, as everybody has the right to decide where he wants to go.
I finished my degree three years ago, and some of my friends have finished this year, so this is a question we were talking a lot recently. I think it has a difficult solution, is very easy, in a chat with friends, to talk about the things that are wrong and the way to solv it, but to be able to do it can be really difficult. In one hand, you have to learn a lot of things in just five years! It's imposible to learn everything about something, it doesn't matter what, in such a few time. I mean, no one is able to learn in five years what a proffesional learns in thirty years of work. So a degree, must shows you the bases, the main things and how to solv the problems you will find in your work, and I asure they will be a lot . Therefore you have to learn a lot of information in a few time and I don't know another way, appart from studying, to learn this amount of things. In the other hand, I don't agree with the method of a teacher speaking an hour long and the students writting what he is saying without understanding what they are writting. I'm sure that there are better ways of doing things. To me, the most important job of a teacher is to make the students understand what he or she is teaching. In conclusion, it's difficult to change things, I know, but maybe a mix of both ways would be better. I remember teachers saying the first day of the class, that it was a difficult subject and everyone will fail if we didn't study really hard. I think they were wrong, I think they were bad teacher because they didn't know how to make us understand what they were teaching us.
