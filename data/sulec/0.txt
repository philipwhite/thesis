Thinking about university degrees, I think that most of students agree on the idea that nowadays universities offer a kind of degrees that have mainly theoretical contents, and so, the practical part has little importance or it has less importance than it should have. Taking as starting point my own experience, I can say that in my degree, which is English Philology, most of the contents are only theoretical which is paradoxical if you think that most of people are going to focus their future on the teaching of English as a foreign language either in high schools, in universities or giving particular classes; so, why don’t we have any subject focused on the way of teaching students a foreign language? There are other degrees in which students have some hours in which they have to go to a school and they became teachers for a while, and that’s all before having their degree finished, but that happens only in this case, but not in my degree. I think that this kind of practical contents are necessary, because if you are not taught how to share your knowledge with your students, It is very easy that you do not find the way to explain concepts that you find very obvious, or maybe you will explain them in a way that would not be adequate for students; and if you do not know how to teach what you know it is not important the great amount of concepts that you can know; for example, if a person that is studying medicine does not put in practice all the concepts achieved during the degree, I don’t think that once he has the title he can say that he’s a doctor, because he’s not going to be able of dealing with ill people in spite of all his theoretical knowledge. I think that practice is even the most important part of a degree, because if you go to the real world you can find that there are a lot of people capable of doing their work very well without having a specific theoretical preparation for it , because practice has taught them how to make work better and how to work in the easiest way possible, but we can also find the other way round: we can see that there are a lot of people that have finished their degrees and that are not able of facing their new work without the help of that experienced people. Taking into account all this, I think that we are not going to be prepared for facing the label market once we have ended our degree because we lack the experience that we are going to be asked; because with this kind of educational system is not easy to fit the prototype of worker that the companies want : young , well prepared and with practical experience; so if you adopt a very critical point of view you will probably end by saying that this kind of theoretical degrees are of a very little value.
I agree with this topic because I am studying English Philology and all is theoretical and it does not prepare us for the real life. We only have some real work when we do the C.A.P. and it is only for a couple of months…and this is not time enough. I think that one of the degrees that most helps students for the real life is “magisterio” because my sister is studying this degree and she has practice classes that consist in going to schools and helping the teachers that are working there. She also works in the class with the students as if she was the teacher and not the practice teacher….and she enjoy it. And I have said this example because I know what really happens because I have somebody near that told me her case. But I have other friends and they all share the same opinion…they feel that they are not going to be well prepared studying in the way they do and think that their degrees are too much theoretical and do not prepare them for the outside life. I do not think that the fact of introducing hundreds and hundreds of ideas, lessons, etc in ones heads helps you to be better prepared … because somebody can be a very good student but can not work correctly and somebody that does not like to study can do his/ her work correctly. I also think that a more practice class could be a very good method for encouraging people to do more things, to motivate the students to go at class, to prepare themselves better, etc. I honestly have to say that the degree that I am studying is completely different of what I thought it was going to be. I will explain myself better: when I chose this degree ( because I was not sure because I also want to study psychology) I thought it was going to be quite different: with more English lessons, more oral lessons, more practice…because the fact of studying lots of authors, studying the English history does not help you to speak English better….and if you want to be a English teacher the only lesson that can help you is the C.A.P. when you have already have finished the degree or “perspectives” and this is not enough. So I think that the degrees or most of them should be checked over again because it can be a motive for giving up studies or when you finish you notice that all what you have studied does not help you for what is waiting for you in the real life. Because finding a good job is very difficult nowadays.. there are too little good jobs for too many prepared people…it is really a competition…and only the best can win. So everybody, the university system, the government should do something to arrange the problem.
This topic in my opinion is very realistic in the sense of we, the students, are not really prepared for the real world. I am going to begin talking about my career because it is about what more knowledge I have. It is true that, philology students had to do the C.A.P. to can teach in a school, but this course is not sufficient for us. During the fifth years of career we have practical classes, minimal practical classes in which above all we have to talk, but some students that are shy are not going to talk there and obviously the teacher is not going to force it to talk, because there are more students and the class is very short in time. Besides, in the university the treatment of the classes and the students is obviously again very different from the high school, because of the number of students. I know that if you are studying a career you should be sufficient coherent and mature to know your priorities and if you want to improve your English you should speak even a little. I know, by mouth of some friends that another careers are the same than mine, because in the university, in what a teacher is interested, is in giving you the main information about that career, it is normal that in a career about Law, you cannot go to a City Hall if you are not prepared theoretically first, or in an example even more obvious the Medicine career: this kind of career needs a very practical classes because in their hands ( when they be doctors ) will be our lives, and we, as a teachers, will have to explain to a group of children some information about a language, or literature ( although it can be more dangerous ). In relation to the C.A.P I think that in only three or four months is not sufficient to prepared us, and since you finish the C.A.P until you got a job you forget all that you learn and while the time passes you have less opportunities to get a job as a teacher; you want independence and you get a temporal job meanwhile you prepared oppositions and if you have the luck of getting a job, you accommodate there and think: why am I going to continue studying if I have money, a house, a boyfriend…? It is true that there are a lot of people and that all are not at the same way, but in my case that I am 26 years old I am thinking in finishing the career to can live with my boyfriend as soon as possible, and if I want do it I have to work, and I have to work in the first thing I can; of course I would like to be a teacher or something related to it and I have been thinking in giving classes to old people, because it can be more interesting. This is, in a way, treated since a point of view very subjective, but if we think in this topic since an objective point of view, I would say that in general all careers have only theoretical preparation, but although we, students, had practical classes during all the career and several hours a day, we will nor prepared for the real world. I think that until you be in the laborer world more or less two or three years you will not prepared for working on it. You will be able to do your job perfectly, but the laborer world is very hard.
