I think the marriage of persons of the same sex should be allowed because they are persons, and if the marriage of persons of the diferent sex is good for all people, should be it of the persons of the same sex, too. If someone do not be secure with persons of the diferent sex, if one person do not like other person of other sex but on the other hand that person fall in love with person of the same sex, why they not would get marriage? In My opinion, people that said the marriage of persons of the same sex shouldn’t be allowed, they said that because they feel nervous with this people. I think that those people thinkthat they are more important or more intelligent that persons get marriage with persons of the same sex and this would not be. My religion, Catolicism, isn’t agree with marriage of persons of the sme sex, they considered it inmoral, in there opinion is something innatural. Maybe the most people aren’t agree with that marriage because they are very religious and they have got fearxx. In the most countries the marriage of persons of the same sex isn’t allowed. Here, in Spain, those marriages are allow but since a few montsh. To conclusion, in my opinion the marriage of persons of the same sex should be allowed.
From my point of view the marriage of persons of the same sex should be allowed in Spain and all over the world because it's a natural situation provocated by the humanity and we can't avoid that although we don't like it. The unique possibility it's starting to assume it and act according this. In one hand, we should realize in what world we're living and break with the traditional stereotypes. Spain is a catolic country that's why catolic people don't understand the marriage of persons of the same sex. They don't want to break the structure of the traditional family because they aren't used to taking decisions by themselves. The church and the Catolicism say that the marriage can only made by persons of different sex because it's the natural condition of the humanity. But who are they to say a thing like this??? Heterosexual people? Repressived people? Traditional people? In the other hand, they're too many people who should have the same opportunities like others ones. Nowadays, the freedom to choose what you want or what you need is the most important thing for us. However, there's another main feature in all this and it's the important of the love. It's very difficult to find the appropriate person to spend all your life and if you get it why you should be worry about his or her sex. The happiness is something more deep.
Our education is suppose to be a way of working in the real life, but the truth is that you finish your studies and then starts a new education. I have just finished my physiks degree. When you finish it, you think "oh, fantastic, I can work!" and then the reality sticks you. The first thing is doing the curriculum vitae. "OK, fine", it takes you a long time, but you do it. Then you go to the INEM office, and they ask you what studies you have. OK, no problem. The INEM will not find you a job so you don't care. The next step is the Internet, and that is the moment you realize, you are not prepared for working. You are looking for a job where experience is not required because you don't have it, but the problem is not the experience only, because you have to know a lot of computer languages that haven't been teached to you. My degree has a lot of practical subjects, but in none of these I learn a word about what I am asked for in most jobs. Some of thing you must know to go into jobs world are very specific, but most of are not. So after being working hard for getting the degree you start again, this time you have the degree but you don't have the knowkledge so you know what you must do: you must spend a year learning, for being teacher: the CAP. If you want to became a doctor: you prepare the "Tesina" and the "Tesis". If you want to work in a firm: Any kind of computering languages and programs. In the most of cases: Doing a master and spending more money that you don't have. Some people do practise in a firm in a way that the firm teaches what they need for working and then they give them a job. And after that I ask myself: Why on hearth did nobody teach me what I really need? I'm sure that I'm lucky in having a degree, maybe my jobs conditions are not good, but if I don't have it, they would be worst. I think the main problem is that the university degrees are not planned for working, just for learning. You must learn a lot of different subjects you will never find out where is the use or the interest. A friend of mine says that a degree is no more than a obstacles race for getting a "medal": a degree I studyed a degree that has a lot of practical subjects and I have this problem, but what does it happens in the degrees that don't have it?The rates of unemployed people are there. A lot of people is working in something that they haven't learn in their degree and a FP studient is better qualified than a university student in at least half time and much less studied.
