I think that most university degrees are very theoretical, so students finish their careers with a lack of acknowledge. Otherwise I don't think that the spanish university degrees were valueless. In my opinion, our students have a strong theoretical acknowledgement that can help them to find a job, but perhaps there were a lack of practical in the careers that they are forced to improve. We must center the reasons of this problems. Firstly we have the longest careers in Europe, but it seems like all this time were useless. Are we really spending all this years studing unuseful things? I don't think so. I think that the point of view in other countries is different. They explain a more practical lections and reduces the contents comparing with our careers. The students learn less, but what they learn is useful to the jobs they wer going to develop. In Spain, a university student learn a lot of things that would make him or her capable of developing a great number of jobs. What is better? Secondly, society has been changing so fast in the latest years that the rigid structures in the University were not able to change with this speed. Sometimes I feel like teachers and students were amazing and wandering, wondering what's happening or what's wrong in University. And worse is that noone knows where are University going. That's is the third great problems. Suddenly, a change is necessary! Thus politics began to change without thinking, against all - teachers and students. All people in University became crazy and desoriented but finally nothing changed. Noone want to take serious change, so we change a couple of things and feel calm. Summing up, there are a lot of problems at the University. I think that the most important is make a serious revision of the contents of each subject and even of the subjects of each careers, offer a good study of what the society is needing.
Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. At first, I would say that I am studying Magisterio, because I would like to become an English teacher. I don't know how is this theme in any other university degree, but I can talk about the one that I am studying. Along the three years that occupates this university degree, students have near three months of practical situations. I mean, during the second year we have a month and a half to stay in a Primary School and during the third year we have another month and a half. I have learnt more during those three months that I have been working in a school with "real teachers" that during the three years that I have been receiving theoretical in class. When I went to have my first experience in a school I wasn't prepared at all because nobody at university tought me how to be in front of twelve or fifteen boys and girls waiting for you to teach them something interesting. The first thing I thought was that I would never reach my goal, that it was to become a good school teacher. Most part of my university subjects don't prepare students for the real world, even more, I would say that most of them don't help students to learn what they have to learn for the real life, what is suppose to do. Finally I would say that as my case, there would be a lot more, but I only can talk about what I know, and I think that most university degrees don't prepare students for real world.
Most university degrees are only theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. For example, in Spain there are many degrees that are only theoretical. Many students who are studing a degree they have only theoretical classes and they have few practical classes. They should revindicate their rights for having more practical classes. But the problem of not having practical classes comes when a student finishes his degree and he starts to work. In that moment, the student realizes that the theories that he was learning during the degree were not useful for everyday life. Because in a job you should use the theories that you learnt before but you have to apply them to practical projects. Nowadays, there are many degrees where there is no practice. For example, degrees such as philosophy, law, science ... This degrees should have many practice, because a person who is learning a language should have many native teachers, and grants to go to the country where it speaks this language. For example, in law they should work in offices with lawers to know how they work ... So, every degree should have more practice than theory and in that way the students finish the degree in a useful way and they should be ready to work.
