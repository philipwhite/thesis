I am quite sure about the fact that if you look up the word ‘love’ or even ‘feeling’ in a good dictionary there would be no reference or relation to a particular sex. Feelings or love can be found inside any human being without restrictions, so, why can we restrict the object of the feeling or of love to a person of a sex opposite to the one of the subject who loves or feels? Men and women are able to think and feel in the same way and nobody has enough power to indicate them what do they have to do. Furthermore, according to the Spanish Constitution all human beings are equal, having the same rights and also the same duties; so that, if we understand getting married as a right and if we add the fact that all human beings are free to choose, anybody would have to be allowed to choose the person with whom they would share their life. On the other hand, I believe that people should change their minds and forget the idea that makes them understand getting married, or in other words, putting a signature in a paper, as something so important. From my point of view a signature does not make stronger links between two people, does not increase feelings, does not imply that you are going to give without thinking about what you are going to receive. Do people think that they are selling their lifes or even their whole existence to their lovers? It is quite difficult, even impossible for me to introduce myself inside the mind of married people: what are their values? Why did they choose this option? Was it just a mere tradition in their families? But ignoring all those questions for which I would never find one answer, if I had to make up a theory to explain the taste of people for getting married I would come to the conclusion that we are so insecure, that we are so afraid of feeling alone that we look for a strong link, something difficult to destroy among people, we want to be sure that we are going to have at least one person next to us for all our lifes. So that, and to sum up, all people should have the same opportunities, marriage would be allowed for everybody but maybe after visiting a pair of psychologists to clearing up our minds.
To prohibit smoking in public places is important, we could see everyday information that talkabout this injurious habit. Most people in our society is concerned about the problem, but they’re still some who keep on breaking the rules. It isn’t difficult to see someone smoking a cigarrette on a bus even when is prohibit, or next to a pregnant women, even though we know it may be dangerous for her baby. The sanitary authorities are making great efforts in order to help people to leave that unhealthy habit, they promove special courses and give prizes as trips I can understand those people who thinkwe’re hunting smokers, they have special places in restaurants, planes, trains... But as I see it, we need to preserve our health. I have not chosen smoking,so I have the right of breathing pure air. Their freedom ends where it starts mine. In my opinion it is neccesary to forbid smoking in public places, but perhaps making sure that the law is respected is even more neccesary. Nowadays they’ve got the chance and the help to leave smoking, we can’t do more.
This is a very controversial theme, because there are very different opinions about, and that problem can affect the rights of the people non smoker, and as well, of people who smoke, because people non smoker people should have the right to inhale pure air and they shouldn’t have to suffer the effects of the toxic air the smokers cause, such as lungs’ cancer and heart’s infart, that is demostrated that are caused by nocive effects of smoking, and the fact that the smokers made the clean air become dirty make the non-smoker inhale it and have the effects it does on smokers. It could be a really nice question to ask about the fact that the industries make the world’s air get dirty, but this isn’t the theme we’re talking about today. Smoking shouldn’t be allowed, because, such as cocaine or crack, is very bad for health, it could cause people die, but the problem to stop allowing it is the fact that it generates really nice money, and it wouldn’t healp a country to stop it while other countries keep allowing it, this problem is similar to weapons, no one country wants to stop getting them, but if one does, it would be an easy attack point for others.
