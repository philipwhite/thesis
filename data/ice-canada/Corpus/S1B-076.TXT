<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-076#86:1:B> Spaldings <?> are </?> a really good ski actually

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-076#87:1:A> Ya but they're old
<ICE-CAN:S1B-076#88:1:A> I mean they were like at least

</[> they're probably like at least fifteen years old

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-076#90:1:B> <[> Mhh hmm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-076#91:1:A> And <,> I took them

know took the skis and the guy said to me he goes these skis are not safe to

ski on because the bindings are so old

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-076#93:1:B> Mhh hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-076#94:1:A> And <,> I was like oh okay whatever

</}> I skied on them anyway for that day and then I hung them up <,> that

night and the next time like I went to the country the binding was lying on

the floor <O> laugh </O> next to the ski
