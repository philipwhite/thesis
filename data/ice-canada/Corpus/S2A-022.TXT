<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-022#1:1:A> <O> laugh </O> Thank you very much <@> Carly </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#2:1:A> Uhm <,> I could probably talk to you for two hours without stopping

about what's going on at the Cegep <&> Collège d'enseignement général et

professionel </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#3:1:A> Uh <,> what I would like to do is give you some general information
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#4:1:A> And please <}> <-> jump </-> <=> if you have any questions I think

the simplest thing is just jump </=> </}> in if you have a question

something's not clear what are you talking about or someone told me that is

that really true
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#5:1:A> Uhh <,,> please the information in here is for you so uh <,> uh

<unclear> word </unclear> what you want to know about
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#6:1:A> Maybe just very quickly <}> <-> to </-> <=> to </=> </}> step back

before August of this uh present school year to what the Cegep was before the

reform hit <,> and certainly knocked E S L <&> English as a Second Language

</&> requirements out of all recognition
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#7:1:A> Uhm <,> roughly before that we probably had about ten percent of the

student population taking English courses <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#8:1:A> More in Montreal <,> uhh less in the uh outlying regions
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#9:1:A> That was roughly the clientele
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#10:1:A> Some programs had English as uh a compulsory course
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#11:1:A> Uh for example language programs
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#12:1:A> Computer Science had ahh an English that was compulsory <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#13:1:A> Uhm <,> Office Management Technology had several English courses uh

business English courses compulsory
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#14:1:A> Uh and a certain amount of that some of it depended on <,>

provincial <,> coordination programs
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#15:1:A> Others <,> local Cegeps could decide okay we're going to put

English into this program
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#16:1:A> Uhm <,,> aside from that I think maybe seventy-five percent of the

students took English as an elective
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#17:1:A> So they were there because <}> <-> they'd </-> <=> they'd </=> </}>

chosen they wanted to be
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#18:1:A> Uh with the reform we now have a hundred percent of the student

body in English courses
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#19:1:A> Uh whether they like it or not they're there <,> and they have to

pass two courses before they get <}> <-> their </-> <=> their </=> </}>

diploma <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#20:1:A> Some teachers felt that uh this would <,> create a <,,> a what

division excitement whatever in the classroom uhh but from what I've heard I

haven't heard <,> very many if any negative comments that these students

don't want to take English courses
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#21:1:A> Uh they may have trouble with <}> <-> the </-> <=> <}> <-> <.> w

</.> </-> <=> what's </=> </}> </=> </}> expected of them <,> but there's

certainly no big beef that gee we don't think we should have to learn English
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#22:1:A> So <}> <-> that </-> <=> that's </=> </}> one view that has not in

fact materialized <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#23:1:A> Another bit of background is what the <}> <-> course </-> <=> <,>

courses </=> </}> were before
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#24:1:A> There was a description about <,,> ten lines long <,> uh half a

page wide that described what the course was
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#25:1:A> Uh in addition in what was called the <indig> cahier de <unclear>

word </unclear> <?> mots </?> g&eacute;n&eacute;ral </indig> <,,> uhh <,>

there was sort of a profile of the student at the end of <,> these two

courses will be able to blah blah blah and the rest
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#26:1:A> Some teachers were aware of what was in it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#27:1:A> Other teachers weren't
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#28:1:A> Uh it was a fairly <,> wide open field
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#29:1:A> Not to say that the job wasn't well done but it was <,> shall we

say open to interpretation <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#30:1:A> With the reform there are <,> more definite standards
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#31:1:A> Uhm <,> how well they're adhered to we'll find out in a couple of

years once the <,,> proverbial dust settles
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#32:1:A> Uh <,> and to give you an idea of what student now do <,> uh

students in their compulsory courses have <,> what are called <&> sound of

chalk on a blackboard </&> <,,> uh <,,> <indig> cours de formation <,,>

g&eacute;n&eacute;rale </indig> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#33:1:A> Which means in other words you have to do it <,,> <indig> commune

</indig> <,> uhh
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#34:1:A> Hang on I'll go back here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#35:1:A> <indig> Propre </indig> and <?> <indig> compl&eacute;mentaire

</indig> </?> <,,> <&> sound of chalk on a blackboard ends </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#36:1:A> So it's in this block where students have to do a certain number of

courses
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#37:1:A> In <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> <?> <indig>

compl&eacute;mentaire </indig> </?> there are <,> uh three French courses

there are at the moment two Philosophy courses <,> two Phys Ed courses and

one English course that <,> all students take and they're mixed up
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#38:1:A> And no matter what program they're in they end up in <,> one of

these courses
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#39:1:A> Okay <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#40:1:A> Ah one new thing with the reform the first two French courses are

four hours instead of three hours
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#41:1:A> So some hours were added to French <,> although it remained <}> <->

at at </-> <=> at </=> </}> four courses
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#42:1:A> Uh Philosophy lost a course
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#43:1:A> At the moment the Minister is looking <,> into putting an hour into

the <,> first course <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#44:1:A> Uh and at the moment Phys Ed is at two courses although there is a

<,> possibility it may go back up to three
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#45:1:A> An there's one English course <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#46:1:A> Then the Ministry created what's called <indig> cours propre

</indig> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#47:1:A> Uhh try to find the definition <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#48:1:A> Uhh sorry there ain't one
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#49:1:A> Uhm the Ministry doesn't <,> really
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#50:1:A> Well the Ministry sort of has one
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#51:1:A> Uhm <,> <}> <-> I </-> <=> what I </=> </}> have dubbed them <,,>

<&> Chalk sound begins and ends </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#52:1:A> I've been have fun with <,,> making up acronyms of things
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#53:1:A> <}> <-> I've called </-> <=> they're not </=> </}> E S P they're E

S S P <,> English for Sort of a Specific <{> <[> Purpose <,,> </[> uh because

<}> <-> they don't </-> <=> they're not </=> </}> addressed to <,> a program

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2A-022#54:1:Z> <[> <O> laugh </O> <&> Group response </&> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-022#55:1:A> It's not English for Computer Science English for <,> Nursing

English for Business Administration
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#56:1:A> It's English for <,> a group of families that the Cegep has put

together <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#57:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#58:1:A> Uh so that's this
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#59:1:A> In English <}> <-> it's <,> it makes </-> <=> <,> it makes </=>

</}> certainly more sense or it's more obvious than in other courses
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#60:1:A> So if they had an <&> Chalk sound starts </&> English <,,> French

<,,> and Philosophy <&> Chalk sound stops </&> course called <indig> une

cours propre </indig>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#61:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#62:1:A> The other terminology that you may hear <,> also referred to is <,>

<&> Chalk sound starts </&> Block A <,,> Block B <,,> <&> Chalk sound stops

</&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#63:1:A> Uh <,> a lot of different terms <}> <-> were </-> <=> were </=>

</}> bandied about at the beginning and some of them have stayed <,> even

though there is an official term <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#64:1:A> <}> <-> Kay </-> <+> Okay </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#65:1:A> So <,> no matter what program they're in they're all mixed up
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#66:1:A> It sort of depends on timetables
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#67:1:A> They take a course in English in the Block A the <,> <indig>

formation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale commune </indig> and then they have a

<indig> une cours prop </indig> uh and each Cegep decides how the families

will be put together <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#68:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#69:1:A> And the other element of the <indig> formation

g&eacute;n&eacute;rale </indig> is <indig> cours compl&eacute;mentaire

</indig> and those are the electives
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#70:1:A> And with the reform <,> since English has now moved into the <,>

compulsory courses <,> students cannot take English as an elective <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#71:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#72:1:A> So students must take two English courses in their regular program

but <}> <-> they </-> <=> it's </=> </}> not an optional <,> course anymore
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#73:1:A> <}> <-> The </-> <=> the </=> </}> electives are divided into five

or <,> six families uhm <,,> which I don't remember uh but there are things

like uh Technology and Science uhh Human Science uhh Art <,> that sort of

thing uhh and Modern Languages
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#74:1:A> But with the reform the distinction made is that English is <indig>

la langue seconde </indig> in francophone Cegeps and French and anglophone

Cegeps and <indig> langues modernes </indig> is anything <,> excepting

English and French <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#75:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#76:1:A> And <indig> langues modernes </indig> <,> fall under the electives
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#77:1:A> So if it's Spanish or German or Italian or Hebrew or <,> whatever

else it happens to be Russian or Yiddish <,> those are electives and those

<,> are there <,> but English cannot be chosen as an elective by the student

since they automatically have two courses to pass <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#78:1:A> Am I going too fast or if it's not clear give me a holler <O>

question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#79:1:A> For example <}> <-> in uhh </-> <=> there's </=> </}> a new program

coming in uh our Cegep uh Hotel Management <,> Technology <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#80:1:A> For example they have two courses <}> <-> in their </-> <=> in this

</=> </}> block <indig> formation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale commune et propre

</indig> <,> plus <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> other element is <,,>

<&> Chalk starts </&> what's called <{> <[> <indig> formation

sp&eacute;cifique </indig> </[> <,,> and that's all their core programs <&>

Chalk stops </&> <X>

<$ZA> <ICE-CAN:S2A-022#X81:1:Z> <[> <&> whispered response </&> </[> </{> </X>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-022#82:1:A> So for the hotel people it's uhh uhm I don't know what their

courses are uh but <}> <-> in the </-> <=> in the </=> </}> Computer Science

program for example they have Programming this Programming that and all the

rest of it <,> and if there's an English course in there <,> then <}> <-> it

</-> <=> it's </=> </}> obligatory it's not by choice <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#83:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#84:1:A> And in the Hotel Management in addition to their two courses they

have three other English courses that are under <indig> cours

sp&eacute;cifique </indig> <,,> <O> question/answer exchange with

extra-corpus speaker </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-022#85:1:A> I don't know if they're going to change the word Cegep to <{>

<[> <,,> I don't know Cepet or something </[> <X>

<$ZB> <ICE-CAN:S2A-022#X86:1:Z> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[> </{> </X>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-022#87:1:A> But it's now uh what we call <indig> pre-universit&eacute; et

technique </indig> <{> <[> <,> instead </[> of <indig> g&eacute;n&eacute;ral

et professionel </indig> <X>

<$ZB> <ICE-CAN:S2A-022#X88:1:Z> <[> <&> response </&> </[> </{> </X>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-022#89:1:A> That's another <,> bit <}> <-> of <.> technol </.> </-> <=> of

terminology </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#90:1:A> Terminology has changed
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#91:1:A> So what was called <indig> professionel </indig> which in English

translates vocational and not professional in fact <,,> uh is now become

technical <,> and what was general is now pre-university <indig>

pre-universit&eacute; </indig>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#92:1:A> So those are the two
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#93:1:A> So <}> <-> whether </-> <=> whatever </=> </}> program they're in

they have to do <{> <[> <,,> this </[> and this <,> <X>

<$ZB> <ICE-CAN:S2A-022#X94:1:Z> <[> <&> response </&> </[> </{> </X>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-022#95:1:A> And in the <indig> cours compl&eacute;mentaire </indig> at the

moment it's three courses <,> but if Philosophy gains an hour if Phys Ed

gains another course <}> <-> the comp </-> <=> the electives </=> </}> go

from three down to two <O> question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker

</O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-022#96:1:A> Uhm I'll give you the codes for the levels
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#97:1:A> Uhh the new course levels uhm <,> are this <,,> <&> Chalk starts

and stops </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#98:1:A> There are in fact five levels
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#99:1:A> Uh unfortunately with the reform <}> <-> codes </-> <=> they've

decided codes </=> </}> don't mean anything and don't have to mean anything

and they don't mean anything <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#100:1:A> Uhh for example one oh four happens to be lower than one oh one

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#101:1:A> Okay <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#102:1:A> Uh so there are five levels <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#103:1:A> <}> <-> There </-> <=> there's </=> </}> a reason for it although

it's not that logical and <}> <-> it may </-> <=> <,> it may </=> </}> change
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#104:1:A> Uh <,> the Ministry first gave a mandate to the Writing Committee

saying okay we would like two English courses one for <}> <-> sort of the

</-> <=> <,,> sort of the hoi polloi </=> </}> that have sort of done

something and that's that and ones who are really advanced <,,> and we said

that really won't work because there's a big gap in the middle <,> and

there's maybe something underneath that too
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#105:1:A> Uhh <,> so they said well just make us two courses and we'll see
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#106:1:A> So <}> <-> we </-> <=> we </=> </}> wrote out two courses keeping

a bunch of things in the back of our mind <,> noting there was a hole in the

middle and we kept those things to fill in the hole
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#107:1:A> So the Ministry then says oh my goodness yes you're right we need

three courses
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#108:1:A> <}> <-> So we came up </-> <=> so <,> they came up </=> </}> with

<,> uh the request for three courses
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#109:1:A> Three courses were created one oh one one oh two one oh three
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#110:1:A> Uh and then below this level we said there are a lot of students

that aren't up to the level of one oh one we need another course or we're

going to have <,> fifty percent of the students doing <,,> make-up courses

that won't count <}> <-> for their </-> <=> <,> for their </=> </}> diploma
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#111:1:A> Uh and they said oh my goodness I guess you're right again so

we'll create another course and we have to call it something so the next

number is one oh four and in fact it's lower than one oh one <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#112:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#113:1:A> So the jargon is this is <indig> ensemble un ensemble deux

ensemble trois </indig> <,> for the moment this is called <indig> ensemble

transitoire </indig> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#114:1:A> It may not be as <indig> transitoire </indig> as they thought
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#115:1:A> And this is called <indig> <unclear> word </unclear> &agrave;

<unclear> word </unclear> </indig> <,,> <&> Chalk starts and stops </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#116:1:A> Okay <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#117:1:A> Uh <,,> and as you mentioned <@> Johnny </@> when the students

arrive at the Cegep <,> uh they are tested by whatever <,,> tools people are

using
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#118:1:A> The perfect or imperfect as they are <,> they are in fact tested

<,,> and then students are streamed into <,> one of these four levels or if

they're very weak <,> uh will be <.> s </.> put into a <indig> <unclear> word

</unclear> &agrave; <unclear> word </unclear> </indig> for which they
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#119:1:A> There's a very fine distinction in French <,,> uh <indig> Le cours

accr&eacute;diter n'est pas comptabiliser </indig> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#120:1:A> So they get a credit for it but it doesn't count <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#121:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#122:1:A> The reason they get a credit for it is so that <,> the Cegep has

the money to pay the teachers who teach it <,> uh but they can't count it for

<}> <-> their <,,> their <.> dip </.> </-> <=> their <,,> Cegep diploma </=>

</}> <O> question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-022#123:1:A> Some Cegeps <,> take the placement test and say okay you're

below this level you do the <indig> <unclear> word </unclear> &agrave;

<unclear> word </unclear> </indig> other Cegeps give them a choice hey you

think you can <,> handle the one oh four try it if you fail well take it

again <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#124:1:A> Uhh some of the Cegeps said oh we don't have time to do this we'll

just put them all there sink or swim
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#125:1:A> What's the difference <}> <-> whether they </-> <=> if they </=>

</}> do this and this or this twice
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#126:1:A> Uh and <}> <-> they're </-> <=> <,> one of the effects </=> </}>

of the reform is that the local Cegeps have more <,> autonomy than they've

had in the past <,> and there're a lot of decisions that local Cegeps can

make
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#127:1:A> And if you talk to your friends and you get <}> <-> sorta </-> <+>

sort of </+> </}> five different answers that's quite possible <,> if they're

from five different Cegeps
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#128:1:A> Each administration does have <,> a certain amount of latitude

<,,> <O> question/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-022#129:1:A> Uh our policy is that <}> <-> the <.> s </.> </-> <=> the

teachers </=> </}> have three weeks <,> to <,> do something
<ICE-CAN:S2A-022#130:1:A> Either the student comes and says <,> uh it's too easy it's too

hard or the teacher realizes <,> uh that there's a student here and that they

understand everything and all the jokes so uh they don't really belong here

because those students shouldn't understand a lot </I>
