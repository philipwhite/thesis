<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#1:1> <h> Suppressing Culture </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-010#2:1> Culture functions to establish and uphold the values and norms of

society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#3:1> It is culture which civilizes and suppresses the savage aspect of the

individual to conform with the values prescribed by society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#4:1> However, this value system is heading towards destruction.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#5:1> Culture can no longer conceal the savage instincts of the individual.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#6:1> It is socially situated that we act in a prescribed manner.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#7:1> Society decides what norms and values are acceptable, how people are

to act and feel.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#8:1> Culture is society's way of implementing, imposing, and enforcing

these norms.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#9:1> It conceals the savagery which is part of our societal past and

supresses these instincts to make people civilized.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#10:1> However, by suppressing these savage instincts we are suppressing

part of ourselves and eventually this will lead to the overturning of the

social norms.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#11:1> Joseph Conrad's <ul> Heart of Darkness </ul> and William Butler <w>

Yeats' </w> <ul> The Second Coming </ul> are literary representations of the

self-destructive nature of western society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#12:1> By suppressing our savage instincts we are destroying ourselves.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#13:1> The norms which were established to organize, structure and civilize,

are the corroding forces which will eventually lead to society's downfall.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#14:1> Culture has transformed the individual from savagery to civility and

now society, as a whole, will journey through a heart of darkness, realizing

the effect of this suppression, while moving towards a second coming or

release and return of the savage instincts. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-010#15:1> Society uses culture to control and manipulate individuals into

acting in a prescribed manner.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#16:1> These controlling forces, or norms, are the values strictly upheld by

western society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#17:1> These norms include notions of what people should do, how they should

act, as well as how people should feel.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#18:1> The business class, men, women, and all other members of society are

subject to these norms.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#19:1> However, these social values have only served to suppress the

individual of his or her instinctual drives and desires.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#20:1> Conrad and Yeats both draw attention to the imposing nature of

culture to civilize the individual. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-010#21:1> Conrad extensively uses examples of social norms throughout <ul>

Heart of Darkness </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#22:1> Culture dictates that women are supposed to occupy positions of

inferiority.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#23:1> Women were not supposed to be active, but docile and subservient in

their social station.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#24:1> This subservience is portrayed in the text: <quote> Two women, one

fat and the other slim, sat on straw-bottomed chairs, knitting black wool.

<X> The slim one got up and walked straight at me - still knitting with

downcast eyes - and only just as I began to think of getting out of her way,

as you would for a somnambulist, stood still, and looked up. ( Conrad, 1765)

</X> </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#25:1> Women are sleepwalkers who go through the motions of performing their

assigned roles.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#26:1> There is no real thought involved for culture dictates how to act.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#27:1> The women fulfil only serving positions in which they keep their

culturally assigned roles of domesticity and complacency; they are serving

men but also knitting with their eyes downcast, showing their inferiority.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-010#28:1> These culturally assigned roles do not only apply to women but to

the business class: <quote> When near the buildings I met a white man, in

such an unexpected elegance of get-up that in the first moment I took him for

a sort of vision. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#X29:1> I saw a high starched collar, white cuffs, a light alpaca jacket,

snowy trouser, a clear necktie, and varnished boots.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#X30:1> No hat.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#X31:1> Hair parted, brushed, oiled, under a green-lined parasol held in a

big white hand.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#X32:1> He was amazing, and had a penholder behind his ear. </X> </quote> (

Conrad, 1771)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#33:1> Culture, even in remote Africa, imposes that the accountant be

clean-cut and professional; he is to look and act like a businessman.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#34:1> Culture suppresses the individual to act in ways which are considered

to be civilized and consistent with the values expressed by the society. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-010#35:1> Yeats depicts this suppression with his symbolic representation

of the falcon.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#36:1> The falcon represents the wild and uninhibited nature of society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#37:1> However, culture as the falconer, has served to suppress the society

and controls its actions.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#38:1> Nevertheless, these constraints are overturned and the falcon flies

beyond the range of the falconer ( Yeats, 1880). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-010#39:1> Both Conrad's and <w> Yeats' </w> texts foretell of the downfall

of culture; how social norms will no longer be able to suppress the

individual.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#40:1> It is a shift from civility back to savagery.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#41:1> Conrad expresses the overturning of culture with Marlow's journey

through the heart of darkness where he meets Kurtz.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#42:1> Kurtz is a physical embodiment of society, representative of the

stranglehold culture has on the individual.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#43:1> It is Kurtz who overturns the social norms in favour of his

instinctual drives and desires.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#44:1> Kurtz is sent to Africa to determine how to suppress the African

savages: <quote> All Europe contributed to the making of <}> <-> kurtz </->

<+> Kurtz </+> </}> ; and by and by I learned that, most appropriately, the

International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs had entrusted him

with the making of a report, for its future guidance. </quote> ( Conrad,

1795)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#45:1> However, while travelling through the heart of darkness Kurtz finds a

freedom from the constraints of society and realizes that he is like the

savages he is required to civilize.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#46:1> He finds an affiliation between his inner self and the rites and

rituals of the native peoples; they reawaken his suppressed desires.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#47:1> Kurtz sums up the effect of his, and the natives, suppression when he

cries; <quote> " The Horror! The Horror!" </quote> ( Conrad, 1811).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#48:1> Kurtz realizes that in trying to civilize the African savages western

culture is denying their instinctual nature.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#49:1> If society is to suppress them it might as well; <quote> "

Exterminate all the brutes!" </quote> ( Conrad, 1796), because to civilize

the natives would be denying their drives and desires and, in so doing, would

kill them.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#50:1> Kurtz also realizes that culture has had the same detrimental effect

on society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#51:1> By suppressing our desires we are slowly killing ourselves. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-010#52:1> Marlow, still closely tied to the social norms doesn't seem to

realize the efftecs of suppression and therefore can not understand Kurtz's

horror: <quote> He had summed up - he had judged. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#X53:1> 'The horror!'
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#X54:1> He was a remarkable man.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#X55:1> After all, this was the expression of some sort of belief; it had

candour, it had conviction, it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper,

it had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth - the strange commingling of

desire and hate ... he had made that last stride, he had stepped over the

edge, while I had been permitted to draw back my hesitating foot.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#X56:1> And perhaps in this is the whole difference; perhaps all the wisdom,

and all the truth, and all the sincerity, are just compressed into that

inappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the

invisible. </X> </quote> ( Conrad, 1811-2)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#57:1> However, Marlow does realize that Kurtz has struck upon a truth while

sequestered in the heart of darkness, a place of savagery without the

restraint of culture.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#58:1> Only through his removal from western society does <}> <-> kurtz </->

<+> Kurtz </+> </}> realize how culture has slowly been destroying him, it

has been suppressing his drives and desires. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-010#59:1> Yeats also foretells of the destructive nature of society's

norms: <quote> Things fall apart, the center cannot hold; \ Mere anarchy is

loosed upon the world, \ The blood-dimmed tide is loosed ... </quote> (

Yeats, 1880)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#60:1> Society is suffering a cataclysm at the realization of its

suppression.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#61:1> The norms are falling apart.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#62:1> Culture, the centre, can no longer suppress the savage and therefore

the social norms begin to fall apart.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#63:1> People begin to revolt against their suppressor.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#64:1> This includes the children of society; <quote> " The ceremony of

innocence is drowned" </quote> ( Yeats, 1880).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#65:1> The baptismal nature of passing on society's norms to the children

through socialization and culture, has come to an end.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#66:1> No longer will people teach their children to be civilized but to

follow their instinctual desires.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#67:1> This suppression also causes a complacency; <quote> " The best lack

all conviction, while the worst \ Are full of passionate intensity" </quote>

( Yeats, 1880).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#68:1> Those people who have completely suppressed their savage desires

become complacent.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#69:1> They will follow the social values and are therefore viewed as the

best.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#70:1> The worst are those individuals who have not bowed to the social

norms.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#71:1> They still have a freedom and intensity of drives and desires; a will

other than society's.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#72:1> By realizing how social norms have served to suppress the individual

into civility, the society revolts against the suppressor and again returns

to its savage instincts. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-010#73:1> Culture is facing an overturning.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#74:1> Society will no longer suppress its drives and desires.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#75:1> It is returning to its savage roots.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#76:1> In Conrad's <ul> Heart of Darkness </ul> , Kurtz is the messiah of

this second coming.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#77:1> Kurtz, realizing his suppression, gives over to his savage desires.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#78:1> Marlow, representing civilized western society, sees this as a type

of insanity: <quote> But this must have been before his - let us say - nerves

went wrong, and caused him to preside at certain midnight dances ending with

unspeakable rites, which - as far as I reluctantly gathered from what I heard

at various times - were offered up to him - do you understand? - to Mr. Kurtz

himself. </quote> ( Conrad, 1796)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#79:1> Kurtz finds an affilitaion between his inner self and the rites and

rituals of these native peoples.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#80:1> He, in fact, seems to become their leader, a messiah; instead of

trying to suppress the savages, he joins them. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-010#81:1> Marlow, although he does not give up his civility, begins to see

the effects of suppression when he returns home: <quote> I had a vision of

him on the stretcher, opening his mouth voraciously, as if to devour all the

earth with all its mankind. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#X82:1> He lived then before me; he lived as much as he had ever lived ...
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#X83:1> The vision seemed to enter the house with me ...
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#X84:1> It was a moment of triumph for the wilderness, an invading and

vengeful rush which, it seemed to me, I would have to keep back alone for the

salvation of another soul ... while I waited he seemed to stare at me out of

the glossy panel - stare with that wide and immense stare embracing,

condemning, loathing all the universe.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#X85:1> I seemed to hear the whispered cry, 'The horror! The horror!' </X>

</quote> ( Conrad, 1813-4)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#86:1> Only when he returns to cultured society does Marlow realize how

Kurtz, although believed to be crazy, had struck upon a simple truth.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#87:1> Marlow realizes the constraining effects of culture, yet he

suppresses this knowledge with his other savage instincts.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#88:1> However, this glimpse at the savage changes Marlow: <X> <O> long

passage from text </O> </X>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#89:1> Marlow, realizing he is no longer like the rest of society, as he

perceives his and its suppression, must accept the savage desires which are

inherent within him.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#90:1> He can no longer suppress his savage instincts; yet, instead of

returning to them like Kurtz, he hides his desires in fear of ridicule from

the rest of society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#91:1> Kurtz is able to accept his desires because he is placed in a

surrounding of savagery, whereas Marlow can only choose to forget his desires

because he is surrounded by people following the social norms.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#92:1> However, Marlow looks with contempt on the complacency of the people

who surround him. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-010#93:1> Yeats also seems to see the return of savagery; <quote> " Surely

some revelation is at hand; \ Surely the Second Coming is at hand. <X> \ The

Second Coming!" </X> </quote> ( Yeats, 1881).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#94:1> He foretells of the overturning of civility:
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#95:1> <quote> Hardly are those words out \ When a vast image out of

Spiritus Mundi \ Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert \ A

shape with lion body and the head of a man, \ A gaze blank and pitiless as

the sun, \ Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it \ Reel shadows of

the indignant desert birds. </quote> ( Yeats, 1881)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#96:1> The sphinx is used as a symbol for savagery; a mix of man, the head

and mind, with a lion, a wild beast.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#97:1> The two become intertwined to form one being, dominated by the

savage.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#98:1> The turning of the gyre ( Yeats, 1880), has produced a second coming

of savagery; <quote> " its hour come round at last" </quote> ( Yeats, 1881).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#99:1> Individuals will no longer suppress their drives and desires to

satisfy the social norms. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-010#100:1> Western society is spiralling towards destruction.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#101:1> The catalyst of this destruction is culture.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#102:1> No longer will the savage instincts inherent in society be

suppressed by the social norms.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#103:1> These savage drives and desires are eliminated by imposing culture

to make people civilized and complacent, as seen in Conrad's <ul> Heart of

Darkness </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#104:1> However, these social norms are being overturned, and eliminated in

favour of a return to savagery as in <w> Yeats' </w> <ul> The Second Coming

</ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#105:1> Both of these texts foretell of the revolution from civility and

complacency back to savagery.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#106:1> They sketch a complete overturning of the social norms dictating how

to act and feel, in favour of the savage instinctual nature which drives the

human race.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#107:1> Joseph Conrad's <ul> Heart of Darkness </ul> and William Butler <w>

Yeats' </w> <ul> The Second Coming </ul> are texts which have been culturally

influenced, but function to draw attention to the suppression of the

individual and how the social norms instilled by culture should be overturned

for a return and release of savagery; individuals and society should no

longer be suppressed by their culture. </p> </I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-010#108:2> Gatsby becomes illusioned by his exonerable possessions, he

believes his possessions will get him everything he wants out of life,

including companionship and friendship.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#109:2> Gatsby's lack <}> <-> if </-> <+> of </+> </}> true friends is seen

at his parties, where his fickle guests are either gossiping about each other

or Gatsby himself.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#110:2> The shallowness of his friends is confirmed at his funeral, where

nobody shows up.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-010#111:2> Nick in his attempts to get all of Gatsby's friends together failed

miserably as all of these so called friends said they had prior arrangements
