<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#2:1> <h> Introduction: </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#3:1> <h> An Overview of the Party </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-016#4:1> The roots of the federal New Democratic Party lie in the Great

Depression of the 1930s.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#5:1> In 1932, 131 delegates from a variety of organizations gathered

together in Calgary and decided to form the <quote> 'Co-operative

Commonwealth Federation ( Farmer, Labour, Socialist)' </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#6:1> A year later, the CCF held its first annual convention in Regina and

drafted the Regina Manifesto, a statement of principles that is for many the

touchstone of Canadian socialism.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#7:1> In 1992 the New Democratic Party, the successor to the <smallcaps> CCF

</smallcaps> , celebrates sixty years of <smallcaps> CCF-NDP </smallcaps>

history.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#8:1> Without a doubt, the party can take much pride in its political

accomplishments.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#9:1> But that pride is combined with serious reflec <l> tion and critical

self-appraisal regarding the past, and some concern about the future. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-016#10:1> Is the federal <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps> stalled as a third

party?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#11:1> Has it largely failed in its efforts to be more successful than its

predecessor, the <smallcaps> CCF </smallcaps> ?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#12:1> Why, despite its image repackaging, does the NDP continue to make so

little progress in Quebec?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#13:1> What are the long-term prospects in the industrial heartland of

Ontario?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#14:1> Is the party's provincial base in the west still its main strength?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#15:1> Has the <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps> ceased to provide a clear

socialist alternative to the two old-line parties?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#16:1> Has the <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps> become more a brokerage party

and less an ideologically-based movement?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#17:1> Why, after almost sixty years, has the <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps>

not made greater gains?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#18:1> In providing an overview of the party, particularly during the 1980s,

this chapter will suggest some preliminary answers to these questions, which

will be considered in more detail in later chapters. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#19:1> <h> SUPPORT </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-016#20:1> After reaching its peak at 15.6% in 1945, the federal <smallcaps>

CCF </smallcaps> vote dropped consistently in the four subsequent elections:

to 13.4% in 1949, 11.3% in 1953, 10.7% in 1957, and 9.5% in 1958.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#21:1> Like the Socialist Party of the United States, <fnr> <sp> 1 <sp>

<fnr> the <smallcaps> CCF </smallcaps> was clearly on the path to oblivion.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#22:1> But the birth of the NDP gave new electoral vitality to Canada's

socialist movement.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#23:1> Winning 13.5% of the vote in its maiden election, in 1962, the NDP

did better than had the CCF in all but one of the elections it contested.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#24:1> On average, from 1962 to 1988 the federal <smallcaps> NDP

</smallcaps> has acquired 17.2% of the vote, as compared with 11.1% for the

<smallcaps> CCF </smallcaps> - a clear gain of 6.1%, and a 55% increase over

its forerunner's record.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#25:1> In seven of the ten federal elections since 1962 the <smallcaps> NDP

</smallcaps> has gained a higher percentage of votes than the <smallcaps> CCF

</smallcaps> did even in its best year, 1945. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-016#26:1> Only once, however, has the <smallcaps> CCF-NDP </smallcaps>

received more than 20% of the federal vote: this was in 1988, when the party

exceeded its 26-year average ( 1962-88) in every province or region except

Manitoba and Nova Scotia ( see Appendix Table 1).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#27:1> Although it has increasingly surpassed the 20% barrier in Gallup

polls, <fnr> <sp> 2 <sp> <fnr> it has not yet become a major party on the

brink of power. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-016#28:1> Nor, despite these overall gains, has the <smallcaps> NDP

</smallcaps> 's electoral support shown improvement over the <smallcaps> CCF

</smallcaps> 's in all regions equally.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#29:1> Regionalization between and within parties is a fact of life in

Canadian politics, and the <smallcaps> CCF-NDP </smallcaps> is no exception.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#30:1> When data are compared regarding the average federal vote by province

for the <smallcaps> CCF </smallcaps> and the <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps> (

see Table 1.1), we find that in Saskatchewan support has declined from 34.7%

for the CCF to 32.4% for the NDP.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#31:1> The biggest drop was in the years 1962-65, when the province returned

no NDP MPs - the only period in the combined history of the federal

<smallcaps> CCF-NDP </smallcaps> that this has been so.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#32:1> Several factors offer explanations: ( 1) resentment over the

transformation of the <smallcaps> CCF </smallcaps> into the <smallcaps> NDP

</smallcaps> in the only province where the <smallcaps> CCF </smallcaps> had

formed a government; ( 2) disappointment over T.C. Douglas's departure from

Saskatchewan politics to return to Ottawa; and ( 3) growing disenchantment

with the provincial <smallcaps> CCF </smallcaps> as it neared the end of its

second decade of uninterrupted power. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-016#33:1> In part the <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps> was formed with urban,

labour-oriented Ontario in mind, and it was in that province that its

greatest increase in support occurred: from a 10.7% average for the

<smallcaps> CCF </smallcaps> to a 20.0% average for the <smallcaps> NDP

</smallcaps> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#34:1> The party has seen a virtual doubling of its Ontario vote, a

seven-fold increase in the average number of seats won per election ( from

just over one in the <smallcaps> CCF </smallcaps> era to eight), and an

equally large increase in the percentage of its total seats coming from that

province ( from 7.1% to 31.1%). </p> <O> Table1.1 </O> <O> Table Footnote

</O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-016#35:1> The old <smallcaps> CCF </smallcaps> was an electoral disaster in

Quebec, where it averaged a mere 1.5% of the vote.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#36:1> Some problems were present right from the start.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#37:1> Few Francophones attended the founding convention, and the name Co

<l> operative Commonwealth Federation did not translate well into French.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#38:1> Most of Quebec's Roman Catholic population, and particularly its lead

<l> ership, regarded the party as atheistic, materialistic, and

anti-clerical. <fnr> <sp> 3 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#39:1> In policy, moreover, the <smallcaps> CCF </smallcaps> stressed the

need for a strong federal government and central planning at the expense of

provincial powers and jurisdiction - another point on which most Quebeckers

were espe <l> cially sensitive.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#40:1> Finally, the heavy Anglophone membership of the Quebec <smallcaps>

CCF </smallcaps> reinforced the CCF's image as a party antithetical to French

Canadian interests. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-016#41:1> Another reason for the NDP's creation was to make a new and

better start in Quebec.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#42:1> While no significant breakthrough has yet occurred in a general

election, the <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps> , with an average 8.1% of the

vote, has fared much better than did the <smallcaps> CCF </smallcaps> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#43:1> Overall, the province has given the <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps> its

third-largest increase in votes over the <smallcaps> CCF </smallcaps> , and

the third-highest percentage of the party's total votes ( 12.5%); judging by

the 1988 election, more than one in ten <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps> voters

are now located in Quebec.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#44:1> And if the province has yet to elect a single <smallcaps> NDP MP

</smallcaps> in a general election, the party has on two separate occasions

acquired a solitary Quebec <smallcaps> MP </smallcaps> ; once by means of a

defection from the Conservatives ( Robert Toupin, from 1987 until 1988) and

once, more significantly, through a by-election victory ( Phil Edmonston in

Chambly <O> Table 1.2 </O> <O> Table 1.2 Caption </O> in 1990).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#45:1> Whether these small steps are indicative of potentially greater

future gains for the <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps> in Quebec, particularly

during a general election, remains to be seen. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-016#46:1> That the <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps> has been better able than

the <smallcaps> CCF </smallcaps> to establish a presence in all parts of

Canada can be seen both in the greater percentage of ridings in which it has

run candidates ( 61.3% for the <smallcaps> CCF </smallcaps> vs. 96.0% for the

<smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps> ) <fnr> <sp> 4 </sp> </fnr> and in the fact that

it has increased its vote in almost all regions of Canada ( see Table 1.1).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#47:1> For example, the average percentage vote for the <smallcaps> NDP

</smallcaps> in the province in which its record has been the worst - Prince

Edward Island - is still higher than the CCF's average in several provinces.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-016#48:1> The <smallcaps> CCF </smallcaps> has often been portrayed as a

western protest movement ( e.g., Lipset, 1968: 188).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#49:1> Certainly its leaders came from the west, as did the vast majority of

its MPs ( 89.3%) ( see Table 1.2). <fnr> <sp> 5 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#50:1> However, there has been a ten <l> dency by many to overestimate

western and <quote> 'farmer' </quote> input in the <smallcaps> CCF

</smallcaps> vote while underestimating eastern and <quote> 'labour' </quote>

support.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#51:1> The CCF's elec <l> toral support was greater in the west ( 59.3%),

<fnr> <sp> 6 </sp> </fnr> but not to the degree often assumed ( see Table

1.3): on average, 40.7% of its total votes came from the east. <O> Table 1.3

</O> <O> Table footnote </O> <O> Table 1.3 Caption </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#52:1> Indeed, as early as 1949, twelve years before the <smallcaps> NDP

</smallcaps> 's founding, Ontario provided more of the <smallcaps> CCF

</smallcaps> 's votes than did the Prairies. <fnr> <sp> 7 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-016#53:1> With respect to total votes cast for the <smallcaps> NDP

</smallcaps> , the more populous east ( i.e., Ontario and Quebec), not

surprisingly, accounts for the larger proportion: 60.5%, as compared with

39.6% from the west.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#54:1> Total votes, however, are far from the only criterion.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#55:1> The NDP's representation in Parliament continues to have a western

orientation, with 67.3% of its seats coming from the west.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#56:1> This is a lower rate than in the <smallcaps> CCF </smallcaps> days,

but still somewhat at variance with the party's total votes. <fnr> <sp> 8

</sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#57:1> The 1988 election continued this pattern of asymmetry between total

number of votes and seats.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#58:1> Nevertheless, the imbalance in dis <l> tribution of seats does

reflect the higher average levels of support for the <smallcaps> NDP

</smallcaps> in the west ( X'=25.0% of all votes cast, vs. X'=10.7% for the

east). <fnr> <sp> 9 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#59:1> For example, the 1988 election saw record-high <smallcaps> NDP

</smallcaps> votes in three western provinces: 44.2% in Saskatchewan, 37.0%

in British Columbia, and 17.4% in Alberta. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-016#60:1> In two other important ways the <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps>

retains a very strong western ori <l> entation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#61:1> On the one hand, 1987 data on the 276,128 members of the party

affiliated indirectly through unions <fnr> <sp> 10 <sp> <fnr> ( see Table

1.4) indicate that the east in general and Ontario in particular accounted

for the overwhelming majority ( 79.5% and 76.0% respectively) <O> Table 1.4

</O> <O> Table 1.5 </O> <O> Table footnote </O> <O> Table 1.5 Caption </O> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#62:1> In contrast, 1987 data on direct individual members <fnr> <sp> 11

<sp> <fnr> ( see Table 1.5) reveal that 73.0% of these were found in the

west.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#63:1> To a considerable degree this may reflect the

<NDP's strong provincial bases in this re gion, since federal-party members

are also simul <l> taneously provincial-party members ( except in Quebec from

1989 onwards).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#64:1> Until the 1990 upset victory in Ontario, the only provinces in which

the <smallcaps> CCF-NDP </smallcaps> had formed governments were in the west:

from 1972 to 1975 in British Columbia, from 1944 to 1964 and 1971 to 1982 in

Saskatchewan, from 1969 to 1977 and 1981 to 1988 in Manitoba, and from 1985

to the present in the Yukon.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#65:1> Any decline in the party's provincial for <l> tunes in the west,

therefore, is likely to have an effect upon the federal party's position in

terms of both membership and finances. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-016#66:1> In Saskatchewan the Blakeney <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps>

government had been dramatically defeated in 1982.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#67:1> The party received only 37.2% of the vote, its worst showing in

forty-four years, and went from 44 seats to 8, the most precipi <l> tous drop

ever for the provincial <smallcaps> CCF-NDP </smallcaps> in Saskatchewan (

Fox, 1982: 682-4).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#68:1> Nevertheless, a considerable <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps> base

remained, and in the provin <l> cial election of 1986 the party received

45.2% of the vote, a sizeable increase from 1982.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#69:1> In fact, this was the highest vote for any of the parties - and

higher than in 1975, when the <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps> had formed the

government.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#70:1> But because the electoral system was weighted more heavily to the

less populated rural ridings, the <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps> won only 25

legislative seats ( Fox, 1987: 414-15); the Conservatives, with only 44.6% of

the vote but 38 seats, formed the government and stalled Allan Blakeney's

attempted comeback.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#71:1> It would remain for Roy Romanow, Blakeney's successor in the province

that pioneered Canada's socialist programmes, to return the provincial

<smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps> to power.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#72:1> Certainly the <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps> 's record-high 1988

federal vote in Saskatchewan gave renewed reason for optimism on the eve of

the 1991 provincial election, which was fought on the issues of

privatization, government decentralization ( Pitsula and Rasmussen, 1990),

and the eco <l> nomic plight of Prairie farmers.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#73:1> Romanow was elected Premier with over 50% of the vote and a massive

55 of 66 seats.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#74:1> Saskatchewan was clearly back in the <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps>

fold. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-016#75:1> In British Columbia in the 1980s, the provincial <smallcaps> NDP

</smallcaps> , which had formed the government under Dave Barrett from 1972

to 1975, failed twice to return to power.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#76:1> However, with 44.2% of the vote in 1983, and 42.6% in 1986, down

slightly from its previous high of 45.2% in 1979, the party was still in good

health organizationally, and the record-high vote and seats won in the

province in the 1988 federal election were promising.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#77:1> The ongoing financial scandals of Bill Vander Zalm's Social Credit

government and the lacklustre performance of his successor Rita Johnston

contributed to the collapse of the Social Credit vote in the 1991 provincial

election.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#78:1> While the <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps> vote itself again fell

slightly to 39.8%, it was still sufficient to thwart the resurgent Liberal

Party.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#79:1> The <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps> won 51 seats and provincial leader

Mike Harcourt became Premier of British Columbia. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-016#80:1> The NDP's greatest success stories in the 1980s were its two

provincial victories in Manitoba.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#81:1> Returning to power in 1981, the Manitoba <smallcaps> NDP </smallcaps>

not only won the most seats in its history ( 34), but also received its

highest vote ever ( 47.4%).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-016#82:1> In 1986, despite a decline in its vote to 40.6% ( second place to the

Conservatives), the party retained a slim majority of seats ( 30, to the <w>

Conservatives' </w> 26) and continued, albeit precariously, as the provin <l>

cial government for another two years. </p> </I>
