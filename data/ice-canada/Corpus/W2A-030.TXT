</h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-030#8:1> The diving patterns of 10 adult female California sea lions (

<foreign> <it> Zalophus californianus </it> </foreign> ) were examined during

the summer breeding season on San Miguel Island, California, in 1982 and 1983

using time-depth recorders.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#9:1> During 17 feeding trips, representing 40.6 days at sea, animals made

over 8900 dives, the deepest of which was estimated at 274 m, while the

longest was 9.9 min.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#10:1> The majority of dives, however, were less than 3 min in duration and

80 m in depth.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#11:1> From estimates of body oxygen stores, we predict that dives up to 5.8

min can be supported aerobically.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#12:1> Therefore, cost-benefit considerations based on prey availability and

encounter rate may be more important than physiological limits in shaping the

foraging patterns of <foreign> <it> Zalophus </it> </foreign> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#13:1> Sea lions were active virtually throughout their time at sea, resting

on the surface for only 3% of the average trip.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#14:1> Peak diving frequency occurred during the twilight hours near sunrise

and sunset.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#15:1> Dives were frequent, however, during all hours of the day and were

typically clustered into bouts that lasted a mean ( <w> + <sb> - </sb> </w>

SD) of 3.3 <w> + <sb> - </sb> </w> 1.5 h.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#16:1> We suggest that these bouts represent active feeding on discrete prey

patches.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#17:1> During short bouts ( &lt;3 h), dive depth was less variable than for

dives occurring between bouts.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#18:1> During longer bouts, dive depth changed in a manner consistent with

pursuit of vertically migrating prey.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#19:1> During the 1983 El Ni&ntilde;o, sea lions compensated for a reduction

in food availability by lengthening dive bouts.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#20:1> These seasonal and diel variations in diving patterns suggest that

the rate of prey encounter strongly influences the depth and duration of

individual dives. </p> <O> French Abstract </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#21:1> <h> <bold> Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-030#22:1> Unlike terrestrial predators, the foraging activities of aquatic

mammals take place during breath hold.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#23:1> Feeding depths and time available for search, pursuit, and prey

capture are limited by oxygen stores available upon submergence.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#24:1> These constraints undoubtedly influence the decision rules used by

aquatic predators in locating and pursuing prey.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#25:1> How <l> ever, physiological limits to breath hold may not be the most

important factor shaping the diving patterns of foraging marine mammals.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#26:1> Instead, energetic cost-benefit considera <l> tions based on prey

availability and encounter rates may have a more pronounced effect.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#27:1> Recent data indicate that many fur seal species rarely approach the

calculated limits of dive depth and duration ( Gentry et al. 1986 <it> a

</it> ) .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#28:1> Their dives are normally shallow and of short duration.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#29:1> Consistent, diel variations in dive patterns also suggest that prey

availability and location strongly influence the depth and duration of

individual dives.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#30:1> Within absolute physiological limits, there may be consider <l> able

flexibility in the ways that marine mammals find and pursue prey. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-030#31:1> Theoretical treatments of foraging by terrestrial predators have

described a number of alternative strategies that animals in different

habitats should use to maximize their net rate of energy intake ( Schoener

1971; Pyke et al. 1977; Krebs 1978; Orians and Pearson 1979).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#32:1> For aquatic mammals, however, only Dunstone and O'Connor ( 1979 <it>

a </it> , 1979 <it> b </it> ) have addressed the question of foraging

optimization.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#33:1> They investigated the trade-off between the benefits of continued

search and the cost of losing the prey because of oxygen depletion during

pursuit by the mink ( <foreign> <it> Mustela vison </it> </foreign> ) . <O>

graph </O> <O> graph caption </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#34:1> The results of these studies demonstrated that search and pursuit

times were negatively correlated, but that oxygen limits accounted for

considerably less of the variation in hunting patterns than did optimal forag

<l> ing considerations based on prey encounter rates. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-030#35:1> Empirical evidence of the interactions between marine mammals and

their prey, which might be used to test predic <l> tions of optimal

breath-hold foraging, is lacking.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#36:1> Recent advances in recording instruments, however, now permit the

collection of data on the behavior of foraging animals.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#37:1> As a result, information on several marine mammal and bird spe <l>

cies is now available and provides a basis with which to com <l> pare their

diving and feeding patterns ( Kooyman 1981; Kooyman et al. 1982; Nagy et al.

1984; Croxall et al. 1985; Gentry et al. 1986 <it> a </it> ; Le Boeuf et al.

1988).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#38:1> Constraints imposed by an animal's physiology, morphology, and

habitat and the energetic decision rules common to aquatic predators can be

clarified by these comparisons. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-030#39:1> The California sea lion ( <foreign> <it> Zalophus californianus

</it> </foreign> ) is an ideal subject for studies of diving behavior.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#40:1> Its large size provides an interesting comparison to previous studies

of smaller fur seals ( Gentry et al. 1986 <it> a </it> ) .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#41:1> Like other otariid pinnipeds, sea lions make repeated trips to sea

during the breeding season, returning each time to suckle their pups.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#42:1> This enables the deployment and retrieval of dive recorders.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#43:1> Because they must return with sufficient energy to nourish their pups

during their brief onshore fast, there is no doubt that feeding occurs during

these offshore periods ( Costa 1986). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-030#44:1> In this study, we examined the diving patterns of female sea

lions during these foraging trips.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#45:1> Although no information was obtained on prey availability, inferences

based on optimal foraging predictions were made as to the factors that might

influence the observed behavior.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#46:1> Average dive durations were compared with predicted values to assess

the effects of oxygen limitations on feeding patterns.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#47:1> Comparisons with other spe <l> cies, for which similar data are

available, give insights into the foraging constraints imposed by the

environment and those that reflect functional limits. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#48:1> <h> <bold> Methods </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-030#49:1> This study was conducted at San Miguel Island, California (

34&degree;N; 120&degree;25'W).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#50:1> Time-depth recorders ( TDRs) were deployed on nine lactating, adult

California sea lions between mid-July and mid-August 1982, and on five

animals during mid-July 1983. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-030#51:1> The TDR is a 500-g mechanical device that records, in real time,

the depth and duration of every dive an animal makes over a 2-week period.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#52:1> A complete description of this 5 x 20 cm instrument is given by

Kooyman et al. ( 1983) and Gentry and Kooyman ( 1986).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#53:1> Dives, along with time marks are recorded on photographic film by a

light-emitting diode ( LED) mounted on a movable, pressure sensitive bourdon

tube.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#54:1> Only dives greater than 10 m in depth and 30 s in dura <l> tion can

be resolved.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#55:1> Before deployment and after recovery, all TDRs were calibrated to a

maximum depth of 207 m using a portable pres <l> sure station. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-030#56:1> The appearance of the LED trace can also provide an indirect

measure of activity ( Gentry and Kooyman 1986).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#57:1> Along with dives that appear as pointed traces on the film, the

baseline ( recorded when the animal is on the surface) may be either broad

and wavy, or narrow and flat ( Fig. 1).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#58:1> A broad baseline is caused by movement or chatter of the bourdon tube

arm, and we interpret this trace to indicate sur <l> face swimming.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#59:1> Similarly, we interpret a flat baseline as representing inactivity of

the animal or its resting on the surface.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#60:1> From these images a time budget of the animal's activities at sea can

be con <l> structed ( Fig. 1). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-030#61:1> Sea lions that were observed nursing a pup were captured with

hoop nets and physically immobilized using a large restraint board with a

detachable neck brace ( Gentry and Holt 1982).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#62:1> TDRs were fastened to each animal with a harness constructed from

straps of 2.5 cm wide tubular nylon webbing ( Gentry and Kooyman 1986).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#63:1> A very high frequency ( VHF) radio transmitter ( 5 cm length x 2 cm

diameter; Advanced Telemetry Systems) was also attached to the har <l> ness

to facilitate locating the animal on shore.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#64:1> When animals returned from sea they were recaptured, the TDR removed,

and the animal released. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#65:1> <h> <it> Analysis </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-030#66:1> Upon recovery, the film was developed and enlarged.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#67:1> Dive traces and timing marks were digitized and printouts obtained of

the time each dive occurred, its depth, duration, and length of the following

surface interval ( Gentry and Kooyman 1986).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#68:1> During analysis, it became clear that dives occurred in clusters,

separated by compara <l> tively long surface intervals.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#69:1> To analyze these dive bouts, we estab <l> lished their ending points

in time using a bout-ending criterion ( BEC) that was determined by

constructing surface interval - survivorship curves ( Gentry and Kooyman

1986).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#70:1> For each animal, the number of post-dive surface intervals with a

duration greater than a given time <it> t </it> was plotted logarithmically

against <it> t </it> on the ordinate ( Fig. 2).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#71:1> This formed a decreasing function with a slope proportional to the

probability of a surface interval of given duration occurring at any time

after the last surface interval recorded ( Fagen and Young 1978).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#72:1> A break in the slope, therefore, signifies a change in the

probability of surface interval occurrence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-030#73:1> For each animal two inflection points were observed: one at 2 to

3 min and the other between 7 and 11 min ( Fig. 2).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#74:1> Following the procedures outlined in Gentry and Kooyman ( 1986), the

second point was chosen to represent the BEC.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#75:1> To further define a bout, the mini <l> mum number of dives was

arbitrarily set at 10.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#76:1> A dive bout, there <l> fore, consisted of 10 or more dives not

separated by a surface period exceeding the BEC. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-030#77:1> Dive bouts were analyzed separately for mean dive depth,

duration, and surface interval length.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#78:1> Interbout intervals were calculated as time from the last dive in a

bout until the first dive of the next.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#79:1> Transit times to and from the feeding grounds were established by

calculating the time from shore departure to the first dive bout and that

spent in returning to land from the last dive bout. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-030#80:1> Activity budgets were constructed from records with clear swim

<l> ming and resting traces.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#81:1> Time spent swimming was determined as all surface activity excluding

resting and time spent on the surface between dives occurring within bouts.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#82:1> During a dive bout, surface intervals between dives were generally

brief and likely did not indi <l> cate travel, but instead were associated

with replenishing 0 <sb> 2 </sb> stores.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#83:1> Time spent diving was calculated as the total time that the animal

was submerged.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#84:1> Sea lions were considered resting when the dive trace appeared flat (

Fig. 1). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-030#85:1> To calculate distance travelled from the amount of time spent

swimming, estimates were made of both swim speed and the instru <l> ment's

hydrodynamic impact ( Appendix).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#86:1> These calculations indicate that adult sea lions should travel at an

average velocity of 2.5 m/s ( 9 km/h) when carrying the TDR package.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#87:1> Empirical data collected on other otariid species of differing body

size, however, suggest that this value may be slightly high owing to the

assumption of similar relative transport costs between juveniles and adults (

P. J. Ponganis, personal communication).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#88:1> The average velocity of 9 km/h should therefore be viewed as

approximate and the calculated foraging ranges regarded as maximum estimates.

</p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#89:1> <h> <bold> Results </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-030#90:1> In 1982, all nine animals returned to shore with the instru <l>

ment package.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#91:1> One TDR failed, so that eight diving records were obtained ( ZC-5

through ZC-12).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#92:1> In 1983, only two of the five animals returned to the study site (

ZC-17 and ZC-20).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#93:1> A total of 10 dive records was therefore obtained from individual

animals.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#94:1> Because several of the animals made more than one trip to sea prior

to recapture, a total of 17 feeding trips was recorded ( Table 1).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#95:1> On 6 of these, film in the TDR ran out while the animal was still at

sea.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#96:1> On 11 of the trips, the return to shore was recorded. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-030#97:1> Since all animals carried radio tags, it was possible to tell

when they returned to San Miguel Island.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#98:1> However, records clearly showed that two animals ( ZC-10 and ZC-17)

were on land for periods ranging from 12 to 33 h although they did not return

to the study site.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#99:1> Nevertheless, because offshore rocks and other islands occur near San

Miguel, these onshore periods are taken to represent the end of a trip to

sea. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#100:1> <h> <it> Performance </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-030#101:1> Over 8900 dives were logged in 40.6 recorded days at sea.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-030#102:1> The trace of the deepest dive, although completely recorded on the

film, exceeded the calibration of the instrument and was estimated at 274 m (

ZC-9; Table 1) by assuming a linear correlation between pressure and the

distance travelled by the recording arm. <O> diagram </O> <O> diagram caption
