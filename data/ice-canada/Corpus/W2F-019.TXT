<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X3:1> <quote> <it> It is the question the writer asks when writing a

book: Shall I fill in all the details?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X4:1> Or shall I let the reader imagine them all?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X5:1> &dotted-line; What if I give you dots and numbers and you draw in the

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#8:1> On the dining room table in my <w> parents' </w> house, there is a

shallow crystal bowl filled with 10 ceramic balls.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#9:1> They are like billiard balls without the weight, Christmas baubles

without the hooks.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#10:1> They are perfect and useless, bright globes of pure colour.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#11:1> I am forbidden to touch them and, being a good girl, I don't.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#12:1> Only my mother handles them.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#13:1> I suppose my father could too if he wanted but he doesn't.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#14:1> Once a week my mother removes the balls one by one from the bowl and

polishes them with a soft rag, a piece of my old nightie with ducks and bun

<l> nies on it.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#15:1> She lines the polished balls up like beads at the edge of the table

against the wall.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#16:1> They make my heart ache.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#17:1> Occasionally she lets me hold one: the red one, the green one, just

for a minute now, the blue one is my favourite, be careful.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#18:1> This is how I know the balls are nearly weightless.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#19:1> Occasionally I imagine smashing them one by one against the wall.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#20:1> More often I imagine juggling them in slow motion, a luminous halo of

colours suspended over my head. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#21:1> In 1989, Anthony Gatto of the United States juggled 5 clubs with

<l> out a drop for 45 minutes and 2 seconds.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#22:1> That same year, Jas Angelo of Great Britain juggled 3 objects without

a drop for 8 hours, 57 minutes and 31 seconds.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#23:1> In 1990, in Seattle, Washington, 821 jugglers kept 2,463 objects in

the air simultane <l> ously.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#24:1> Each person juggled at least 3 objects.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#25:1> The nature of these objects is not noted, nor how high or how long

they were airborne. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#26:1> I try to learn how to juggle from a book but I can't get the hang

of it.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#27:1> I take up baton twirling instead. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#28:1> <h> <bold> 2 </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#29:1> When my mother is happy, she bakes.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#30:1> She gets up before my father and me and ties an apron over her

nightgown.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#31:1> She rattles and hums in the warm yellow kitchen while it's still dark

outside.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#32:1> If I get up early enough, she lets me measure the flour, the butter,

the brown sugar which must be tightly packed into the measuring cup.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#33:1> If I sleep later, entering the dining room is like coming downstairs

on Christmas morning.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#34:1> The bowl of ceramic balls on the perfectly polished table is

surrounded by hot pies with flaky lattice crusts and multi-layered cakes with

white or chocolate icing in delicate swirls on top.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#35:1> Sometimes I am allowed to have a piece of cake or pie after

breakfast.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#36:1> All morning at school I walk around with the weight of it in the

bottom of my stomach, the taste of it still sweet on the back of my tongue.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#37:1> The largest apple pie ever baked was made by Chef Glynn Christian

in a 40 <typeface> X </typeface> 23 foot dish in Chelsfield, Great Britain,

in August 1982.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#38:1> The pie weighed 30,115 pounds and was cut by Rear-Admiral Sir John

Woodward.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#39:1> The largest cake ever baked weighed 128,238 pounds and 8 ounces,

including 16,209 pounds of icing.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#40:1> Created in the shape of the state of Alabama, the cake was made to

celebrate the centenary of Fort Payne.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#41:1> Prepared by a local bakery called Earth Grains, it was cut by

100-year-old resident Ed Henderson on 18 October 1989.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#42:1> The flavour of the cake is not noted, nor how much longer Ed

Henderson lived. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#43:1> When my mother is unhappy, we go without dessert.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#44:1> But even when she is in her bedroom crying with the door shut, the

rest of the house is still filled with the fragrance of her baking, and my

father is still smiling.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#45:1> On my birthday, whether my mother is happy or not, she bakes me a

special chocolate cake with nickels in it. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#46:1> <h> <bold> 3 </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#47:1> My diary is a small pink book with gilt-edged pages and a tiny

gold lock and key.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#48:1> In it, I am allotted one page per day, one tissue-thin page covered

with fine blue lines.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#49:1> No matter what does or doesn't happen on any given day, I feel

obliged to fill each page.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#50:1> I briefly note the events of home and school: The math test was hard.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#51:1> My mother made me clean my room.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#52:1> My true love kissed me after school behind the little <w> kids' </w>

slide. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#53:1> On boring days, I pay cursory attention to world events: Canada

celebrates its centennial.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#54:1> The world's first successful heart trans <l> plant is performed in

South Africa.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#55:1> Martin Luther King, Jr, is shot and killed in Memphis.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#56:1> Robert Kennedy is shot and killed in Los Angeles.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#57:1> Jackie Kennedy marries Aristotle Onassis.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#58:1> The <smallcaps> us </smallcaps> death toll in Vietnam passes 30,000.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#59:1> Mostly, though, I write about the future.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#60:1> I describe in detail the man I will marry.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#61:1> I choose names for our 3 perfect children and our dog.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#62:1> Sometimes I draw pictures of the house we will live in, the car we

will drive, the dress I will wear on our wedding day.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#63:1> If the present is frequently confusing, at least the future and the

exquis <l> ite weight of its abundant possibilities are always clear.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#64:1> Even from this distance, I can see the colour of his eyes, the smile

on my lips, the never-ending song in my heart. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#65:1> The largest mirage ever recorded was sighted in the Arctic at

83&degree;N 103&degree;W by Donald B. Macmillan in 1913.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#66:1> It included hills, val <l> leys, and snow-capped peaks extending

through at least 120&degree; of the horizon.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#67:1> It was the type of mirage known as the <foreign> <mention> " Fata

Morgana," </mention> </foreign> so called because such visions were formerly

believed to be the nasty work of Morgan le Fay, King Arthur's evil fairy

half-sister.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#68:1> The tech <l> nique used to measure and record a mirage is not

described. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#69:1> I have all the confidence in the world.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#70:1> I wear the key to my diary on a chain around my neck like a locket.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#71:1> Being a good girl, I natu <l> rally assume that I will eventually be

the recipient of an appropri <l> ate measure of eternal happiness.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#72:1> The future will be my just reward. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#73:1> <h> <bold> 4 </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#74:1> I fall in love every time I turn around.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#75:1> I am supposed to be study <l> ing Philosophy and the great works of

Literature, but I am drinking cof <l> fee in the university cafeteria and

falling in love instead.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#76:1> Even Plato had a theory of desire.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#77:1> I am always ready to be swept off my feet, even when I'm sitting

down.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#78:1> I fall in love with a wrist on a table, a thigh in blue denim, a lock

of black hair, the tickle of a moustache, the tender angle of a manly neck

bent towards me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#79:1> I pick up the electricity in the air, the force fields of handsome

men who mill around me, until my stomach feels charred and my hands are shak

<l> ing.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#80:1> This could be from all that caffeine, but I take it to be another

symptom of love. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#81:1> The only person in the world to be struck by lightning 7 times

was ex-park ranger Roy C. Sullivan of Virginia, <smallcaps> usa </smallcaps> .
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#82:1> His attraction for lightning began when he was struck in 1942 and

lost his big toenail.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#83:1> In July 1969 he lost his eyebrows.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#84:1> In July 1970 his left shoulder was seared.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#85:1> In April 1972 his hair was set on fire.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#86:1> In August 1973 his hair was set on fire again, and his legs were

seared.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#87:1> In June 1976 his ankle was injured.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#88:1> In June 1977, struck while fish <l> ing, he suffered burns to his

stomach and chest.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#89:1> In September 1983 he died by his own hand, reportedly after being

rejected by the woman he loved.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#90:1> The method of Roy Sullivan's suicide is not noted. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#91:1> My best friend tells me I'm addicted to love.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#92:1> I say, At least it's more harmless than heroin.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#93:1> She says, Are you sure? </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#94:1> <h> 5 </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#95:1> The men I love don't love me back.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#96:1> I sleep with them anyway.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#97:1> The men I don't love call me in the middle of the night, crying or

cursing because I won't sleep with them.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#98:1> I feel like I'm banging my head against a wall, one of those stucco

walls with bits of coloured ground glass embedded in it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#99:1> The beak of the red-headed woodpecker, <foreign> <it> Melanerpes

erythro <l> cephalus </it> </foreign> , hits the bark of a tree with an

impact velocity of 13 mph.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#100:1> This means that when the head snaps back, the brain is subject to a

deceleration of approximately 10 g.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#101:1> The type of tree is not noted, nor the possible long-term effects of

this activity. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#102:1> I decide I will marry the next man who asks me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#103:1> In the mean <l> time, I try on the notion of celibacy the way other

women try on a new coat.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#104:1> It doesn't fit.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#105:1> I try learning to live without desire, but I can't get the hang of

it.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#106:1> Years pass. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#107:1> <h> <bold> 6 </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#108:1> My husband is a poet.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#109:1> His poetry is epic, anguished, and rhyming.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#110:1> Although no one will publish his work, he refuses to compromise his

artistic integrity by catering to the mar <l> ketplace.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#111:1> He is sure he will be famous someday, perhaps posthu <l> mously.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#112:1> In the meantime, he drives a taxi to pay the bills.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#113:1> He also spends a lot of time lying on the couch watching <smallcaps>

tv </smallcaps> , eating potato chips, and thinking great thoughts.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#114:1> He hasn't written a poem in 6 months.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#115:1> In that time he has gained 10 pounds from all those chips, and I

have gained 20 because I am pregnant.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#116:1> His depression grows in direct proportion to the size of my belly.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#117:1> He eats more chips and changes the channel.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#118:1> His shirt is covered with crumbs.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#119:1> At least he's dressed.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#120:1> The living room is filled with his misery.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#121:1> I read baby name books in the kitchen.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#122:1> Sometimes I think that the couch with the weight of him and his

depression on it will eventually crash through the floor and plummet directly

to the centre of the earth. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#123:1> The deepest depression so far discovered is the bedrock of the

Bentley Subglacial Trench in Antarctica at 8,326 feet below sea level.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#124:1> The greatest submarine depression is an area of the Northwest

Pacific floor that has an average depth of 15,000 feet.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#125:1> The deepest exposed depression on land is the shore surrounding the

Dead Sea, now 1,310 feet below sea level.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#126:1> The rate of fall in the lake surface has been 13 3/4 inches per year

since 1948. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#127:1> My husband says he cannot possibly be a poet and a parent at the

same time.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#128:1> He reads Paradise Lost and sometimes speaks in iambic pentameter.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#129:1> I borrow books on childbirth and breastfeeding from the library.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#130:1> I go to prenatal classes and practise the breathing alone. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#131:1> <h> <bold> 7 </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#132:1> We talk and we talk and we talk.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#133:1> We cry.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#134:1> He makes up his mind and then changes it hack again.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#135:1> Finally he goes out, ostensibly to buy a bag of chips.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#136:1> He returns an hour later with a 3-piece set of matching luggage,

soft-sided in royal blue with locks and tiny keys like the one I had for my

diary in Grade 8.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#137:1> He fills the biggest suitcase with books.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#138:1> It is so heavy he cannot lift it.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#139:1> He rearranges the contents of the suitcases to achieve a more even

distribution of weight.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#140:1> He sets them in the back porch and calls a taxi.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#141:1> He kisses me goodbye.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#142:1> We do not discuss where he is going.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#143:1> We are all talked out. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#144:1> In 1988, students at University College, Dublin, debated the

notion that <mention> " Every Dog Should Have Its Day" </mention> for 503

hours and 45 minutes.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#145:1> This record was broken in April 1992 by students at St Andrews

Presbyterian College in Laurinburg, North Carolina, who debated the idea that

<mention> " There's No Place Like Home" </mention> for 517 hours and 45

minutes.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#146:1> The winners of these debates are not noted. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#147:1> My daughter is born 12 days later. </p> </I>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#148:1> I am in labour for 18 hours and 45 minutes, with my best friend as

my coach.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#149:1> My daughter weighs 7 pounds, 6 1/2 ounces and is 20 inches long.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#150:1> I should be afraid, but I'm not. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#151:1> <h> <bold> 8 </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-019#152:1> My best friend and I find baby sitters so we can go downtown on

Friday night.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#153:1> We are giddy with freedom while our beautiful babies sleep.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#154:1> We cruise the shiny streets arm-in-arm laughing with our heads

thrown back. </I> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X155:1> We go inside and stand at the bar.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X156:1> We order scotch and water which after 3 sips tastes like apple

juice to me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X157:1> We flirt with two young men in tight jeans and ban <l> dannas.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X158:1> They wear silk vests with nothing underneath.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X159:1> Their pec <l> torals are hairless, shiny and distinct.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X160:1> We flick our long hair, our slim hips, our little pointy tongues.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X161:1> We tell them we are tourists.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X162:1> When they become obnoxious, we hold hands and tell them we are gay.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X163:1> We do not tell them we are mothers in disguise.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X164:1> We tease them till they sulk.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X165:1> We snort and snicker and order more scotch.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X166:1> We speculate as to the exact nature of the male ego, this allegedly

nat <l> ural phenomenon which gets so much attention.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X167:1> Where is it located?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X168:1> In the head, the heart, the penis?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X169:1> What colour is it?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X170:1> Blood red, royal blue, deep purple, black?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-019#X171:1> How big is it really, this marvel <l> lous chimera which we have

spent so much of our lives tending to, massaging, tippy-toeing around? </p>

</X>
