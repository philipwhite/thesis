<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-042#1:1:A> The Oxford dictionary speaks of illustrious warriors <,> of men

admired for their achievements and noble qualities <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#2:1:A> Searching for a female-centred definition I turned to Vogue magazine

<,,> <O> crowd laugher </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#3:1:A> I always tell my students I read Vogue for the articles <,,> <O>

crowd laugher </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#4:1:A> In any event <,> Vogue magazine described heroines as infinitely

alluring a shade tragic <,> <O> crowd laugher </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#5:1:A> Damsels in distress locked in castle turrets loom immediately before

your eyes
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#6:1:A> I was rescued somewhat by the publication of feminist dictionaries

over the last several years and the several that I cited poke fun <,> at

<mention> hero </mention>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#7:1:A> My favourite was a recitation from Charlotte Perkins Gilman who was

a very famous American <,> feminist at the turn of the century who wrote as

follows
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#8:1:A> This is her definition of <mention> hero </mention>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#9:1:A> <O> quotation </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#10:1:A> And I realized why we elected Brian Mulroney <&> Canadian Prime

Minister </&> <,,> <O> crowd laugher </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#11:1:A> Now <O> cough </O> <,> what's most interesting to me about the

feminist dictionary is that it contained no entry for <mention> heroine

</mention> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#12:1:A> Presumably some feminists have concluded that the female

counterpart of this <mention> hero </mention> is unsalvageable that it is

seriously infected with saccharine femininity race and class privilege and

the glorification of characteristics prized by men
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#13:1:A> With this perspective I sympathize <,> but I <}> <-> respect </->

<=> respectfully </=> </}> wish to disagree
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#14:1:A> I have always been partial to the reclamation of words and I think

there is room to rehabilitate the word <mention> heroine </mention> <?>

altered </?> to give new meaning and dimension to the concept
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#15:1:A> It is not beyond the realm of possibility to believe that the

feminist movement could forge an entirely new definition for <mention>

heroine </mention> <,> one much richer fuller <,> and more reflective of the

diversity of women's lives
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#16:1:A> I think we need to grope toward something which will capture the

lives of women who represent strength <,> courage <,> persistence <,>

fortitude <,> all of those <,> in the face of oppression
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#17:1:A> And I think there're two main premises behind the reclamation task
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#18:1:A> Let me just write this
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#19:1:A> I know you need a focal point <?> at this point </?> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#20:1:A> The first direction we have to move <,,> <&> sound of writing on a

blackboard </&> is the concept of inclusivity
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#21:1:A> Our understanding of the levels of oppression have to be as

inclusive as possible so that we ensure that race class and sexual

orientation and so on are considered <,> as well as gender
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#22:1:A> Secondly <,,> <&> sound of writing on a blackboard </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#23:1:A> Secondly I think we have to <,> grapple with the male traditions

which tout heroes as role models and as perfect
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#24:1:A> I think we have to move beyond perfection <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#25:1:A> And I think we need to ask ourselves is perfection what feminists

want to demand of their foresisters
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#26:1:A> Is perfection a necessary ingredient of female heroism <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#27:1:A> Let me start with the first inclusivity <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#28:1:A> Much of our current feminist historical scholarship <,> has focused

upon white well-educated middle and upper class Protestant women
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#29:1:A> For this I have to claim I share some responsibility
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#30:1:A> I'm clearly implicated in terms of the women that I began choosing

to study
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#31:1:A> In my defence and the defence of the rest of us I can say that

their records tend to be more accessible and their achievements have tended

to reflect in some measure the criteria that wider society has viewed as

heroic <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#32:1:A> But it seems to me that the search for women who represent strength

and courage and persistence and fortitude in the face of oppression should be

much wider <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#33:1:A> And the realization of this was painfully brought home to me <,>

when I <,> began working on my manuscript <,> which will be appearing this

Spring titled Petticoats and Prejudice
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#34:1:A> I know this is the second time the title's been mentioned
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#35:1:A> I'm shamelessly flaunting <,> my book <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#36:1:A> This is based on about a decade's worth of research I've done on

nineteenth century legal records
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#37:1:A> And they reveal a remarkably diverse bunch of women <,> improperly

married wives victims of seduction and rape perpetrators of infanticide and

abortion practising prostitutes <,> petitioners for divorce and child custody

and wage labourers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#38:1:A> None of these women are warriors active in military manoeuvres
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#39:1:A> Furthermore the admiration they achieved from a paternalistic

society was grudgingly qualified at best <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#40:1:A> Nor were they fainting damsels <,> rescued by handsome knights <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#41:1:A> And yet there's undeniable heroism in the lives of women such as

the following
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#42:1:A> Ellen Rogers was a francophone rape victim who demanded that women

of all classes and sexual background should be protected from sexual assault
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#43:1:A> She spoke those words through tears <,> in a Toronto courtroom in

eighteen fifty-nine to a courtroom filled with jeering and abusive public

members who were laughing and shouting as her gang rapists were acquitted

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#44:1:A> <?> Esther R Scott </?> was an English prostitute who ran a

notorious brothel in London Ontario in the eighteen eighties
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#45:1:A> The Crown Attorney and the Mayor of London decided to conduct a

legal vendetta against her to make an example of her
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#46:1:A> She hired
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#47:1:A> She was a well-to-do brothel operator
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#48:1:A> She hired the leading criminal lawyers in the country <,> a raft of

them
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#49:1:A> About four by the time she finished
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#50:1:A> And she fought them at every turn of the way
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#51:1:A> And when she achieved success in her criminal <,> case she turned

around and authorized her lawyers to sue the Crown Attorney and Mayor of

London for compensation for false imprisonment
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#52:1:A> She won <,> at the first level of hearings
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#53:1:A> Subsequently the ruling was overturned but before they could catch

up with her to jail her <,,> she had fled to the United States
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#54:1:A> And she returned to London approximately a decade later flush with

prosperity <,> with a new husband in tow who was described as a horse breeder

and horse dealer to live out her life in financial security and middle class

respectability in London Ontario <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#55:1:A> Euphemia Rabbit was a woman <,> from the First Nations who also had

Italian ancestry who shot and killed her would-be rapist at Slate Creek

British Columbia <,> in eighteen ninety-seven and she successfully argued

self-defence at her murder trial <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#56:1:A> Anna <?> Ballo </?> a Finnish immigrant committed infanticide in

Nanaimo in eighteen ninety-six in the face of stark poverty and social

ostracism and then withstood the dramatic legal intervention into her life

with stoicism and fortitude <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#57:1:A> Nellie Armstrong was a feisty smart-mouthed hot-tempered New

Brunswicker who fought unsuccessfully in eighteen ninety-five to wrest

custody of her four year old daughter and two year old son from a violent

husband
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#58:1:A> These women and others are ones whose histories should also be

reclaimed and who also deserve the accolation <mention> heroine </mention>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#59:1:A> Next moving to perfection beyond perfection
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#60:1:A> <}> <-> Male heroes </-> <=> <,> Male heroes </=> </}> have

traditionally been catapulted into service for furnishing role models for the

current generation and women have borrowed this pattern and heroines have

been forced into moulds as gurus touted as unblemished symbols of wisdom

insight and inspiration
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#61:1:A> My colleague Rob Martin has charged me with inculcating adulation

of Clara Brett Martin publicly
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#62:1:A> I think fairly in some measure
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#63:1:A> Fairly <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#64:1:A> And I think the time is overdue for us to re-examine the search for

perfection and consider whether it is essential or fundamental to our

emerging new concept of heroine
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#65:1:A> These women did not ask to become our shining knights in armour <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#66:1:A> Most of them would be horrified to know to what degree their

thoughts and deeds would be scrutinized by future generations
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#67:1:A> Out of a feminist sense of charity perhaps we ought not to require

women of the past to bear responsibility of icons of the future a role they

never sought <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#68:1:A> Femininism might want to work towards embodying a more humble sense

of human error <,> a more grounded set of expectations about human failings

and deficiencies
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#69:1:A> We come by this naturally
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#70:1:A> No one who has worked within the feminist movement for any length

of time can claim innocence on this score <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#71:1:A> One of the gravest tasks facing our society today is to work

towards an elimination of continuing and vicious anti-Semitism racism ableism

and other forms of discrimination <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#72:1:A> One of the chief barriers <,> is the inability of members of the

privileged groups in our society to admit their complicity
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#73:1:A> The knee-jerk reactions of defensiveness which sprouts almost

immediately upon any assertion of sexism and racism is eloquent testimony to

our wish to erase even the most polite dialogue <,> on these issues <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#74:1:A> One way we might speed the work against these barriers is to look

to our past <,> to dissect the racism sexism and other forms of

discrimination of our ancestors <,> to do this honestly and without

attempting to distance ourselves artificially from their errors <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#75:1:A> Clara Brett Martin's failure to make feminism inclusive of all

women's interests is centrally important to any full analysis of her place in

history
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#76:1:A> I think we can learn from her errors because in so many ways her

errors are our errors <,> and this whole debate is about ourselves and the

future
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#77:1:A> We can use the revelations about Clara Brett Martin's anti-Semitism

as a spur to produce more research on the history of anti-Semitism and its

current manifestations on our profession and society
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#78:1:A> We can make Clara Brett Martin's mistakes work to our heightened

appreciation of justice fairness and equality
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#79:1:A> We can turn her lack of insight into a mechanism for remedial

action today
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#80:1:A> Clara Brett Martin's principles and actions were marred by bigotry

and limited perspective but she did fight against some forms of male

injustice
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#81:1:A> She challenged a part of the patriarchal system and she paid

personally for her daring
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#82:1:A> Demanding that she be perfect <,> that she have understood every

aspect of bigotry and injustice is to hold her to a model which will be met

by very few <,> perhaps none <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#83:1:A> That vision of heroine as perfect and omniscient is binding

restrictive and remarkably rigid
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#84:1:A> If we hold to it <,> we will consign ourselves to a future in which

historians will write of theory <,> and institutions <,> but not of people
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#85:1:A> I for one would rather historians continue to write about

individual women <,> detailing at length their shortcomings and yet according

them the respect of recognizing that at points there were bonds of shared

sisterhood
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#86:1:A> Clara Brett Martin is revealed <}> <-> as a women </-> <=> as a

woman </=> </}> with significant gaps in her understanding of injustice and

discrimination
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#87:1:A> I think we need to ask ourselves whether there is still room for

her within this evolving rehabilitated concept of <mention> heroine

</mention>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#88:1:A> And I want to close with a poem by Adrienne Rich <,> called A Wild

Patience Has Taken Me This Far
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#89:1:A> <O> quotation </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#90:1:A> Thank you <&> applause </&> </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-042#91:2:A> A friend of mine returned from the <unclear> two words

</unclear> describing this bizarre geography book called Gender and Sexuality
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#92:2:A> After tracking down and reading Peter Jackson's Maps of Meaning I

realized that it is an unusual book because it stretches the traditional

boundaries of the discipline of geography <unclear> word </unclear> inclusion

of issues <?> of class </?> race and gender <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#93:2:A> I mean what can possibly be <}> <-> <.> geograph </.> </-> <=>

geographical </=> </}> about such intimate personal subjects as gender and

sexuality <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#94:2:A> As a feminist and as a new Geography P H D student I was

immediately intrigued by the potential of the common terrain between feminism

and Geography <,> but when I <?> tried <?> to investigate <unclear> word

</unclear> <?> field <?> it proved to be <?> problematic </?> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#95:2:A> <?> Whether </?> discussed in mainstream geography journals or in

traditional geographic circles I soon discovered that feminist geography is

marginalized and obscure little known by geographers and even less known by

feminists
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#96:2:A> In this paper I will briefly review the study of women in geography

and gender and I will explore some reasons behind the neglect of this

important body of work by mainstream geography <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#97:2:A> This question of <?> geography's <?> <unclear> word </unclear> <?>

feminists is </?> important because as <@> Marianne Withers </@> argues

<quote> when <unclear> word </unclear> the explicit study of the geography of

</quote> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#98:2:A> Women were <unclear> word </unclear> from Geography up until very

recent times
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#99:2:A> It was only in the mid-nineteen seventies in Britain and in the

United States <,> that a small group of not surprisingly female geographers

became concerned with the neglect of <?> women in the discipline </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#100:2:A> They set themselves the monstrous task of <}> <-> retrieving </->

believed that the study of women's lives and spatial behaviour was of equal

importance to the study of men's <,> and that the distinctiveness <unclear>

two or three words </unclear> of women's experiences should be recognized

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#101:2:A> This original research which focused exclusively on <?> how women

women <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-042#102:2:A> It directly challenged traditional <}> <-> <.> geo </.> </-> <=>
