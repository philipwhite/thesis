<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#2:1> Action-Prevention Valcartier held its first meeting on March 18

and attracted over 70 citizens, as well as the mayor of Valcartier and some

of its councillors, including Ludwig Fitzpatrick, council liaison with the

crime prevention group. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#3:1> Two representatives from Astronicor, an alarm company, also

attended to talk about their products. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#4:1> Co-ordinator Tim Brown says that since the meeting, the mail box

set up to receive anonymous tips on crimes committed has already received

important information. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#5:1> The committee now has a permanent office at 1745 Val <l> cartier

Boulevard; its telephone number is 844-2097. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#6:1> Brown reminds Valcartier residents that if they have a break-in or

are otherwise the victims of crime, they should first phone the

S&ucircumflex;ret&eacute;, then notify the Action-Prevention office. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#7:1> Three police officers who live in Valcartier are also working with

the committee. </p> </I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#10:2> Brulart Avenue, Sillery; Paddy's Day plus two; 6 a.m. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#11:2> In company with a black Labrador retriever named Kaska, I'm

passing Jim and Pat Scott's demesne - but they don't figure in this story;

they're not up yet. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#12:2> Modern technology has just enlivened my stroll with a delightful

program of classical music over Radio-Canada, and now, through the earphones

of my Walkman, comes the voice of Radio-Canada newsman Raymond Archambault.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#13:2> So what's the world been up to without my permission? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#14:2> Two items, almost back-to-back, catch my attention and conspire

to do something nasty to my blood pressure. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#15:2> Treasury Board President Daniel Johnson is expected to make a

statement to the effect that as of January 1991, salaries of all Quebec civil

servants will be frozen.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#16:2> And in virtually the same breath, my friend of the early morning

airwaves goes on to talk about something members of the Senate have been

debating for a while. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#17:2> Something like an allowance of &dollar;153 per senator for each

sitting he or she attends.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#18:2> Tidy sum just for reporting for work, no? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#19:2> That's on top of an annual salary of &dollar;65,000 plus, and

entertainment allowance of some thousands.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#20:2> And <it> that's </it> just the icing.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#21:2> We know all about the cake, don't we? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#22:2> While the civil servants both in Quebec City and in Ottawa will

see their salaries stagnate for a season, out of respect for the " present

economic situation". </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#23:2> Ain't it ever thus?
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#24:2> Always the civil servants!
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#25:2> Oh, the urge to wax cynical - but first, to repeal the libel laws!

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#26:2> Takes me back to the early <w> ' 80s </w> : in one breath the

members of the Quebec legislature voted to cut the salaries of Quebec civil

servants; in the next they voted themselves a healthy increase. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#27:2> Ah, politics ... </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#28:3> <h> <bold> Cegep means better future for all </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#29:3> By Tammy Ballis
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#30:3> <h> What is a Cegep? </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#31:3> In the eyes of a Taoist, it is a well, a spring of fresh, clear

water, a place for the young traveller to quench his thirst.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#32:3> The transformative elixir in this well can slake the <quote> " need

to know" </quote> burning in the mind of life's apprentice.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#33:3> A few swallows and the novice becomes a warrior, prepared to pursue

the path of his choice.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#34:3> The Cegep is thus an essential presence in his life, without it he

might die of thirst. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#35:3> From a Buddhist point of view, the Cegep can be seen as a temple,

a sacred place, a pilgrim's destination, for it is a centre of wisdom and an

archive of information, the present incar <l> nation of an academic community

which has existed since human history began.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#36:3> Here the student seeks discipline, preparation, renewal, and

enlightenment, in a universe devoted to teaching and learning.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#37:3> Here he can touch the hand of the intellectual creative spirit. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#38:3> Put the question to a 17 year-old girl with a feminist heart, and

she might answer that the Cegep is a kind of cocoon, allowing the adolescent

to metamorphose into a wise, mature, and independent woman.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#39:3> Here the present team passes the baton to the future team in the

human relay race. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#40:3> Or take the father of a 16 year old son: how would he define a

Cegep? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#41:3> If he has earned his living by physical labor, he knows all too

well the meaning of the word <mention> " tired" </mention> ; he'll tell you

the Cegep is a means for his son to reach a life less harsh than his own.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#42:3> Here, one can learn to carve a life with brain rather than brawn, a

lesson which must be learned in a technological age. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#43:3> If he is a middle-class pro <l> fessional, his own experience

tells the father that the Cegep is a port of departure.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#44:3> He knows the Cegep years are the gestation period preceding

adulthood, a time to make choices and acquire an education which is not only

academic, but also spiritual and emotional. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#45:3> To the socialist, Cegep is a hub of ideas and ideologies, of

political and social activities.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#46:3> It is a feast to satisfy a hunger for knowledge and understanding of

political processes, complete with a mini-society open to listen and

contemplate change. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#47:3> To the 45 year-old with 25 years of work experience, threat <l>

ened with losing his job if he can't learn to use a computer, the Cegep

offers courses which can bring him up to date in his field. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#48:3> To the woman who left the work force for family reasons, the

Cegep represents the opportunity to reintegrate into the world of work.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#49:3> Here she can find the necessary tools. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#50:3> Even a tourist seeking the name of a local wildflower can use the

Cegep's library as a source of information. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#51:3> This is all very nice, but what about your average,

run-of-the-mill, materialistic guy, who just wants to make enough money to

lead a quiet little life in the suburbs with his wife, his one-and-a-half

children, and his subcompact?
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#52:3> How would he answer the question <quote> " What is a Cegep" </quote> ?

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#53:3> Realistically, he knows the high paying jobs are held by people

with diplomas.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#54:3> He'll be aware that prices are rising, and that even his lifestyle is

becoming a pretty expensive undertaking.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#55:3> If he's reasonably well-informed, he'll know high tech employers are

crying for trained and competent employees.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#56:3> So he'll say, " The Cegep is the way to go!
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#57:3> It's free, in three years I can learn a marketable trade, such as com

<l> puter programming and repair, and then I'll have it made." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#58:3> To sum up, it is obvious that the Cegep can be perceived from

many points of view.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#59:3> I see it as a tunnel transforming the children who enter it into

young men and women, who emerge still young enough to be idealistic, but also

mature enough to have learned patience, perseverance, and commitment to a

cause.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#60:3> Whether you use your Cegep as a place to play volleyball or watch a

good movie cheaply, or entrust it with fostering understanding and discipline

in young people, it's definitely an essential presence in modern society.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#61:3> <it> Tammy Bailis, a teacher of mathematics and computer science

in the English section of the Sept-lles Cegep, won a &dollar;500 award in a

recent province-wide contest with this essay, originally written in French.

<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#62:4> <h> <bold> " Divorce" decision needs more thought </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#63:4> By Karen Macdonald

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#64:4> <quote> " Let's get the divorce over with first and then we'll

divide up the bounty" </quote> is what many Quebec nationalists have been

saying during this latest round of constitutional wrangling.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#65:4> That's what Lise Payette had to say to Peter Gzowski last week during

the conference of the Canadian Association of Journalists. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#66:4> It is true that occasionally we hear about divorced couples

remarrying the same partner, but it is unlikely that the rest of Canada would

be willing to take Quebec back once separation is a <it> fait accompli </it> .

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#67:4> No wonder federalists and even some nationalists argue that

Quebec should take its time making any decision about its future.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#68:4> The political debate going on in Quebec and Canada today will change

the course of history.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#69:4> Any decisions made by Quebec unilaterally or by Quebec in

negotiations with Ottawa and / or the other provinces should be made only

with careful consideration for all sides of the issue. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#70:4> After all, before six million people decide to get a divorce,

they should sleep on it, for at least a couple of nights. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#71:5> <h> <bold> The case for Easter </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#72:5> By Rev. Bill Jay
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#73:5> Chalmers-Wesley United Church ( Quebec) and St. Andrew's United

Church ( Valcartier Village)

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#74:5> A few years ago, while living in Montreal, I followed with great

interest a series of on-spot news reports carrying a story out of Jerusalem.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#75:5> The story, covered locally by radio station CJAD, gripped the

interest of listeners as it unfolded. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#76:5> It began on a Sunday with the report of a large demonstration in

support of a strange religious figure, which alarmed the religious leaders of

Israel, calling on the government to have him put to death for allegedly

calling himself the Son of God. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#77:5> In a lynch-mob atmosphere, the following hours saw this figure

put through hasty trials and sentencing to the death penalty.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#78:5> The cruel public execution was reported in all its gruesome detail,

even including a kind of poker game that the executioners apparently played

at the victim's feet! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#79:5> And, in a classic example of covering up a shameful deed, the

dead body was whisked away from the cross where the death penalty had been

carried out.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#80:5> Scarcely had the body grown cold in its temporary grave, when a

bulletin reported it had vanished. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#81:5> At the same time, this unfortunate man, recently killed, was

reported to have been seen alive by a number of his close friends. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#82:5> Well, I'm sure you have guessed by now whom I am speaking of -

Jesus, whose living presence we celebrate this coming Sunday, Easter.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#83:5> Obviously, if these events described in a modern journalistic fashion

had not occurred, we would probably not be observing Easter in our time. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#84:5> But hold on, why would a story more than a few days old, let

alone 2,000 years old, be of that much interest that millions of people would

gather in churches to hear it all over again?
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#85:5> After all, isn't it stale news?
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#86:5> Haven't we heard it for the umpteenth time, ever since our earliest

childhood? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#87:5> What is it about this story that holds our attention?
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#88:5> By itself it's just another senseless, cruel assassination or

killing, not unlike those we have heard of in such countries as El Salvador

and Chile. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#89:5> I submit that by itself the death would have been forgotten in

days, if not hours, if it had not been for precisely what had angered the

religious authorities of <w> Jesus' </w> time causing them to have him put to

death. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#90:5> Paul the apostle, a noted leader of the early Christian Church,

provides a convincing argument for believing in this Jesus as indeed being

One sent by God.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#91:5> ( You can read it in detail for yourself in the Bible in Acts 109:

37-43)
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#92:5> That short, but powerful stating of the case for believing in Jesus

is what both angered the evil, corrupt religious leaders of the day and has

given new hope and encouragement for millions of people since. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#93:5> In short, the case for Easter is the healing, forgiving, empow

<l> ering experiences that are today possible for you because of what

happened 2,000 years ago. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#94:5> I invite you to attend church this coming Sunday to hear once

again this magnificent story of hope. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#95:6> <h> <bold> The Law and You: Details involved in settling an estate

</bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#96:6> When a person passes away, the family's immediate concern is to

make the necessary funeral arrangements in an expedient manner according to

the wishes of the deceased expressed in his or her Last Will and Testament or

according to the family's good judgment if there is no will. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#97:6> However, once those formali <l> ties are seen through, one must

also settle the estate of the deceased.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#98:6> Depending on the assets and liabilities in the estate, it may be very

straightforward or very complex.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-006#99:6> Either way, one must make sure that it is done properly and

efficiently so that there will be no unforseen problems afterwards. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-006#100:6> The family usually goes through a mourning period and is not

ready or willing to handle the technical aspects of a loved one's estate

settlement. </p> </I>
