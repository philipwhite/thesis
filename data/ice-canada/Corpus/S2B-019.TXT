can have trouble and that's what happened there

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-019#115:5:A> Slowly

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-019#116:5:B> Compared to yesterday

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-019#117:5:A> <{> <[> Yeah </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-019#120:5:B> Not to bad a day actually
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#121:5:B> A bit breezy and at least we have some bright weather with us for

the moment
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#122:5:B> The cloud is beginning to build though and it its the type of

cloud that builds from instability uh <@> george </@> and that's exactly what

we have <,> uh moving in
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#123:5:B> Just someting to kick off perhaps the odd rain shower
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#124:5:B> Even an isolated thunder <unclear> <?> storm </?> </unclear> is

not <}> <-> <}> <-> <.> po </.> </-> <+> possible </+> </}> </-> <=>

impossible </=> </}> a little later on this afternoon and into the early

evening
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#125:5:B> That's because of a weak upper disturbance that will be ah moving

across the area rather quickly <,> late today
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#126:5:B> Uh quickly in that <,> it won't take long to clear right out

behind it later on this evening and tonight
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#127:5:B> So <}> <-> a </-> <=> a </=> </}> very short lived weak

disturbance moving through <,> and that could give us a widely scattered rain

showers even an isolated thunder shower
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#128:5:B> Otherwise temperatures up into the mid teens this afternoon
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#129:5:B> Uh generally in the fourteen to seventeen range for our highs
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#130:5:B> And we'll have those south westerly winds uh remain in the twenty

to fourty range right through the afternoon
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#131:5:B> They'll begin to die down this evening
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#132:5:B> Overnight uh under those clearing skies dropping off to between

one and six degrees for our lows
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#133:5:B> Tomorrow we'll have the sunshine with us again
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#134:5:B> Almost a carbon copy of what we have today <@> george </@> except

for the precipitation which will hold off <,> until thursday morning by the

looks of it
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#135:5:B> But we will see some morning sunshine give way to an increase in

cloud during the afternoon
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#136:5:B> Uh warming up to about fifteen to eighteen for a high
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#137:5:B> Back to normal values
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#138:5:B> And again those southwest winds <,> will shift around to the

southeast in the afternoon
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#139:5:B> Picking up to about fifteen to thirty
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#140:5:B> Thursday is the most unsettled day of the week by the looks of it
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#141:5:B> Lots of cloud around
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#142:5:B> Uh <?> summer </?> showers or rain <,> and uh hughs again of

around seventeen degrees
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#143:5:B> But by friday we're back to the sunshine <,> as high pressure

begins to build in for at least the beginning of the weekend
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#144:5:B> Uh high on <,> <}> <-> <.> f </.> </-> <+> friday </+> </}> of

around nineteen degrees
<ICE-CAN:S2B-019#145:5:B> Saturday uh sunny to begin with <,> but i think we'll see some
