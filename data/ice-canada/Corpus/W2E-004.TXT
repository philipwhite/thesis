<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#1:1> <h> <bold> <it> Word of advice from former chief </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#2:1> Oh, my goodness ...
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#3:1> I thought I was the chief of the Fort Norman band council in my

earlier years and crazy me, I believed I grew up in Fort Norman but after

your latest edition of <it> News/North </it> , I wonder ... did I grow up in

Fort Franklin?
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#4:1> And here I thought Fort Franklin was by a big lake by the name of

Sahtu or Great Bear Lake. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#5:1> The picture in your latest edi <l> tion says the lovely little

communi <l> ty at the junction of Great Bear River and Mackenzie River and by

Bear Rock, the community which faces the Mackenzie Moun <l> tains and Mackay

Range, the community which the people fondly call Tulit'a and the same

community where my brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, uncles, aunts and

friends live is Fort Franklin by Great Bear Mountain. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#6:1> I suppose I should be getting used to this by now.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#7:1> Denendeh K'e had the community on the other side of the river on a map

they started their show with last year.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#8:1> Whenever I used to go to the South, people wondered if Fort Norman was

in the Yukon or Alaska.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#9:1> Eric Nielson in his book - The House is Not a Home - says Fort

Norman's <quote> " population consisted mostly of Dogrib In <l> dians"

</quote> and <quote> " we were the only non-natives in that community for the

two years of my father's tour there." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#10:1> So you see, we all make mistakes, but just a word of ad <l> vice.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#11:1> If a community sits on the Mackenzie with a Peteni'a ( rock into

water) sitting beside it, it may be Wrigley or Fort Norman.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#12:1> If the community sits by another river joining the Mackenzie it might

be Arctic Red River, Fort Simpson or Fort Norman.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#13:1> If the community sits by a Peteni'a and a river join <l> ing the

Mackenzie it's probably Fort Norman. </p>

</bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#17:2> I am very concerned over the financial cutbacks to the GNWT and

services.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#18:2> Not only will educa <l> tion suffer but many other organizations who

depend on government funding will suffer as well. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#19:2> Social services, women's or <l> ganizations and other programs

and public services will need to ask for donations from corpora <l> tions and

the public sector.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#20:2> We will not be able to depend on secure funding from any part of the

GNWT. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#21:2> The rest of Canada weeps over their own tax increases, but how

will we Northerners be able to af <l> ford to stay and live here once our tax

increases begin. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#22:2> Our future is our children.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#23:2> My concern though is what will be there for our children if many ser

<l> vices will have to close due to lack of funding.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#24:2> Will they move south like so many others do? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#25:2> My question is directed to the government of Canada.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#26:2> Why do you refuse us the secure funding to produce a strong and

financially secure North.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#27:2> If you can spend on the Meech Lake Accord for Que <l> bec, why not

the N.W.T. econom <l> ic question? </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#30:3> <h> <bold> McCann missed point </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#31:3> Your Feb. 12 issue of <it> News/ North </it> contained a letter

from David McCann, chairperson of the Denendeh Planning Commission, in reply

to the criticisms I made about this new land use planning commission in the

Jan. 13 <it> News/ North </it> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#32:3> Mr. McCann's comments about my criticisms completely miss my

point.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#33:3> I think he should read your Feb. 12 article again.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#34:3> I did not say or even imply that the commission is biased towards

industrial de <l> velopment and against conserva <l> tion as Mr. McCann

claims. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#35:3> I did imply, however, that the four territorial and federal

govern <l> ment appointees to the commis <l> sion appear to be biased in

favor of industrial development since their backgrounds are in the min <l>

ing, oil and gas industries and since two of them hold executive positions

with chambers of com <l> merce and with the Chamber of Mines. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#36:3> Fortunately, the other four members of this commission are

selected by the Dene / Metis, so the conservation viewpoint should be well

represented by these appointees. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#37:3> I am only disappointed that neither the territorial nor federal

governments saw fit to appoint so <l> meone with a conversation or en <l>

vironmental background.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#38:3> That says a great deal to me about what direction both levels of gov

<l> ernment want land use planning to take in the North. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#39:3> It's pretty obvious to me that the territorial and federal govern

<l> ments have stacked their side of the deck on the side of develop <l> ment

at the expense of environ <l> mental protection. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#40:3> It may also be of interest that the Denendeh Conservation Board

expressed concerns sim <l> ilar to mine about this land use planning

commission at their December meeting in Aklavik. </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#43:4> <h> <bold> New bridge needed, not new legislature </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#44:4> Re: <it> News/North </it> Monday Jan. 22, 1990

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#45:4> In the above mentioned newspaper, Richard Nerysoo stated that a

new legislative assembly building will be built as of 1993. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#46:4> I feel that before this pro <l> ject is started, a long-awaited,

long-needed bridge should be built across the Mackenzie River near Fort Pro

<l> vidence.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#47:4> This would pro <l> vide access to the heavily populated areas of

Yellowknife and Fort Rae. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#48:4> Those persons who de <l> pend on goods and sup <l> plies from

Yellowknife, liv <l> ing north and northeast, and depend on an air supp <l>

ly would benefit from this bridge also. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#49:4> This investment in a bridge would bring a better return to the

people of the N.W.T. than would a legislative assembly building. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#50:4> The cost of maintaining a ferry and building an ice road would be

a saving as a bridge would not require as much maintenance. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#51:4> The legislative assembly building could be put on hold for

several years more without any hardship to the residents of the N.W.T. </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#54:5> <h> <bold> Language debate is not bigotry </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#55:5> The new session of the legislature started with a mild

bloodletting over ter <l> ritorial laws appearing in French as well as

English.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#56:5> The debate, emotional rather than inflammatory, saw most MLAs

champion native languages and several plead for universal linguistic

tolerance.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#57:5> Nevertheless, with help from the national media, Northerners end <l>

ed up looking like bigots anyway. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#58:5> <quote> " French-English battle creeps into the N.W.T," </quote>

declared the weekend Globe and Mail, wrapping us neatly up with a story on

the Soo, a column from Quebec and an editorial. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#59:5> The national CBC, covering the story mainly because they were in

Yellowknife for the Liberal leadership forum anyway ( TV journalism means

news is wherever the camera happens to be), ignored one basic principle:

Linguistic intolerance among those who speak French or English looks more

like linguistic injustice to those who speak neither. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#60:5> Bigotry applies to English- or French-speaking Canadians who can,

if they want to, navigate the law in their own mother tongue, but who don't

think the other founding group deserves the same privilege. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#61:5> The debate last week was not an ap <l> peal to bigotry but an

appeal for respect.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#62:5> <quote> " European languages were imposed on us," </quote> said

Culture Minister Titus Allooloo. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#X63:5> <quote> " Our languages were not as important as theirs." </quote>

</X>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#64:5> It raised the ques <l> tion of whether, in the N.W.T., there are two

founding peoples or nine. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#65:5> The working language of the ter <l> ritorial government is

English, and fran <l> cophones now have laws in their own language, not just

in translation. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#66:5> Yet seven other languages were spoken here for a thousand years

before French and English appeared.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#67:5> Little wonder aboriginal speakers feel they get no respect. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#72:6> I thought we would have more coverage in the major newspapers on

the historic Liberal Party forum in Yellowknife, but it was dis <l>

appointing.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#73:6> The Edmonton Journal, for one, must favor Paul Martin.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#74:6> With the small coverage, they had his picture two days in a row and

no one else. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#75:6> I was also disappointed in Focus North.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#76:6> It was too short for such an event.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#77:6> They should have allowed the whole hour to the Liberal meeting. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#78:6> It's cute of the Liberals to push for the aboriginal vote by

setting up an Aboriginal <w> Peoples' </w> Commission.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#79:6> The Liberals are busy trying to build the party and to woo the

aboriginals after their misdemeanor of the 1969 Indian paper ( or white

paper). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#80:6> Some of our native students going to univer <l> sities are

studying that era; they told me about it and they were shocked!
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#81:6> Maybe some of you gullible natives should read the book by Harold

Cardinal called The Unjust Society, and the book by E. Palmer Patterson

called The Cana <l> dian Indian: a History Since 1500.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#82:6> Very interesting. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#83:6> And by the way, the Liberals are not the first to recognize the

importance of the aboriginal vote!
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#84:6> The P.C. party in 1986 had the first Na <l> tional P.C. Aboriginal

Caucus in Ottawa, and they have very strong natives from across Canada

involved. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#85:6> I don't know who made the biggest impres <l> sion at the Liberal

forum.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#86:6> It was like a circus, each one trying to outdo the other.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#87:6> Chretien, they say, is a carbon copy of Trudeau and you natives must

remember that Trudeau is sup <l> posed to have said there were no treaties.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#88:6> No Indians on these shores I guess. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#89:6> Paul Martin seems to be next in popularity.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#90:6> I like Sheila Copps, but she is too young - like one newspaper

remarked, she's like a teenie-bopper.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#91:6> And I don't know if the House of Com <l> mons is a good place to drag

your babies into.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#92:6> Couldn't she afford a nanny like all those big shots?
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#93:6> Nunziata and Wappel come on the band wagon too late for Northerners

to know who they are. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#94:6> Aboriginal people can make the government stand up and take

notice if they can get their act together, such as being united across Canada

- the Indians, Metis and Eskimos, and all speaking in one voice. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#95:6> Make up a huge delegation of assorted aboriginal people and lobby

and demand a meeting with the ministers and premiers.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#96:6> We hear of this and that group saying once in a while that they don't

like Meech Lake or the GST or whatever, but it's only little voices here and

there in the wilderness across the land. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#97:6> But it's too late to even talk about unity among the various

groups.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#98:6> They are like government: all on a power trip.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#99:6> They have never had it so good, so you can't blame them either.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#100:6> We learn fast from the Europeans. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#101:6> As an individual I feel that we as aboriginal people let

everything slip through our fingers!
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#102:6> Twenty years ago, even 10 years ago had we all worked together

across Canada in unity for our people we could have had the world in our

hands.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#103:6> But we all went in splinter groups, each one looking or chasing a

rainbow, power trip, jealousies, greed, egos, all got in the way of the

glorious plan of salvaging what was left of the deal our people made with the

Crown of England. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#104:6> We played right into the government's hope and dream of dividing

and conquering and now it's still going on.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#105:6> Look at our AIP. </p> </I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#109:7> Valentine's Day, after the snowstorm of greeting cards and empty

heart-shaped boxes has been swept away, is or was the day given over by the

church to the memory of no fewer than eight Christian martyrs.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#110:7> Is it not ironic that this year Feb. 14 also marked the first an <l>

niversary of the intended martyrdom of Salman Rushdie, author of Shame,

Midnight's Children and of course, The Satanic Verses, sentenced to death by

the late Ayatollah Khomeni? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#111:7> To celebrate Valentine's Day a number of Yellowknife writers,

inspired by Cupid and familiar faces in the audience, stood up in the museum

theatre on the weekend and read both the prose and poems of famous authors

and their own more modest compositions.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#112:7> Salman Rushdie no longer appears in public to read his creations

into the con <l> sciousness of the world.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#113:7> He is in hiding. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-004#114:7> Ironically again, the late Ayatollah Khomeni's death sentence

has raised the profile of Mr. Rushdie's most recent novel and has contributed

in large measure to its commercial success.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#115:7> There is a growing " who's who" of distinguished people who have

bought the book, some of whom have attempted to read it.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#116:7> It is not an easy novel.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-004#117:7> Described in a recent Harper's Magazine as a post-modernist work,

the book circles the globe, striding across cultures, symbolisms and of

course, religious taboos. </p> </I>
