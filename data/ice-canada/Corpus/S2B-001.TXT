answer emergencies
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#35:2:B> Mayor Bourque says he's asked for a report on the extent of

lapdancing in the city
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#36:2:B> The issue was raised last week when a stripper from Toronto said

more than prostitution but they say police are ignoring it
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#45:2:C> Mayor Pierre Bourque says he's already asked for a report on the

problem

<$ZZ> <ICE-CAN:S2B-001#46:2:Z> <X> I don't want <}> <-> to </-> <=> to </=> </}> get

involved in all type of things related to morality
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#X47:2:Z> I'll leave that to these people <,> but when it's concern uh

exploitation of people like uh it was mentioned <,> we have to be aware of

them </X>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S2B-001#48:2:C> Bourque says he wants to find out what Toronto has done <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#49:2:C> That said he's still looking for ways to ban lapdancing
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#50:2:C> <@> Janine Garcia </@> C B C News Montreal

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-001#51:2:B> Bourque says the city will look into a complaint <}> <-> on

<-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> remove them </X>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-001#54:2:B> <@> Steele </@> told Bourque a poster he'd brought with him to

the meeting had been taken from a hydropole
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#55:2:B> <@> Steele </@> says the posters are illegal because the referendum

campaign hasn't started yet
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#56:2:B> Bourque is also promising to find out about the use of pesticides

by the city's paramunicipal corporations
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#57:2:B> The independent councillor for N D G <@> Norton Gartener </@> <,>

says Montreal's housing agency routinely sprays pesticides on the lawns of

its residences for seniors
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#58:2:B> The mayor insists all chemical fertilizers used on city property

are safe <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#59:2:B> <@> Gartener </@> wants more than Bourque's word

<$F> <ICE-CAN:S2B-001#60:2:F> If it's not a concern <,> then let's hold a public

consultation and let's get the people who've done the studies <,> to come in

<,> address the mayor and have an open study and an open consultation to find

out exactly if it is dangerous or not
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#61:2:F> <@> Gartener </@> says a large lawn at a <w> seniors' </w>

residence on Westhill Avenue was sprayed with fertilizers including two four

D even though there's a community centre on the property where children play
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#62:2:F> Pesticides also came up at a council meeting in C&ocircumflex;te

St-Luc
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#63:2:F> A school teacher <@> Sammi Newt </@> wanted to know why

C&ocircumflex;te St-Luc hasn't passed a bylaw banning them like some other

suburbs have
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#64:2:F> Mayor Bernard Lang says his city is watching to see the outcome of

a court challenge to Hudson's bylaw
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#65:2:F> That's not good enough for <@> Newt </@>

<$G> <ICE-CAN:S2B-001#66:2:G> C&ocircumflex;te-St-Luc is waiting to hear <}> <-> their </->

<=> the </=> </}> verdict except this could be years
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#67:2:G> And meantime C&ocircumflex;te-St-Luc residents are spraying this

and it just doesn't matter if I don't spray
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#68:2:G> If my neighbour sprays or if a block away <}> <-> my </-> <=> that

</=> </}> neighbour sprays it affects me <,> and it affects our pets and it

affects our children and it affects our air and everything

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-001#69:2:B> <indig> Newt </indig> points to Hampstead where pesticides

have been banned during the summer
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#70:2:B> She says that's just a half-measure but at least it's a start
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#71:2:B> Washington's ambassador to Canada James Blanchard has made it clear

once again the United States prefers a strong and united Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#72:2:B> Significance is being given to the timing of Blanchard's comments

and the fact they came in Quebec City

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S2B-001#74:2:D> United States ambassador James Blanchard says Quebec is a very

political place
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#75:2:D> he didn't mention the referendum but Blanchard did have praise for

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S2B-001#80:2:D> Blanchard was quoting from President Bill Clinton's speech to

Parliament back in February
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#81:2:D> That particular passage left Bloc Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois leader

Lucien Bouchard angry <,> sitting sterned <&> not " stern" </&> faced while

government and reform M Ps gave Clinton a standing ovation
<ICE-CAN:S2B-001#82:2:D> With just three months to go until the promised referendum <,> it's
