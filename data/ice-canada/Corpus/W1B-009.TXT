<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#1:1> Dear <@> Janet </@> : </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#2:1> It was great talking to you for your birthday and catching up on

each other's lives.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#3:1> However, it did make me realize how much does transpire on a day to

day basis so I thought I would drop you this note to fill you in on some

details. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#4:1> I hope you got my articles by mail.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#5:1> What do you think?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#6:1> How about some feedback?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#7:1> Pretend you're my editor. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#8:1> First and foremost - Hi <@> Anne </@> !
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#9:1> I'm so glad your check up went well and your " body" ( as well as your

buddy) is fine.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#10:1> How is the new course you're teaching? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#11:1> All is quite well in Calgary.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#12:1> <@> Tim </@> and I have had a particularly busy week and are fighting

fatigue, but it is a GOOD fatigue: </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#13:1> - <@> Christina </@> visited from Saturday till Tuesday.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#14:1> We kept going all weekend and enjoyed " quality time" together.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#15:1> On Saturday, we attended the 10th birthday bash for our Centre for

the Performing Arts - took a back stage tour of one of our local theatres and

listened to an acapella band called the HeeBee GeeBees.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#16:1> For dinner, we dined on lasagna, salad, bread and wine back at our

house.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#17:1> On Sunday, we went to the Home and Interior Design show down at our

Stampede Grounds and had fun checking out the booths, designs and displays.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#18:1> <@> Chris </@> met another Calgary buddy for a <}> <-> bar-b-que </->

<+> barbecue </+> </}> Sunday night.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#19:1> On Monday, we shopped, saw a movie ( The Usual Suspects with Gabriel

Byrne - suspenseful) and went out for dinner to one of my favourite spots -

Cilantro.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#20:1> On Tuesday morning, we went out for coffee then it was off to the

airport.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#21:1> I worked until 9 that evening, then crashed!!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#22:1> <@> Christina </@> seemed to have a good time.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#23:1> It not only gave us time together, but allowed her some time for

herself.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#24:1> I suspect there is very little alone time with 2 young boys.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#25:1> She is already talking about the whole family coming out for Stampede

1997! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#26:1> - Wednesday, Catholic Family Service held its annual Board /

Staff retreat after work.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#27:1> We broke into small groups and delved into issues like leadership,

values and agency beliefs.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#28:1> We reviewed our mission statement and of course returned to our

regular debate about whether or not it should be so general <}> <-> ie </->

<+> i.e. </+> </}> <quote> " CFS fosters wellness in and with the community

of Calgary" </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#29:1> I'm of the mind that we need some more specificity or uniqueness in

the statement.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#30:1> Others say there is nothing wrong with the mission being very general

- details come in the vision application.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#31:1> Needless to say, we came to no sound conclusion and will likely be

revisiting this exercise again.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#32:1> I'd like to see us address a real strategic plan rather than worry

too much about our mission statement. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#33:1> - Thursday I worked a little late interviewing new volunteers for

our lifebook writing program. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#34:1> - Friday, <@> Tim </@> and I grabbed a burger after work and I

crashed again! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#35:1> Today, I had to work for a few hours ( I'm not REALLY a

workaholic - it's just that September and October are our busiest months and

since I'm taking 6 weeks holiday for Australia and Christmas, I need to have

all my ducks in a row at work before mid November and it's likely not too

early to begin getting ready now) then <@> Tim </@> and I tootled around

downtown, looked at some open houses
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#36:1> ( we would like to move inner city one day if we can manage it) and

ran some errands. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#37:1> Tomorrow, <@> Tim </@> 's mom arrives for 3 weeks and during her

time here we're throwing her a SURPRISE 75th birthday party!!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#38:1> She's an excellent guest - likes her time alone while we're working,

likes to cook and fill our freezer with yummy food, likes doing laundry and

ironing ( what is ironing?), likes walking along the river with me, likes

playing crib with <@> Tim </@> , likes going for lunch with my aunt <@>

Doreen </@> , likes going to mass on the weekend, likes doing crosswords and

watching sports on TV.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#39:1> This trip, we were able to snag Rankin Family tickets for the four of

us ( <@> Tim </@> 's sister <@> Rita </@> is also coming to visit from

Toronto as a birthday surprise) so we're looking forward to <unclear> their

concert </unclear> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#40:1> We've also been invited to a friend's for dinner and a housewarming

while mom is here and she will likely want to invite some of our buddies over

for an Italian feast <}> <-> ie </-> <+> i.e. </+> </}> homemade macaroni and

sauce, pork tenderloin, lettuce / tomato and cucumber salad and fresh pie.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#41:1> She is quite a woman.... </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#42:1> So that's been the week.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#43:1> Here are some general updates: </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#44:1> I'm reading Jonathan Kellerman's Over The Edge.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#45:1> I love his books - this is an earlier piece which I'd missed.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#46:1> Another Alex Delaware novel ... <@> Christina </@> treated me to

Elizabeth George's Playing for the Ashes and Laurie King's A Grave Talent.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#47:1> A friend of mine suggested I locate Composing a Life by Catherine

Bateson and I want to get my hands on your recommendation, Picasso's Woman.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#48:1> What have you been reading of late, <@> Jan </@> ? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#49:1> Got A Recent Future CD by James Keelaghan for my birthday.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#50:1> Very nice - maybe it's particularly appealing because I caught James

with Oscar Lopez at a benefit concert for street kids and was smitten by them

both! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#51:1> We had a 17 year old Japanese girl stay with us for 2 weeks in

August.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#52:1> This was our second term with the " homestay" sponsored by Mount <@>

Cook </@> College.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#53:1> <@> Miyo </@> went to English school and attended organized

activities during the day and we chummed with her on weeknights and weekends.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#54:1> We had lots of fun making origami, cooking, ice skating ( yes, we

took her skating at the university's Olympic Oval), playing cards, learning

Japanese script and pantomiming when we couldn't understand each other!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#55:1> <@> Miyo </@> was from Tokyo and really enjoyed her time in "

spacious" Canada. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#56:1> I'm leaping into the technology jungle by taking a Windows course

October 3!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#57:1> Actually, I can hardly wait.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#58:1> We have windows at home and we're converting to windows at work, so

I'm anxious to learn all about it.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#59:1> Every day, I feel like I'm losing ground, so I hope this brief course

will give me the jumpstart I need to learn more about getting the most from

my <}> <-> pc </-> <+> PC </+> </}> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#60:1> Did I tell you that my 80 year old Uncle <@> Dennis </@> and I

are taking a course on writing a novel?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#61:1> ( I have a feeling I may have told you all this, <@> Jan </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#62:1> Forgive me if I'm repeating myself - didn't take long after I turned

40 for my memory to slip, eh?)
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#63:1> A local writer named <@> Dianne Jamies </@> is instructing and we're

both hoping to pick up a few tips -
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#64:1> Jack has written 2 non-fiction books already ( an autobiographical

piece about his work as a war correspondent during WW 2 and a textbook on

public relations) but is looking for tips on how to switch to fiction and I'm

looking for writing tips in general and for an opportunity to spend time with

my uncle, the " writer".
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#65:1> We're going to have fun - Jack said he would go with me if our desks

were side by side ... </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#66:1> My big sister volunteer role is coming to a close.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#67:1> <@> Brittany </@> and I have been together for our year and for the

last 6 months, she has lived with her mom, so my contact is not really

required anymore.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#68:1> We've developed a good relationship and it has really been positive

for me to spend weekly time with a young person.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#69:1> I hope it has meant the same for <@> Brittany </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#70:1> Today she told me that she has a new haircut and that tonight she is

off to see Montel Williams ( alternative rock, I assume) in concert with her

friend <@> Nora </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#71:1> I'm not sure how I could've forgotten THAT as she's been talking

about this event for weeks!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#72:1> This is her first concert without family or relatives, so it is a big

deal.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#73:1> She is 13 going on 25 - I like her.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#74:1> She is bright, creative and unfortunately, very easily influenced by

peers.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#75:1> I hope she does well and breaks out of her family successfully.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#76:1> I don't think I'm ready for another little sister, so I'll be hunting

for another type of volunteer work.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#77:1> If Calgary gets the bid for the 2005 World Fair, that might be an

exciting volunteer experience. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#78:1> On October 22, a colleague and I are presenting a workshop on our

volunteer programs in <@> Metrotown </@> at the Child Welfare League of

Canada conference.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#79:1> I am scared to death, but am looking forward to it just the same.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#80:1> <@> Louise </@> and I are organizing a panel discussion composed of

volunteers and families who have been serviced by our volunteers and by way

of stories from the panel members, intend to cover topics like:
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#81:1> how volunteers work with child welfare workers,
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#82:1> how families benefit ( or not) from volunteer friends,
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#83:1> what type of training would best prepare volunteers for outreach

work,
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#84:1> what tips could be given to volunteers who work with community

families ........
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#85:1> wish us luck! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#86:1> Am still working out weekdays at my club, <@> Angels </@>

Fitness.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#87:1> It is very convenient - right next door to my work - so I generally

sneak over at lunchbreak.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#88:1> I take whatever class is going - sometimes it is low bounce,

sometimes it is extended cardio, sometimes it is step ...
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#89:1> I also walk whenever I can and have golfed more this summer than in

previous years.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#90:1> My game is pretty steady - have broken 100, but only in Arizona! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#91:1> Theatre starts on October 12.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#92:1> Four of us women go for dinner then out to a theatre production at

Theatre <@> Bigtown </@> about 6 times per year.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#93:1> This year's roster includes Little House of Horrors.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#94:1> We've been doing this for 5 years and look forward to each play.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#95:1> Even if we don't end up giving every play raving reviews, we have fun

critiquing. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#96:1> Writing wise, I've submitted a short article on our Teen Parent

Friend program to a local newsletter called <@> VolReview </@> ( the <@>

Association of Volunteer Resources </@> magazine), and hope they'll publish.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#97:1> I've also submitted a poem to a woman in California who is collecting

pieces for a book called: From the Heart - Letters from Daughters to their

Fathers.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#98:1> She's written me back saying she is considering my poem for the book.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#99:1> I am thinking about entering a short story contest from Regina called

the Short Grain Writing contest - this would be a first for me and now that

I've told you, I guess I'll have to do it, right? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#100:1> Over the last few years, I've been contemplating returning to

school for graduate studies, but I'm not at all sure I want to go for a

masters in social work.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#101:1> In fact, I'm thinking about a graduate degree in communication

studies.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#102:1> Currently, I'm researching the program at the U of C - talking to

professors who teach there as well as students who are taking or who have

graduated from the program.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#103:1> I'm in the information gathering phase ... will keep you posted.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#104:1> Less than 2 months until Australia and we can hardly wait!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#105:1> This time, we'll be flying to Sydney via Singapore, then will move

south to Tasmania, north again to Adelaide then to the westcoast and Perth.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#106:1> It should be a very nice break - I've been able to negotiate a

further 2 weeks off for Christmas in Calgary - before returning to reality in

January 1996. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#107:1> Haven't heard much from <@> Sadie </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#108:1> I usually hear from her on my birthday and Christmas.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#109:1> I trust she and the family are doing well and that the breast cancer

is in remission.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#110:1> Got great birthday greetings from Larry - it sounds like they've

been busy travelling this summer - give him my best if you see him before I

get to write to him, OK? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-009#111:1> I remember one time you wanted to know what my typical day was

like.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#112:1> How about I tell you what is in my <}> <-> officespace </-> <+>

office space </+> </}> ?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#113:1> I have a large bare window with a stained glass suncatcher of a pale

blue cowboy hat.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#114:1> I have a clear jar full of jelly beans.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#115:1> I have a desk and an oak table with 2 blue chairs where I conduct my

interviews.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#116:1> I have a vase filled with green wheat which I picked up at

Millarville market last summer, surrounded by colourful greeting cards.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-009#117:1> I have a picture of <@> Tim </@> on the golf course and a black

telephone with a very long cord so I can walk all around my office without

the phone falling off my desk .... <O> end of letter </O> </p> </I>
