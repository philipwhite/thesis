<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-004#1:1:A> Banks and credit unions have opened their wickets for a

donation to the Save the Jets <&> Winnipeg's professional hockey team </&>

trust fund
<ICE-CAN:S2B-004#2:1:A> And tomorrow night Jets supporters will stage what they say will be

the biggest rally in Manitoba's history

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-004#3:1:B> I could easily see twenty to twenty-five thousand people there
<ICE-CAN:S2B-004#4:1:B> I think that would be realistic

event
<ICE-CAN:S2B-004#6:1:A> He's using Jets players and entertainers like Tom Jackson and

members of the Crash Test Dummies to get people out

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-004#7:1:B> Everybody is getting paid the exact same amount <,> of good

feeling
<ICE-CAN:S2B-004#8:1:B> Zero dollars
<ICE-CAN:S2B-004#9:1:B> We have no budget
<ICE-CAN:S2B-004#10:1:B> It's absolutely amazing and I'm referring <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-004#11:1:A> But it will take more than good feeling if this last-ditch

effort to buy the Jets is to work
<ICE-CAN:S2B-004#12:1:A> Business leaders spearheading the plan are believed to have about

three quarters of the money needed to buy the team and guarantee its losses
<ICE-CAN:S2B-004#13:1:A> But that still leaves between twenty and thirty million dollars to

be raised through individual donations
<ICE-CAN:S2B-004#14:1:A> And there's no guarantee government's share <,> a hundred and

eleven million dollars <,> will materialize
<ICE-CAN:S2B-004#15:1:A> If it doesn't the Jets will be sold <,> Thursday afternoon
