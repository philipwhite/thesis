<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#1:1> <h> TRIP REPORT [ FORM B] UNCL March 17, 1995 </h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#2:1> <h> RUSSIA AND THE <@> RFF </@> [ <@> Radical Forum for

Fundamentalists </@> ] CAPER </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-011#3:1> Greetings RAPpers, and other interested parties.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#4:1> This is your trusty colleague, agent <@> Wallaby </@> reporting. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-011#5:1> I was enjoying my customary pre-lunch snooze in my air-conditioned

yurt on the fourth floor of CSIS <&> Canadian Security and Inteligence

Services </&> headquarters, when suddenly I was interrupted by an e-mail

message flashing across my PC screen. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-011#6:1> The word had come down from on high [ no, not the Almighty, and in

the interests of accuracy, it actually came up from the 3rd floor], that a

highly [ make that, hardly] secret mission to Moscow had been commissioned to

exchange information on the IRF threat.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#7:1> The Russians, it had been decided, had something to tell us about the

" green menace".
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#8:1> It could even have a bearing on the security of Canada.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#9:1> What could they possibly know about this subject that we hadn't

already learned from our myriad expert sources?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#10:1> After all, 70 years of communism could hardly have led to privileged

access to the inner sanctums of religious extremism.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#11:1> Could it be that they had succeeded in breaking the <w> mullahs' </w>

secret codes?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#12:1> Could they finally have come up with the elusive original of the

Rushdie <bold> <foreign> fatwa </foreign> </bold> ?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#13:1> Or a draft copy of the Islamic Republic's next five-year plan?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#14:1> Had they figured out what the <foreign> <bold> kabbala </bold>

</foreign> has to say about the future of the Middle East peace process? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-011#15:1> Whatever it was, it behoved us to listen and try to learn, until

we could corroborate or falsify their data.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#16:1> Hoping to narrow the range of this exchange, and perhaps elicit a

clue as to the nature of their insider info, we sent them a list of twenty

topics to choose from, including theoretical and operational categories.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#17:1> Despite our enthusiasm to be more fully in the know, no agenda was

forthcoming on the eve of our scheduled departure.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#18:1> Lulled into complacency by the thought that we could always

extemporise our own views of this broad topic, it nonetheless niggled that we

couldn't know in advance in more detail what they wanted to talk about.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#19:1> Could anything good, or new, come from such an ill-considered

undertaking?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#20:1> What were the risks we faced, apart from intestinal distress and

depleted budgets?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#21:1> Stroking our scepticism, and carefully packing our dog-eared copy of

the IRF bible, Ayatollah Khomaini's <bold> Problems Elucidated </bold> , we

prepared for take-off. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-011#22:1> In the face of such high risk and uncertainty, your intrepid

agent was reassured at rejoining his colleagues in Amsterdam for the final

leg of the journey to Moscow.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#23:1> However foolhardy one's own decision to travel to such a destination

under such obscure circumstances, surely they, with all their worldly

experience, could not also be easily inveigled into a reckless adventure.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#24:1> There must have been more to this meeting than met the eye.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#25:1> Never mind that it was not apparent even to them.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#26:1> All would be revealed in due time.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#27:1> Allah works in wondrous ways.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#28:1> Patience is beautiful. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-011#29:1> Our hosts met us at the end of the disembarkation ramp with a

huge sign bearing the logo Mr. J. C A N U C K.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#30:1> We surrendered our passports and currency declaration forms and were

whisked through customs and immigration to the two vehicles waiting to

transport us to the Guest House in the center of the city.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#31:1> An hour later we were being shown to our rooms in a spacious

apartment on the fifth floor of an old building on <@> Pysanky </@> Street.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#32:1> From the balcony one could see the towers of the Kremlin and the

spires and domes of adjacent churches.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#33:1> So this was it.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#34:1> The moment of truth was approaching.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#35:1> Soon we would know what we hadn't been able to intuit. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-011#36:1> A ridiculous thought crossed my mind as we gazed across the

Moscow skyline and chatted amiably with our English-speaking Russian hosts.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#37:1> Had they discovered some fiendish plot by the Islamic Republic of

Iran to export, along with revolution, the larger and broader dome of the

Islamic world, thus putting the smaller and rounder domes of the Russian

style at a commercial disadvantage in the world market?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#38:1> Naaah, I told myself, that couldn't be it, the smaller version would

sell at a fraction of the larger one's price, even if subsidized, and besides

the futures market for domes, especially in the West, must be somewhat

depressed these days.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#39:1> Maybe the Japanese might go for such a pitch, but I doubted it.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#40:1> It had to be something else.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#41:1> The mystery was deepening and tension building. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-011#42:1> After a sixteen hour plane journey we were exhausted and our

hosts realized they ought to withdraw and leave us to rest.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#43:1> They probably concluded, sensibly, that anything they might learn

from us in our groggy condition would not be entirely focused or reliable.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#44:1> Besides it was they who had something to communicate.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#45:1> The plan was to return at 6:00 p.m. for supper and a tour of the city

afterwards.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#46:1> When they left we checked out our rooms for bugs and found nothing

that Raid couldn't deal with.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#47:1> But we were too tired to talk, and opted to lounge around and read or

take in more of the city from the balcony. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-011#48:1> Pre-occupied with what to expect the following day, we were

unable to contemplate sleep, fearing also that would mean being unable to

sleep through the night.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#49:1> This last worry was pure indulgence; although we didn't retire until

10:30, we all reawakened between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m., and were unable to doze

off again till later that morning.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#50:1> How could we possibly have forgotten to pack the Nitol?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#51:1> Does this tell us something about our policy planning department?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#52:1> This meant we were not at our best during the day's deliberations.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#53:1> This pattern continued with your trusty agent right through the four

nights he spent in Moscow.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#54:1> Was that part of the plan? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-011#55:1> The tour of the city was conducted, to paraphrase an old

apothegm, under the cover of [ gathering] darkness.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#56:1> The major attraction was the view from the Nevsky Prospekt out over

the glittering city below, and a stop near the tall and massive structure

housing Moscow University, ablaze with lights from top to bottom.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#57:1> Talk about the aerie heights of higher education!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#58:1> Getting from a physics lab on the ground floor of this building to a

psychology lecture on the top could take more than half an hour.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#59:1> If the elevators ever broke down, it could take several days.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#60:1> Any student would need to be equipped at all times with a sturdy pair

of mountain boots, and an oxygen pack against thin air.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#61:1> Now we know the meaning of airhead. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-011#62:1> During our stay in the Russian capital the temperature hovered

around 0 centigrade and the streets were free of snow.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#63:1> One gained a distinct impression of space, of room to manouver.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#64:1> For a capital city laid out before the onslaught of the automobile,

the main streets and arteries were remarkably wide and spacious.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#65:1> Perhaps that could be partly due to WWII devastation and

reconstruction.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#66:1> More likely it was the result of Napoleon's siege when the Muscovites

are said to have set fire to three-quarters of the city themselves and razed

it in order to prevent its capture.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#67:1> Whatever the explanation, traffic flow, even at rush hour, seemed

easily manageable, a far cry from the streets of downtown Ottawa, or the

crushing frustration of the drive home to Orleans after work. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-011#68:1> When the traffic did back up slightly near the central region

close to the flat, our driver activated the siren and turned on the light on

the roof of our Mercedes, and took off down the middle [ no-go] lane of the

avenue.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#69:1> Your average Moscow motorist, a fairly disciplined and restrained

breed, in this observer's view, compared to his Montreal counterpart, must

have thought we were some visiting royalty or head of state [ assuming he /

she didn't look too closely].
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#70:1> As we approached an underpass on our route, the delegation head

leaned forward and asked our host in the front seat what the writing said on

a huge banner strung up on the bridge overhead.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#71:1> He replied laconically, <quote> " New Era Bank!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#72:1> [ There are] too many banks!" </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#73:1> Welcome to the world of capitalist competition and advertising. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-011#74:1> We returned to our quarters around 8:30p.m.and prepared to

retire.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#75:1> Before departing for the night our hosts showed us how to work the

lock on the apartment door, and where the key was hung, in case of fire.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#76:1> Looking down on the street below from the balcony one could see

numbers of people still bustling about, even at 9:00p.m.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#77:1> A brightly lit kiosk on the corner across the way was the center of

considerable activity.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#78:1> Cars would pull up in front, their drivers descend, and return

carrying their purchases after visiting the stall.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#79:1> What could this be?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#80:1> What commerce was being conducted at this hour of the night that

couldn't wait till tomorrow?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#81:1> Probably a drug dealer, I told myself.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#82:1> Stripped of its Marxist-Leninist moral purity, Russia had already

joined the real world.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#83:1> Boy, were we in for a surprise.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#84:1> Our sources informed us the following day that this was a flower

stall, that tomorrow was an official holiday in honour of International

Woman's Day, and that these were your worshipful, sensitive, non-MCP Russian

husbands and swains stopping on the way home after a long day at the office

to buy a bouquet for the objects of their devotion.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#85:1> Holy moly!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#86:1> Does the office of the Minister for the Status of Women in Ottawa

realize that the Russians have got the jump on us in the gender stakes?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#87:1> Not much left of the Evil Empire, on that evidence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-011#88:1> But I digress.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#89:1> The main purpose of our mission had to be kept in the forefront of

our attention, <}> <-> i.e </-> <+> i.e. </+> </}> the formal talks.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#90:1> In the course of expounding their view of the IRF threat, the

Russians would reveal some information vital to the security of Canada.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#91:1> We therefore had to be alert to their every word.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#92:1> Given our fractured attention spans, this wasn't easy.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#93:1> Since the words were delivered in Russian, we had to attend the

pauses in their speech, the signal that the interpreter was about to render,

as with a chunk of lard, what had just been said, in polished English.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#94:1> While they were speaking the translator would make a few furious

jottings with a pencil in a little red notebook.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#95:1> Then he would look up and without consulting his notes deliver the

most coherent flow of natural-sounding standard English that we'd ever heard,

without a single <mention> eh </mention> at the end of the sentence.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#96:1> He'd never be able to pass himself off as a <}> <-> Canaydjun </->

<+> Canadian </+> </}> ! - eh. <&> Phonetic spelling of informal

pronunciation of 'Canadian'. </&>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#97:1> By Allah, I swear that fellow must have had a computer in his head.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#98:1> Otherwise how could he produce such fluent and idiomatic language?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#99:1> And just think, it's even more amazing when you realize he could do

all that without ever having had the benefit of a meeting with Margaret

Atwood. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-011#100:1> So much for the talks!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#101:1> Let us now turn to the more substantive side of this mission, <}>

<-> i.e </-> <+> i.e. </+> </}> the food and drink.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#102:1> In a word, they were excellent.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#103:1> It simply wasn't true, all that talk we used to hear about the KGB

agents having had their taste buds extracted as a condition of employment so

they wouldn't be vulnerable to the blandishments of French cuisine.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#104:1> We were offered the full range of traditional Russian fare, pancakes

and cream, borscht, palmeny, cold cuts, the lot, and all of it washed down,

of course, with copious draughts of vodka.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#105:1> This latter was served from a liqueur glass, so it wasn't as

dangerous as it sounds.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#106:1> But every time one took a sip, it would be instantly replaced at the

top of the glass by a most attentive hostess.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#107:1> There were endless toasts to our new-found friendship.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#108:1> Having realized from the business sessions that we were more or less

on the same wavelength on the subject of IRF, we had no trouble identifying

prospects that would justify us raising our glasses.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-011#109:1> One memorable proposal from our hosts revolved around the hope that

Hizbollah would finally see the light, give up its miscreant ways, and go the

mainline legitimate route of its respectable Egyptian cousins, the Muslim

Brothers. </p> </I>
