<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-021#3:1> The number of elderly people in our society is increasing.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#4:1> This is, of course, a result of population growth.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#5:1> The proportion of our population that is elderly is also increasing,

both because of declines in the birth rate and because of increased life

expectancy.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#6:1> Demographers do not agree on the exact details of the shifts in the

age composition of our population and disagree even more strongly regarding

when and if the current trends will abate.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#7:1> However, no matter which demographic calculations are used it is clear

that, at least for the next 50 years, the proportion of elderly individuals

in our society will be increasing ( Chappell, Strain, and Blandford). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-021#8:1> These demographic projections have given rise to a variety of dire

predic <l> tions.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#9:1> It has been suggested that, as a result of longer life expectancy and

dramatic improvement in life-extending technologies, elderly people of the

future will experience longer periods of infirmity before death than today's

elderly people ( Gruenberg; Simmons-Tropea and Osborn).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#10:1> The sugges <l> tion that the price we will pay for longer life

expectancy is a longer period of infirmity before death strikes dread to most

hearts.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#11:1> The constellation of loss of independence, being a burden on others,

and pain or suffering for an extended period seems a high price for a few

extra years of life.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#12:1> In <l> deed, the greatest fear of elderly people is not death or

poverty or loneliness, but incapacity ( Harris). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-021#13:1> Also derived from demographic projections is the suggestion that

health care costs will sky-rocket because resources are disproportionately

expended for care of chronically ill elderly people ( Schulz).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#14:1> In addition, because both increased health care and pension costs

will have to be borne by a propor <l> tionately smaller number of workers,

the financial burden of the elderly population will contribute to

intergenerational conflict over expenditure of available resources (

Neugarten; Tindale and Marshall).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#15:1> Indeed, Callahan ( 1986) has argued that we will approach the point

where the only sensible decision on the societal level will be to terminate

expensive health care prac <l> tices for elderly individuals in favour of

directing virtually all health care resources to younger more productive ( or

potentially productive) in <l> dividuals.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#16:1> Debates on the ethics of such a position have already begun (

Summerville). </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#17:1> <h> <it> An Alternative View: The Compression of Morbidity Hypothesis

</it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-021#18:1> Some experts take issue with the bleak scenario of longer periods

of infirmity occurring as average life expectancy increases and propose a

very different view ( Fries; Maddox).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#19:1> Most controversial among these is James Fries, who, in a 1981 book,

<it> Vitality and Aging </it> ( with Lawrence Crapo), proposed that as more

people live to old age they can live <it> less </it> of their old age with a

serious infirmity.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#20:1> This has been labelled the <quote> " compression of morbidity"

</quote> hypothesis.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#21:1> ( <mention> " Morbidity" </mention> refers to the presence of

disease, <mention> " infirmity" </mention> to the debilitating effects of

disease.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#22:1> In writing about his hypothesis, Fries uses the terms morbidity,

infirmity, and disease interchangeably, and in this respect we have followed

his lead.) </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-021#23:1> The compression of morbidity hypothesis is stated in terms of two

premises: that the maximum human life span is fixed at about 115 years and

that with increased use of techniques of prevention and intervention the age

at which infirmity first occurs will increase.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#24:1> Taken together these two premises lead to the conclusion that the

<it> duration </it> of infirmity will decrease.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#25:1> Although the basic idea has been around for some time ( Pearl), Fries

is cur <l> rently its most ardent and articulate proponent.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#26:1> If the compression of morbidity hypothesis is correct, its

implications are far-reaching, both to individuals and to society.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#27:1> In this paper we will elaborate the hypothesis, evaluate criticisms

of it, and discuss the implications both of accepting and rejecting it.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#28:1> Let us consider each of its premises in turn. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#29:1> <h> <it> Maximum Human Life Span is Fixed at 115 Years </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-021#30:1> This premise has two components, one specifying that the maximum

life span is fixed and the other specifying the particular age at which it is

fixed.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#31:1> These two components differ both in terms of their contentiousness

and in terms of the availability of supporting evidence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-021#32:1> Before proceeding, it is helpful to differentiate among average

life ex <l> pectancy ( the statistically determined age to which an

individual born at a particular time, in a particular place, is likely to

live), normal life span ( the age to which the average human would live if

environmental condi <l> tions were optimal), and maximum life span ( the

maximum age to which an individual human being living under optimal

environmental conditions could possibly live).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#33:1> At the present time, average life expectancy in the developed

countries is approaching 80 years for women and is only 5 - 7 years less for

men ( Myers and Manton).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#34:1> According to Fries the normal human life span is about 85 years and

the maximum human life span is about 115 years. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-021#35:1> Inherent in the concepts of a normal and a fixed maximum life

span is the notion that there is such a thing as a normal process of aging.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#36:1> Although not taking a strong position regarding the specifics, Fries

holds that such a process is probably genetically controlled and determines

that as we age: 1) the capacity of each of the body's organs to function

declines; 2) because the body is composed of multiple organ systems, each of

which is declining, there is an exponentially increasing probability that one

of the systems will fail; 3) because the homeostatic processes of the body

are very finely tuned and easily disrupted, as organ systems deteriorate, the

ability of the body to recover from disruption lessens.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#37:1> Thus, in old age, as a result of the normal process of aging and in

the absence of pathology, the stage is set for death to occur reasonably

quickly, as a result of what would have been a minor disruption earlier in

life - for example, pneumonia, a minor infection, or a drug interaction

effect.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#38:1> From this perspective the normal process of ag <l> ing will lead to

death if some pathological process does not do so first. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-021#39:1> Most experts in the area of biological gerontology hold either

that the body's cells and/or organs break down from regular use ( i.e., in

the absence of pathology), or that there are intrinsic genetic factors which

regulate, somehow, such breakdowns ( Sacher).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#40:1> Despite much debate on the precise nature of the process controlling

normal aging, there is widespread agree <l> ment that such a process exists

and defines some upper limit on the human life span ( Perlmutter and Hall).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#41:1> This is consistent with the fact that all other species seem to have

a fixed maximum life span.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#42:1> The majority position has not, however, gone unchallenged.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#43:1> Because the biological changes that occur with increasing age involve

decline and deterioration, it is extremely difficult to determine whether

particular declines are the result of pathological pro <l> cesses or of

intrinsic factors.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#44:1> Indeed, some argue that there may be no such thing as normal aging,

that all changes are the result of pathology ( Walford).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#45:1> It follows from such a position that if the lethal chronic diseases

afflicting humans could be eliminated, life could continue indefinitely. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-021#46:1> Although most biological gerontologists agree that there are

normal pro <l> cesses of aging and that a fixed maximum life span must

follow, there is substantially less agreement about what this maximum might

be ( Simmons-Tropea and Osborn).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#47:1> Many do not see the question as particularly urgent or important.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#48:1> It is, however, a point crucial to Fries's position.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#49:1> For Fries to argue that compression of morbidity can be achieved in a

foreseeable time frame requires that maximum life span be not very far from

the cur <l> rently documented maximum age of about 115 years.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#50:1> As he notes, although the proportion of individuals living to close

to this apparent maximum has steadily increased from 1900 to 1980, there is

no evidence to indicate that the maximum itself has shifted during this

period. <sp> 1 </sp> <footnote> 1 Some have mistakenly concluded that the

increase in average life expectancy since 1900 ( 47 years in Canada in 1900

to 75 in 1981) may be taken as evidence either that there is no upper limit

to the increase in average life expectancy ( i.e., no fixed maximum life

span) or that the maximum human life span is greater than that which has been

observed to date.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#51:1> However, the increase in average life expec <l> tancy in this century

in the developed countries is the result of reduction in in <l> fant

mortality, the virtual elimination of death from acute infectious diseases,

and increased attention to occupational safety.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#52:1> This increase in average life expectancy cannot be taken as relevant

to determination of the maximum human life span </footnote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#53:1> The fact that average life expectancy has increased but maximum life

span has not is reflected in the increasing <quote> " rectangularization"

</quote> of survival curves ( the percentage of individuals surviving to a

given age in a given year) that has occurred during this century.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#54:1> This rectangularization can be seen in Figure 1. </p> <O> diagram

</O> <O> diagram caption </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-021#55:1> Among the additional arguments Fries cites in favour of the fixed

max <l> imum human life span being about 115 years are: that despite many

claims to extremely long life, the oldest individual whose age was documented

( up to 1981 when the Fries and Crapo book was published) was a Canadian who

died at age 113 years, 124 days; that maximum life span for mammalian species

may be predicted by brain size / body weight ratio; and that there has been

no evidence of change in the maximum human life span over the past 100,000

years.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#56:1> Let us turn now to examine the second premise of Fries's position.

</p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#57:1> <h> <it> Age at First Infirmity Will Increase </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-021#58:1> A model developed by the scientific advisory group of the World

Health Organization ( WHO) is useful in conceptualizing the relationship

between health and longevity.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#59:1> This model distinguishes among morbidity-free life expectancy,

disability-free life expectancy, and total life expectancy.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#60:1> In the typical case there is some period of time between onset of

morbidity and onset of disability, and between onset of disability and death.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#61:1> The length of these two periods varies as a function of age of onset

of morbidity and cause of morbidity.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#62:1> Thus, in the case of relatively rapidly-lethal diseases ( e.g.,

coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer) both the periods of disability-free

morbidity and of disability preceding death tend to be relatively short (

perhaps only two or three years each), whereas for degenerative diseases (

e.g., osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, senile dementia) each period can be

much longer ( perhaps as long as 15 years).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#63:1> For different causes of morbid <l> ity the length of time in each

period will differ somewhat as a function of age of onset of morbidity. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-021#64:1> The current thinking is that as average life expectancy converges

on normal life expectancy for the species more individuals are likely to

develop at least one chronic disease ( e.g., coronary heart disease,

atherosclerosis, respiratory disease, cancer, osteoporosis, senile dementia,

diabetes, etc.) that progresses to the point that he or she will experience a

long period of increasing incapacity ( Schneider and Brody; Simmons-Tropea

and Osborn).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#65:1> Fries argues, however, that it is possible to postpone the onset of

the common chronic diseases by a variety of measures, mostly preventive and

mostly involving aspects of life-style such as weight control, nutrition,

exercise, stress management, elimination of smoking, control of salt intake,

moderation in consumption of alcohol, etc.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#66:1> Timely and appropriate ap <l> plication of such measures would allow

most individuals to remain vital into old age and postpone the onset of

chronic disease, so that most would die as a result of the normal process of

aging before becoming seriously incapacitated by a chronic disease. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#67:1> <h> <it> Argument and Counter-Argument </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-021#68:1> Fries's compression of morbidity hypothesis has attracted an

enormous amount of attention and controversy.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#69:1> There have been countless scholarly and not so scholarly articles

criticizing, supporting, or otherwise com <l> menting on his formulation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#70:1> Among gerontologists few issues have generated as much controversy in

the past 20 or 30 years.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#71:1> The responses have been varied.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#72:1> Some have seemed motivated by an intensely personal, emotion-laden

desire to believe that the life span is not finite or at least that it is

longer than Fries's 115 years.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#73:1> Such a desire may be fuelled by fears of death, wishes for

immortality, or other aspects of individual psychodynamics.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#74:1> Most responses, however, have been of one of two sorts: criticisms of

Fries's interpretation of the data presented to support the com <l> pression

of morbidity hypothesis, or warnings regarding the implications of accepting

the compression of morbidity hypothesis.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#75:1> We shall deal with these in turn. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-021#76:1> Criticism of the compression of morbidity hypothesis is directed

either to the premise of a fixed maximum life span of about 115 years or to

the possibility of delaying the onset of chronic disease.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-021#77:1> Given the reasonably compelling evidence across species that the

maximum life span is fixed and that in humans it is in the vicinity of 115

years, we find it surprising that most criticism focuses on whether the

maximum life span is 115 years, rather than the seemingly more problematic

suggestion that prevention programmes can succeed in altering life-styles

<it> to the degree </it> necessary to significantly delay the onset of

chronic disease. </p> </I>
