<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#1:1:A> So <,> difficult <}> <-> to </-> <=> to </=> </}> really

comment
<ICE-CAN:S1B-071#2:1:A> Then you and I were talking about uhm <,> <}> <-> the </-> uh <=>

the </=> </}> proposed closure of <,> the various schools <{> <[> <}> <-> and

</-> </[> <=> and </=> </}> the position

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#3:1:B> <[> Mm hmm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#4:1:A> Uhm we talked about uhm not relocating or identifying a

specific location <{> <[> but rather </[> an <unclear> word </unclear> <}>

<-> that </-> <=> that </=> </}> we think would be <,> most beneficial for

the placement of our school

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#5:1:B> <[> Mm hmm </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#6:1:B> Right

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#7:1:A> And I was thinking how do we uhm <,> process that with uhm all

the reasons why we would like to keep the <indig> &eacute;cole

premi&egrave;re </indig> system open
<ICE-CAN:S1B-071#8:1:A> Cos we did a lot of background <,> work on that uh last year <{1>

<[1> <,> </[1> when the <indig> &eacute;coles premi&egrave;res </indig> were

uhm somewhat vulnerable
<ICE-CAN:S1B-071#9:1:A> <{2> <[2> before
<ICE-CAN:S1B-071#10:1:A> So </[2> <,> I'm just curious to know uh <}> <-> if </-> <=> if

</=> </}> all of that information is <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+>

</}> be compiled into one document that will go to the L S B <&> school board

</&>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#11:1:B> <[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#12:1:B> <[2> Uh huh uh huh </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#13:1:B> Well <,> uh what we have done so far is <,> the list <}> <->

<.> y </.> you </-> <=> you </=> </}> remember the list that we made of all

the characteristics of the <indig> &eacute;coles premi&egrave;res </indig>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#14:1:A> Mm hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#15:1:B> Well that list was handed in by our school and by <@>

Beakervale </@> and uhm I believe by <@> Larkley </@> as well
<ICE-CAN:S1B-071#16:1:B> Many of the <indig> &eacute;coles premi&egrave;res </indig> were

there handed in that that Tuesday night when we all went to <@> Beakervale

</@> high school and gave <,> some of our ideas to the board about what we

would like to see <{> <[> <,> </[> for that and at the beginning of the race

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#17:1:A> <[> Mm hmm </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#18:1:B> That's where we're letting them know exactly what kind of

schools we want to have
<ICE-CAN:S1B-071#19:1:B> That can also be included in just uh what we wanted to do at that

point was to have all the <indig> &eacute;coles premi&egrave;res </indig> uh

and <indig> &eacute;coles secondaire </indig> <,> handed in to the board to

show the board that we all want to keep this kind of school
<ICE-CAN:S1B-071#20:1:B> We <}> <-> want </-> <=> all want </=> </}> these characteristics

to remain <,> and <}> <-> that </-> <,> <=> that </=> </}> is something <}>

<-> that </-> <=> that </=> </}> is really we're not here to debate about
<ICE-CAN:S1B-071#21:1:B> We just wanted to know <,> that these schools that are vulnerable

where they'll be placed

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#22:1:A> Mm hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#23:1:B> So that's already gone in <,> in this discussion but it can

also be added to <,> whatever we come up with about our particular school and

sit in with that as well
<ICE-CAN:S1B-071#24:1:B> That would probably be a fine <,> idea

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#25:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S1B-071#26:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S1B-071#27:1:A> Just because I feel that uhm <,> uh if <,> one is to <,> uh know

the position paper <{1> <[1> uhm </[1> based on <}> <-> an </-> uhm <,> <=>

the </=> </}> importance of keeping the school open <,> uhm one has to

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#28:1:B> <[1> Mm hmm </[1> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#30:1:A> Uhm <,,> so you didn't identify specific locations but you did

identify geographic <{1> <[1> areas that </[1> you felt <{2> <[2> uhm </[2>

would <{3> <[3> be </[3> <{4> <[4> appropriate and </[4> that was based on

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#124:1:A> So you're seeing this more and more

for </-> <=> for </=> </}> language uhm <,> in school

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#137:1:B> <[> Mm hmm </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#138:1:B> Mm hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#139:1:A> And so <,> I can remember <}> <-> <.> w </.> </-> <+> when

</+> </}> it came time for examinations we had to <,> uh write on index cards

<,> three topics uh that we would like to talk about

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#140:1:B> Mm hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#141:1:A> And uh <,> because <,> I did <,> so much horseback riding <}>

<-> in </-> uhm <,> uh <=> in </=> </}> the area <,> I had all the

terminology down pat <{> <[> <O> laugh </O> in French </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#142:1:B> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#143:1:A> So <{1> <[1> uh I knew <}> <-> that </-> <=> that </=> </}>

</[1> was somewhat of a unique topic <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> and that by the time

I got in to meet the evaluator he may have already spoken to other students

fifteen or twenty times on <}> <-> sums </-> <=> subjects </=> </}> such as

hockey or uhm <,> baseball uhm or perhaps uhm dance <}> <-> or or </-> <=> or

</=> </}> piano lessons or <{3> <[3> something like that <,> </[3> with other

children

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#144:1:B> <[1> Wow <O> laugh </O> </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#145:1:B> <[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#146:1:B> <[3> Mm hmm mm hmm </[3> </{3>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#147:1:A> And so he'd probably or she'd probably be quite bored <{> <[>

<,> </[> with that particular topic

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#148:1:B> <[> Mm hmm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#149:1:A> And here was this really nice equestrian <{> <[> topic <}>

<-> to to </-> <=> to </=> </}> discuss </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#150:1:B> <[> Mm mm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#151:1:A> And I always bet my bottom dollar that that was <}> <-> gonna

</-> <+> going to </+> </}> work

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#152:1:A> And the other two topics that I picked were usually rather

uninteresting bland <{1> <[1> topics </[1> so then I knew that the <{2> <[2>

equestrian <?> one would </?> be really likely <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-071#153:1:A> <unclear> word </unclear> </[2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#154:1:B> <[1> Mm </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#155:1:B> <[2> Right <O> laugh </O> right <O> laugh </O> </[2> </{2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#156:1:A> And of course <}> <-> <}> <-> I </-> <{1> <[1> <=> I </=>

</}> had the </[1> </-> <=> I had <}> <-> the </-> uhm <=> the </=> </}> </=>

</}> ease <}> <-> and the </-> <=> and the </=> </}> uh comfort zone to be

able to pull it off <.> i </.> with this terminology and so I always got

really good <{2> <[2> grades <,> in </[2> oral communication <{3> <[3> skills

in a second </[3> language

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#157:1:B> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#158:1:B> <[2> <?> That was well planned </?> </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#159:1:B> <[3> Mm hmm </[3> </{3>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#160:1:A> <O> Loud inhale </O> So hopefully our children will be quite

so ingenious <}> <-> and </-> <,> <=> <{> <[> and </=> </}> be able </[> to

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#161:1:B> <[> Well </[> </{> <.> y </.> <.> w </.> <}> <-> on the

street <,> there's a </-> <=> there are a couple of girls up the street </=>

</}> <@> Faye </@> <@> Tina </@> <@> Jennifer </@> and <,> what is really

wonderful is that <,> the doors are opened for <@> Martha </@> whereas some

other kids <,> they can only play <}> <-> with the French <.> ki </.> </-> uh

<=> with the English </=> </}> kids

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#162:1:B> <}> <-> <.> Tha </.> </-> <+> That's </+> </}> all <}> <->

they </-> <=> they </=> </}> feel comfortable with

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#163:1:A> <{1> <[1> Mm hmm </[1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#164:1:B> <[1> But </[1> </{1> the language is a real barrier once you

get up to the age where our kids are around eight <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> years

old <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> so <,> <@> Martha </@> <}> <-> can

</-> <=> can </=> </}> <,> play with the English kids

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#165:1:A> <[2> Mm hmm </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#166:1:B> She can play with the French
<ICE-CAN:S1B-071#167:1:B> And if everybody's out in the street then everybody's out <}> <->

but </-> <=> but </=> </}> it really <,> opens up the world for her to be

able to go <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> play with these kids as well

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#168:1:A> Mm hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#169:1:B> <}> <-> And </-> <=> And </=> </}> so <,> some of the things

that uh <@> Marmaduke </@> was talking about <}> <-> about </-> <,> <=> about

</=> </}> applying it after school <,> uhm become a little less forced

because you just begin at an early age to make friends <,> that are speaking

that other language

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#170:1:B> And <{> <[> <,> </[> little <@> Peter </@> today

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#171:1:A> <[> Mm hmm </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#172:1:B> My <@> Peter </@> wanted to go up and he wants so badly to

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#174:1:B> Up the top of the street is French

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-071#177:1:B> <[> And he wants to go </[> </{> up and play with these
