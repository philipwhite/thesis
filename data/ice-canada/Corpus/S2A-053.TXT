<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-053#1:1:A> And even though <}> <-> <.> Cana </.> Canadian uh <,> </-> <=>

Canadians </=> </}> often seem to mimic <word> Americans' </word> tendencies

<,> Canada has not yet caught up with <,> what is recognized as an American

inclination to sue <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#2:1:A> And I really don't know the law at all so I don't know even if it's

more difficult to sue <,> here or in the rest of Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#3:1:A> But of course every generalization I make about Canada <,> would be

modified by something else about Quebec
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#4:1:A> Because Quebec has <}> <-> a different </-> in many ways <=> a

different </=> </}> legal system it has its own tax system et cetera et

cetera right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#5:1:A> In terms of uh how many people might be around to help you <,> there

are in fact not that many people trained
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#6:1:A> In Montreal <,> the percentage <,> of people trained <,> <}> <-> <.>

wi </.> </-> <=> within </=> </}> the population is <,> not quite one percent

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#7:1:A> One of the best areas I think is the Gasp&eacute; <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#8:1:A> And I have the impression that there there is a lot of training that

there's <}> <-> a lot a a a </-> <=> a serious </=> </}> spirit of training

with uh C P R instructors in the Gasp&eacute;
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#9:1:A> So there are areas in Quebec
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#10:1:A> The highest percentage in Quebec of people trained to do C P R <,>

is two <,> and I think that's in the Gasp&eacute;
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#11:1:A> The lowest is <O> quiet muttering with an extracorpus speaker,

unintelligible </O> <&> Tape stops and starts again </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#12:1:A> And so in Montreal it isn't even one percent
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#13:1:A> Or it's just <,> <}> <-> scuse me </-> <+> excuse me </+> </}> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#14:1:A> No I'm sorry in the Eastern Townships it isn't even one percent
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#15:1:A> In Montreal it's just over one percent
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#16:1:A> So it's very important that you have the remotest clue about what

to do
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#17:1:A> Another statistic that should compel you or motivate you is that

<,> in virtually eighty percent or eight times out of ten that you are in a

position to respond to an emergency you will know the victim
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#18:1:A> So it will be in your home at your workplace in your backyard
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#19:1:A> And this is something to consider if you're worried about

responding because of <,> communicable diseases like hepatitis or AIDS
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#20:1:A> If you compare hepatitis to AIDS <,> hepatitis is highly contagious

<,> and not as lethal as AIDS
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#21:1:A> And of course there are at least <}> <-> a <.> coup </.> </-> <=> a

couple </=> </}> of kinds of hepatitis
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#22:1:A> AIDS on the other hand is hardly contagious <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#23:1:A> <}> <-> <.> Com </.> as </-> <=> As communicable </=> </}> diseases

go <,> AIDS is very noncontagious <,> but it's very lethal <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#24:1:A> So whether you're trying to protect yourself from <,> a cold or

hepatitis or anything else <,> if you are <,> taking this seriously it's very

easy to acquire a pocket mask
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#25:1:A> And every area that has a responder in the university is supposed

to have a pocket mask
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#26:1:A> If you have any questions about equipment then you should call the

safety office and talk to <@> Natasha </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#27:1:A> But for your own self too you can check around and get pocket masks

for your own first aid kit
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#28:1:A> I have one in my car

<$ZA> <ICE-CAN:S2A-053#29:1:Z> <O> makes a comment </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-053#30:1:A> That's right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#31:1:A> There are different kinds you can get <,> there are many many

barriers
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#32:1:A> The manufacturers in recent years have made a killing on barrier

production
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#33:1:A> Whereas a decade ago you would have to look <}> <-> high and </->

<=> far and wide </=> </}> to find a pocket mask for Joe Public
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#34:1:A> Now Joe Public can get all kinds <}> <-> of </-> <=> of </=> </}>

barriers
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#35:1:A> And <}> <-> there </-> <=> there </=> </}> are little ones that are

disposable that just come in a sterile package and you tear them open and

what it amounts to is a rectangle of plastic with a little piece of uhm <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#36:1:A> And <}> <-> in </-> <=> if </=> </}> worse comes to worse and

you're there feeling uh vulnerable but still interested in responding <,>

then even if you use <}> <-> some </-> <=> some </=> </}> cloth
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#37:1:A> Any kind of fabric can <}> <-> present <.> pre </.> </-> <=>

present </=> </}> somewhat of a barrier <,> not a complete one by any means
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#38:1:A> Alright
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#39:1:A> Does anyone have any questions
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#40:1:A> So now that <@> Liz </@> has rescued <@> Amanda </@> I would like

<@> Liz </@> to be a victim and I would like each of you to go through the

little torture of recognizing an emergency <,> doing the assessment and <,>

okay going as far as you can
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#41:1:A> So who's next <&> Tape stops and starts again </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-053#42:1:A> One one thousand two one thousand et cetera
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#43:1:A> Get comfortable with it right away <,> this response <,> this

little scenario is the most important part of the course
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#44:1:A> I will get a <unclear> two words </unclear> in <,> you will do the

Heimlich manoeuver but this assessment <,> and your <O> coughing in audience

starts </O> willingness to overcome <O> coughing in audience ends </O> your

own confusion and <,> awkwardness is the most important part of the course

<$ZB> <ICE-CAN:S2A-053#45:1:Z> <O> Starts to ask a question </O> <&> Tape stops and starts

again </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-053#46:1:A> Would have been covered in the first C S S T <&> Commission de

la Sant&eacute; et de la Securit&eacute; au Travail </&> course that you did
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#47:1:A> You probably learned to disturb the person as little as possible

<,> stabilize them as much as possible <,> that's for physical injuries <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#48:1:A> Always stop the bleeding first
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#49:1:A> So even if you see this person collapsed here <,> they may have no

uh broken legs or limbs or sprains or strains <,> but if you notice an

arterial bleed then of course you have to stop that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#50:1:A> Does anybody remember anything about stopping bleeding <&> Tape

stops and starts again </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-053#51:1:A> <@> Christine </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#52:1:A> <@> Christine </@> or <@> Christina </@>

<$ZC> <ICE-CAN:S2A-053#53:1:Z> <O> Extracorpus speaker responds </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-053#54:1:A> I have a niece named <@> Christine </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#55:1:A> If I came along here and <@> Christine </@> had a big cut in her

arm
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#56:1:A> She may be unconscious she may be unconscious because she is

bleeding or she may be unconscious for other reasons but a serious bleed is

one where you can see the bleeding <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#57:1:A> The blood is appearing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#58:1:A> <}> <-> You don't have to </-> <=> Nobody has to </=> </}> quantify

exactly whether it's a spurting gush or anything like that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#59:1:A> A serious bleed is where you can see the blood increasing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#60:1:A> And the first thing you have to do is try and stop the bleeding <,>

with pressure and elevation right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#61:1:A> If there are two of us that would be great if I could sit here with

the arm raised putting pressure on the wound
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#62:1:A> Ideally I would have a bandage under my hand but if not this is <,>

helpful
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#63:1:A> Within a few minutes <,> the bleeding can slow at least
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#64:1:A> <}> <-> It may never </-> Depending on where it's cut <=> it may

never </=> </}> be completely stopped without <,> some pressure on it <,> but

if you slow the bleeding that will help a lot
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#65:1:A> And <}> <-> for many many </-> <=> whether it's </=> </}> a small

bleed or a big bleed there are physiological things that happen to stop it

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#66:1:A> <}> <-> They </-> <=> The </=> </}> stuff that clots <,> a bleed

<}> <-> if if </-> <=> if </=> </}> the blood keeps spurting out and washing

it away then there's no chance for clotting to occur
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#67:1:A> So that helps too
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#68:1:A> Pressure slows it down <,> elevation makes it harder for the blood

to go up against gravity <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#69:1:A> <}> <-> So that's <,> if you just </-> <=> So you don't </=> </}>

have to have a first aid kit with you to stop a bleed
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#70:1:A> And you don't have to memorize a first aid course to do that kind

of thing <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#71:1:A> You have to just think I have to slow or stop the bleeding <,> by

putting pressure on the wound and raising the member if it involves a leg or

an arm
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#72:1:A> There are some bleeds you can't raise so then you put pressure
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#73:1:A> Okay <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#74:1:A> So <}> <-> that's the only </-> <=> that's the only </=> </}> first

aid you worry about in this approach in this assessment <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#75:1:A> And if you see broken bones <,> if you see any kind of other damage

<,> the first assessment involves breathing <,> et cetera <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#76:1:A> So <}> <-> a <.> f </.> a a first </-> <=> a comprehensive first

aid </=> </}> approach always involves a primary and secondary survey which

was probably mentioned in your first aid course
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#77:1:A> So the primary survey is always is this person conscious <,> are

they breathing do they have a pulse
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#78:1:A> The secondary survey is <,> do they have a broken foot do they have

a broken arm do they have broken ribs
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#79:1:A> So <}> <-> if you discovered </-> <=> if you couldn't help but

notice </=> </}> that there were broken bones you would have to do the

primary survey first
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#80:1:A> And if you discovered that this person needed C P R you would have

to do C P R

<$ZD> <ICE-CAN:S2A-053#81:1:Z> <O> asks a question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-053#82:1:A> The consequence
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#83:1:A> <}> <-> This </-> <=> This </=> </}> brings me into a description

of death <,> as it involves sudden death <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#84:1:A> If someone for whatever reason suddenly becomes unconscious <}> <->

or suddenly </-> <=> and or suddenly </=> </}> stops breathing <,> and or

suddenly has no more pulse <,,> when they collapse and are <,> breathless and

pulseless <,> this is called sudden death
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#85:1:A> It means that they weren't sick sicker sickest and finally expired

<,> it means that they suddenly collapsed breathless and pulseless
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#86:1:A> For a few minutes <,> their <,> status is described as being

clinically dead <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#87:1:A> Which means that <,> they're not breathing and they have no pulse
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#88:1:A> That's what clicincal death means <,> no breath no pulse <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#89:1:A> If someone intervenes either with basic life support <,> or

advanced life support <,> artificial breathing and circulation can be

provided
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#90:1:A> And that will stabilize the situation that they're in
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#91:1:A> And possibly this person can be reanimated <,> and can recover from

sudden death
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#92:1:A> If the person remains clinically dead for a period of time that is

with no breathing and no circulation <,> there will be organ and tissue

damage <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#93:1:A> When the brain is damaged enough the death will be irreversible <,>

and this is biological death
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#94:1:A> Brain death is biological death <,> and this is not reversible
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#95:1:A> And finally if someone who has the authority to do so checks out

the victim and says I declare them legally dead this is usually a doctor <,>

then that is legal death
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#96:1:A> So of course there are people who are dead who are not legally dead

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#97:1:A> There have been enough cases of people who were not dead to have

been declared legally dead
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#98:1:A> But the only one that involves you <,> is clinical death <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#99:1:A> And the only assessment you can make <,> following the A B Cs is is

this person breathing <,> is their heart beating
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#100:1:A> And so that's all you have to know <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#101:1:A> That's all you ever have to know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#102:1:A> And anyone can check a pulse and anyone can check breathing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#103:1:A> And you can and if you do and discover that the person has no

pulse and no breath
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#104:1:A> Unless its cause could hurt you too <,> it doesn't matter why they

collapsed <,> or how <,> and it doesn't matter how long they've been

collapsed as long as you can do the assessment and try to respond <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#105:1:A> And there's more than just a physical inability to respond that

can impede you sometimes
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#106:1:A> It could be an emotional a mental other type of physical inability

exhaustion or something
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#107:1:A> If ever you're in a position where you are alone to respond <,>

such as with <}> <-> the the </-> <=> the </=> </}> people who sleep on park

benches and on a regular basis <?> need attention </?> <,,> you just have to

do your best
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#108:1:A> And if your best doesn't involve <,> checking and rubbing his

airway then your best should involve calling for help
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#109:1:A> You know you in the end have to be the person who decides what to

do <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#110:1:A> <}> <-> D'ya </-> <+> Did you </+> </}> have a good rest here <O>

laughs with audience </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#111:1:A> Are you ready to rescue somebody <&> Tape stops and starts again

</&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#112:1:A> Walked up to them going no no <unclear> word </unclear>

unconscious
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#113:1:A> To see how clearly people breathe
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#114:1:A> So trust that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#115:1:A> Another thing is that if you breathe for someone <}> <-> they

won't </-> uh <=> if they don't </=> </}> need your mouth to mouth it won't

hurt them
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#116:1:A> Of course if you do C P R and they don't need it <,> it will hurt

them
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#117:1:A> Don't worry about giving someone mouth to mouth if you're not a

hundred percent sure that they need it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#118:1:A> You just have to make sure that you can find a pulse or not and

that's why you should try as much as possible to find everybody's pulse here

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-053#125:1:A> It's a good idea to give just enough air to see the chest

rise and not more

</&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-053#127:1:A> In the initial assessment it has to be very stepwise
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#128:1:A> Tilt the airway <,> check the breathing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#129:1:A> If there's no breathing start mouth to mouth with two breaths <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#130:1:A> Once you do get the two breaths in check the pulse
<ICE-CAN:S2A-053#131:1:A> Show me how you would do that

<$ZG> <ICE-CAN:S2A-053#132:1:Z> <O> asks a question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-053#133:1:A> It is recommended that you check it on your side <,> to avoid

pressing down on the windpipe and both carotid arteries </I>
