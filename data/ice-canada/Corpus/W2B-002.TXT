<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#1:1> <h> The Niagara shoot </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#2:1> Jock Carroll got the assignment of a lifetime when he was sent to

photograph Marilyn Monroe on the set of Niagara.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#3:1> She wasn't at all what he'd expected ... </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#4:1> It was over forty years ago on Thursday, June 5, 1952.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#5:1> Harry Truman was president, the Cold War had escalated into the Korean

War, the United States had set off its first nuclear bomb, and the popular

songs of the year were " Kisses Sweeter Than Wine" and Hoagy Carmichael's

version of " In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening". </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#6:1> I was about to have lunch with Marilyn Monroe.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#7:1> A few days earlier, Marilyn had descended on Niagara Falls, Ontario,

with a film crew of sixty, which included the actors Joseph Cotten, Jean

Peters, and Casey Adams, and the famous director Henry Hathaway.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#8:1> They had come to make the film Niagara. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#9:1> At my elbow a chubby film publicity man named Frank Neill was on

the phone to Marilyn, arranging a lunch for the Rainbow Room in the General

Brock Hotel overlooking the Falls. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#10:1> I heard him say, " All right, honey.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#11:1> He's here to do a photo spread for Weekend Magazine.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#12:1> That's the biggest publication in Canada.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#13:1> Fine, honey.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#14:1> We'll wait for you at the top of the elevator." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#15:1> Hanging up, Neill turned to me.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#16:1> " She says she'll come right up.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#17:1> But that may mean one hour or two hours."
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#18:1> He shook his head.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#19:1> " God knows what she'll be wearing.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#20:1> Here's somebody who's potentially one of the richest women in

Hollywood, and she's arrived here with practically no clothes.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#21:1> No clothes, but lots of books.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#22:1> Still, she handles herself well." - </p> <O> untranscribed text </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#23:1> " Apart from that, I don't go out to nightclubs.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#24:1> I don't go out much at all — even to premieres.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#25:1> The studio made a fuss when I wouldn't go to the premiere of All

About Eve.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#26:1> They said it was a must.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#27:1> But they got over it.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#28:1> Sometimes, after putting in a good day's work, I can enjoy a glass of

wine with friends.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#29:1> But I can't force myself into that sort of thing.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#30:1> And of course I read a lot."
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#31:1> " What are you reading now?"
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#32:1> " I'm reading The Thinking Body by Mabel Ellsworth Todd.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#33:1> And I've just finished Letters to a Young Poet by Rainer Maria Rilke.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#34:1> I read The Prophet.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#35:1> And I love Whitman and Thomas Wolfe."
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#36:1> She looked at me.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#37:1> " What do you think of Wolfe?"
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#38:1> Flustered, I replied, " Well, I think he's a great subjective writer.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#39:1> Maybe somewhat undisciplined.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#40:1> I read that he turns in million-word manuscripts and that his editor,

Maxwell Perkins, has to cut them in half in order to get them to book size"
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#41:1> " You'd understand all that," said Marilyn, " if you read his book

How to Write a Novel.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#42:1> I've just finished it. " </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#43:1> Perhaps thinking that I would get lost in literature, Neill

addressed a question to Marilyn.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#44:1> " Is it true what you said to Hathaway about the calendar?" Marilyn

laughed.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#45:1> " Yes, it's true.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#46:1> But it wasn't Hathaway."
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#47:1> She explained to me.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#48:1> " They keep asking if it's true I had nothing on when I posed for

that calendar nude.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#49:1> Yesterday I said, ` Oh, no.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#50:1> I had the radio on'." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#51:1> We all laughed.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#52:1> I asked, " If it wasn't Hathaway, who was it?"
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#53:1> " It doesn't matter," said Marilyn.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#54:1> " If you want to use it, give it to Hathaway."
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#55:1> She went on.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#56:1> " Funny how shocked people in Hollywood were when they learned I'd

posed in the nude.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#57:1> At one time I'd always said no when photographers asked me.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#58:1> But you'll do it when you get hungry enough.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#59:1> It was at a time when I didn't seem to have much future.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#60:1> I had no job and no money for the rent.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#61:1> I was living in the Hollywood Studio Club for Girls.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#62:1> I told them I'd get the rent somehow.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#63:1> So I phoned up Tom Kelley, and he took these two colour shots — one

sitting up, the other lying down.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#64:1> I didn't think I'd done anything wrong.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#65:1> His wife, Natalie, was there during the shooting.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#66:1> I earned the fifty dollars that I needed.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#67:1> But people were shocked when they recognized me." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#68:1> The nude photo for which Marilyn was paid fifty dollars was sold

by the photographer for

$500. <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#69:1> The calendar manufacturer was reported to have made a million

dollars when the calendar caught on. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#70:1> Marilyn's lunch was interrupted by a procession of auto <l> graph

hounds who pushed bits of paper and menus almost in her face.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#71:1> Marilyn obliged with a smile, but she observed in an aside, " I look

forward to the day when I'll be free of all this."
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#72:1> She added sombrely, " And perhaps free of depression." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#73:1> As it was becoming almost impossible to talk, Neill called for

the check and we left the Rainbow Room. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#74:1> For the next several days I dogged Marilyn's footsteps around the

set of Niagara with a couple of Leica cameras around my neck.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#75:1> Picture opportunities were few but I came to be accepted as part of

the scenery by the crew and, more importantly, by Marilyn. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#76:1> One afternoon I accompanied her on a publicity tour put on for

local officials.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#77:1> She made presentations, posed for group photos, and did a dutiful

tour of a local factory.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#78:1> Marilyn brightened up my factory photos by loosening the straps of

her blouse, leaning over a piece of machinery to give my camera a good view

of her breasts, and flashing her best smile. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#79:1> Another day Neill arrived at my room with news.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#80:1> " Marilyn isn't shooting today," he said, " and she says she'll go

out with you for colour shots after she's through with her hairdresser and

make-up man." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#81:1> On our way to Marilyn's room, Neill said, " She likes you.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#82:1> Because you're taking time to get to know her."
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#83:1> Neill seemed to think this was cleverness on my part, whereas it was

simply my lack of experience. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#84:1> After the hairdresser and Neill departed for other duties, I was

left with Marilyn and her make-up man, Whitey, who went to work on Marilyn's

face.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#85:1> Some time later the phone rang.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#86:1> " It's New York calling," said Marilyn.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#87:1> Whitey and I knew this meant Joe DiMaggio so we discreetly withdrew

to the hotel corridor. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#88:1> Whitey liked Marilyn and began talking about her.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#89:1> " She takes life pretty seriously.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#90:1> Have you noticed while she's sitting around on the set, she always

has a script in her hands?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#91:1> Well, she's not studying her lines.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#92:1> No, she has one of those deep soul books hidden in the script.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#93:1> Rilke, Franck, Freud, or maybe Emerson.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#94:1> She finds something in a book she thinks is true and she writes

herself a little note about it.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#95:1> You know, ` You don't save souls in bunches,' or, 'All life is a road

of discovery leading to yourself."
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#96:1> That sort of thing" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#97:1> " She wants to be right, all the time.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#98:1> They don't have much of a life, you know.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#99:1> Reporters or photographers all the time.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#100:1> If they go out in public, a crowd gathers.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#101:1> I wouldn't want it." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#102:1> Marilyn let us back into her room and began skipping about like

a little girl.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#103:1> " I'm going to New York for the weekend!" she cried.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#104:1> " If Hathaway will let me!" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#105:1> She put in a call to the director and, while waiting for him to

call back, ran around the room picking up clothes and a little hat and

holding them against her while she examined her <l> self in the mirror. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#106:1> She groaned.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#107:1> " I haven't got a thing with me — just slacks and a skirt.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#108:1> When they said Canada, I thought it would be up in the mountains

somewhere.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#109:1> Jean Peters lent me this suit — but it doesn't fit around the hips,

does it?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#110:1> Maybe Wardrobe will have something." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#111:1> The phone rang. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#112:1> She dumped the clothes on the bed and grabbed the phone, talking

excitedly.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#113:1> She made another call.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#114:1> She talked more, her voice gradually rising. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#115:1> When she put down the phone, she said, " They're passing the

buck.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#116:1> Hathaway says I can leave if the unit manager says I can.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#117:1> The unit manager says it's all right with him, but Hathaway will

have to take the responsibility.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#118:1> Neither of them will.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#119:1> And they promised before that I could go if I didn't have scenes

coming up." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#120:1> She sat down and Whitey began working on her face again.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#121:1> " Whitey," she asked, " do you think I'm being unreasonable?"
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#122:1> Whitey shook his head. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#123:1> " Don't say so," said Marilyn, " if you think I am.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#124:1> I haven't had any time off for the past four pictures." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#125:1> " I don't think you're unreasonable," Whitey replied.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#126:1> " But, on the other hand, I didn't think they'd let you go, either.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#127:1> If the weather's bad tomorrow, they'll have to shoot indoors and

they'll need you." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#128:1> Marilyn went to the phone again.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#129:1> " I'll have to put in another call to Joe and tell him they won't

let me come." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#130:1> When the call came through Whitey and I trooped outside once

more, but this time we could hear her voice through the door - </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#131:1> " But darling!
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#132:1> They won't let me come!
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#133:1> Don't you understand?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#134:1> Don't you believe me, darling?"
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#135:1> Her voice was distraught.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#136:1> " But Joe – " </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#137:1> The call ended abruptly as though Joe had slammed down the

phone.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#138:1> It was a long ten-minute wait before Marilyn opened her door again.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#139:1> Her eyes were wet and her mascara had run. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#140:1> She sat down in front of the mirror and looked at herself.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#141:1> She managed a kind of smile.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#142:1> " I'm sorry, Whitey, but I guess you'll have to do my eyes over

again."
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#143:1> By the time Whitey had repaired her face the afternoon had almost

gone, but Marilyn said we should take our planned drive.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#144:1> It was a beautiful sunny afternoon and I drove around the Niagara

peninsula looking for a haystack.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#145:1> I had some naive idea that I need <l> ed one as a backdrop for a

colour photo.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#146:1> We couldn't find a haystack and in retrospect I realize I should

have just stopped anywhere and photographed her against a rail fence, a barn,

a field of grain.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#147:1> She didn't need a backdrop. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#148:1> After a while I looked over and saw that Marilyn had fallen

asleep, curled up in the front seat beside me.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#149:1> I didn't have the heart to pursue the project any more that day and

drove her back to the hotel.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#150:1> She walked barefoot up the front steps of the hotel, carrying her

shoes in her hand.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#151:1> I grabbed a shot of that. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#152:1> When I had parked my car and returned, the hotel doorman called

me over.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#153:1> He was almost beside himself with delight.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#154:1> " When you let her out of your car and she came in barefoot, - she

stopped in front of my desk to put on her shoes.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#155:1> When she bent over <it> one of them fell right out! </it> "
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#156:1> The doorman, at least, had had a good day. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#157:1> Later that evening Neill caught up with me.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#158:1> " Well," he asked, " have you or haven't you?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#159:1> You have to admit I gave you every opportunity today."
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#160:1> I began to explain that it hadn't been that kind of day, but he

thought I was evading the question and interrupted me. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#161:1> " Okay," he said, " you're not going to talk.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#162:1> Probably just as well.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#163:1> A good friend of mine with Associated Press was banging Rita

Hayworth regularly.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#164:1> When Zanuck [ head of 20th Century-Fox] found out, he had him barred

from the lot.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#165:1> Permanently.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#166:1> How did you do for pictures?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#167:1> " Two grab shots," I said.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#168:1> " One trying on Jean Peters's clothes.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#169:1> The other of her walking barefoot up the steps of the hotel."
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#170:1> " Well, better luck next time," said Neill.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#171:1> " We'll see when she's free again." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#172:1> I was having some success in getting candid shots of Marilyn

around the set over the next few days, but little success in setting up a

session for a colour cover.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#173:1> It depended on her shooting schedule and sufficient time for her

hairdresser and make-up man to prepare her for colour close-ups. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-002#174:1> And there was her tendency to be late for appointments. <O> rest

of paragraph </O> </p>

<p> <O> text missing </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#175:1> " The secret of a base," she said, " is to take most of it off.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#176:1> <X> That's where most women go wrong."
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#X177:1> She applied witch hazel, then patted herself with tissue.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#X178:1> " See?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-002#X179:1> I'm taking most of it off." </X> </p> </I>
