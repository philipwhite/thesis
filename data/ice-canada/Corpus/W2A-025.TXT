<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#13:1> <h> <bold> Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-025#14:1> Vegetation associations and habitat gradients have been

determined from a few wetland complexes in the Canadian Arctic ( Muc 1977;

Vitt and Pakarinen 1977; Sheard and Geale 1983; Miller and Alpert 1984) and

from several complexes in the low and mid-boreal ( see Kenkel 1987) wetland

regions, as mapped by the National Wetlands Working Group ( 1986).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#15:1> Comparable studies are rare in the subarctic and high boreal wetland

regions, which include the most extensive peat deposits of North America.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#16:1> Permafrost influences the develop <l> ment and morphology of wetlands

( Zoltai and Tarnocai 1975) in these regions, which include the zone of

discontinuous permafrost and the southern fringe of the continuous perma <l>

frost zone ( Brown 1977).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#17:1> Polygonal peat plateaux, peat plateaux, and patterned fens

characterize subarctic wetlands.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#18:1> Permafrost underlies all wetlands but shoreline fens in the high

subarctic, but is absent from patterned fens in the low subarctic ( National

Wetlands Working Group 1986). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-025#19:1> A peatland project in northern Yukon Territory provided a chance

to describe several sites in a large wetland complex of the high subarctic

wetland region.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#20:1> This paper provides a floristic and structural description of these

wetlands and relates them to other reports of wetland vegetation in

northwestern North America. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#21:1> <h> <bold> Study area </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-025#22:1> Two large old lake basins occur near the village of Old Crow,

about 150 km south of the Beaufort Sea ( Fig. 1).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#23:1> Glacial meltwater deposited a thick bed of grey clay during the Late

Wisconsinan stadial and finally drained away by 12 000 years BP ( Matthews et

al. 1987).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#24:1> Today the basins are poorly drained expanses of patterned peatland

and shallow thermokarst lakes.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#25:1> Shoreline erosion is active in many lakes.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#26:1> Regional treeline is just north of the Old Crow Flats.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#27:1> Mean July and January temperatures at Old Crow are 14.2 and -

33.1&degree;C, respectively, and mean annual temperature is - 10.1&degree;C.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#28:1> Mean annual precipitation is 215 mm ( Environment Canada 1982).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#29:1> The mean annual number of thawing degree-days is about 1900 ( Burns

1973).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#30:1> The area lies within the southernmost part of the continuous perma

<l> frost zone ( Brown 1977). </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#31:1> <h> <bold> Methods </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-025#32:1> In July of 1979 and 1981, field studies were carried out by the

first author.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#33:1> The second author identified most moss collections, except for

<foreign> <it> Sphagnum </it> </foreign> specimens, which were identified by

D. H. Vitt, Uni <l> versity of Alberta.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#34:1> Voucher specimens of the mosses are deposited at Memorial University

and the Univesity of Alberta. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-025#35:1> At each vegetation site, the percent cover of each species was

esti <l> mated within an area of 50 - 100 m <sp> 2 </sp> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#36:1> In fields of low-centre polygons, separate species lists were

compiled for the wet centres and dry ridges of the polygons.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#37:1> Mosses that could not be identified in the field were characterized

and collected: as a check, several handfuls of moss were gathered at random

throughout the site and later identified. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-025#38:1> Three habitat variables at each site were measured: pH ( using

narrow range dual strip test paper), depth to frost table, and depth of peat

( defined as material with loss-on-ignition greater than 80%).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#39:1> Water pH at each site was tested, either in a polygon trough, between

tussocks, in an adjacent pool, or as seepage into a soil pit.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#40:1> To convert depth to frost table to a less date-dependent estimate of

active layer depth, 0.2 cm was added to the measurement for each day before

August 1 that it was made.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#41:1> Since rate of thaw is highly dependent on moisture conditions at a

site ( Brown 1977: Ryden and Kostov 1980), this estimate of active-layer

depth is an index of the relative wetness of each site.<O> map </O> <O> map

caption </O> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-025#42:1> Estimates of percent cover were obtained for 65 vascular and 70

moss taxa noted from 74 vegetation sites.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#43:1> This data set was condensed by removing taxa that occurred in two

sites or less, and by grouping species within some genera.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#44:1> Structure in the resulting data set, of 50 vascular and 39

nonvascular taxa, was explored by ordination ( detrended correspondence

analysis, DECORANA ) and classification ( two-way indicator species analysis,

TWINSPAN ) procedures. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#45:1> <h> <bold> Results </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-025#46:1> The first axis of the ordination reflects a strong moisture gra

<l> dient ( Fig. 2), indicated by a high correlation ( <it> r </it> = 0.79)

of stand score on this axis with active-layer depth.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#47:1> At all but two of the sites ( 27, 30) with scores over 100 on the

first axis, the water table occurred at or above the vegetation surface. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-025#48:1> The second axis is significantly correlated with peat depth (

<it> r </it> = - 0.44, <it> p </it> &lt; 0.05).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#49:1> Sites with a mineral substrate have high scores on this axis and

include species that are early colonizers of drained lakebeds on the arctic

coast ( Ovenden 1986): <foreign> <it> Arctophila fulva, Calamagrostis

canadensis, Arcta <l> grostis latifolia, Equisetum arvense </it> </foreign> ,

and <foreign> <it> Stellaria longipes </it> </foreign> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#50:1> The distribution of ice wedge polygons is also related to peat depth

( all sites with &gt; 80 cm peat have polygonal patterns).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#51:1> Consequently, most sites that lack distinct ice wedge polygons have

high scores on the second axis. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-025#52:1> Although pH is an imperfect index of dissolved nutrients in fen

waters ( Sj&ouml;rs 1983), it is closely related to the vegetational gradient

poor fen - rich fen ( Sj&ouml;rs 1983) and may be linked to trophic status (

Pakarinen and Ruuhij&auml;rvi 1978).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#53:1> The pH of the Old Crow sites varies from 4.2-5.8; this gradient is

signifi <l> cantly correlated with both the first axis ( <it> r </it> = 0.46)

and second axis ( <it> r </it> = 0.41) of the vegetation ordination.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#54:1> Sites with low pH and species characteristic of poor fens and

oligotrophic mires in Scandinavia ( Sj&ouml;rs 1983; Pakarinen and

Ruuhij&auml;rvi 1978) have low scores on both the first and second axes,

while sites with pH &gt; 5.0 and species typical of more minerotrophic mires

have high scores. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-025#55:1> In boreal regions, <foreign> <it> Scorpidium scorpioides,

Calliergon tri <l> farium, Campylium stellatum </foreign> </it> , and

<foreign> <it> Tomenthypnum nitens </foreign> </it> , are indicators of rich

fens ( pH &gt; 5.8; Sj&ouml;rs 1950, 1983), but these species grow profusely

and commonly in the study area at a pH of 5.0-5.6.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#56:1> This phenomenon has also been observed on nutrient-deficient

peatlands of the Soviet tundra zone ( Botch and Masing 1983). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-025#57:1> TWINSPAN identified seven physiognomic vegetation types ( Table

1).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#58:1> Observations of aquatic vegetation in lakes of the region will be

provided first, followed by descriptions of the seven vegetation types. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#59:1> <h> <it> Thermokarst lakes near Old Crow </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-025#60:1> Most of these lakes are 2-3m deep ( Matthews et al. 1987) with a

pH of 5.0-5.6.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#61:1> Some support <foreign> <it> Nuphar polysepalum </it> </foreign> (

especially in the Bluefish Basin and southern half of the Old Crow Flats) and

more rarely, <foreign> <it> Ceratophyllum demersum </it> </foreign> ( Cwynar

1983).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#62:1> A large shallow lake in the western Old Crow Flats ( XV on Fig. 1) is

mostly 65 cm deep with 5-40% cover of <foreign> <it> Potamogeton richardsonii

</it> </foreign> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#63:1> Within 100 m of its shore, at the same depth, <foreign> <it>

<l> mogeton cf. Berchtoldii, Hippuris vulgaris, Myriophyllum spicatum, and

<foreign> <it> Callitriche hermaphroditica </it> </foreign> are abundant.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#64:1> Oospores of <foreign> <it> Chara </it> </foreign> or <foreign> <it>

Ovenden 1985). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-025#66:1> Each of the three sites studied is a band of marshy vegetation

growing in up to 65 cm of water in silty sediment.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#67:1> <foreign> <it> Arctophila fulva </it> </foreign> and <foreign> <it>

Carex aquatilis </it> </foreign> are the dominant vascular taxa. Loose,

</foreign> are also important.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#68:1> <foreign> <it> Ranunculus trichophyllus, R. gmelinii, Eleocharis

</foreign> , which occur as seeds in nearshore sedi <l> ments of the lakes (

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-025#70:1> These sites consist of scattered low shrubs in a moderately dense

sward of rhizomatous sedges and cottongrass.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#71:1> The moss cover is almost continuous and occurs in semisubmersed,

floating, and soft cushion forms.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#72:1> Four species were found at all five sites in this group: <foreign>

<it> Andromedia polifolia, Chamaedaphne calyculata, Carex aquatilis </it>

<foreign> <it> Drepanocladus </it> </foreign> and <foreign> <it> Sphagnum

<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#74:1> Of the five sites in this group, two occurred in recent meander

swales of the Old Crow River, one bordered a small pond, and two formed broad

<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#83:1> Frozen substrate occurred 39 - 58 cm beneath eight of the sites, but

none was found ( within 80 cm) at the remaining three sites.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#84:1> The pH ranged from 5.0 - 5.8 except at site 54, where it was 4.4.

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-025#86:1> All sites in this group are low-centre polygons.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#87:1> At most, the vegetation is a diffuse lawn of sedges and dwarf shrubs

in a floating moss mat, with an active layer of 46 - 56 cm.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#88:1> Site 9 is firmer.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#89:1> Common to all six sites are <foreign> <it> Carex rotundata, Andro <l>

<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#94:1> Most are acidic ( pH = 4.4), with a shallow active layer.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#95:1> At some sites ( 39, 40, 49, 56, 60, 66), the peat is over 1.5 m deep

<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#96:1> The younger, shallower peat deposits are indistinctly polygonal or

lack ice wedges.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#97:1> Low shrubs and mosses generally predominate, although most of the

ground cover is ericaceous litter and lichens at the drier sites.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-025#98:1> The peat forms a firm, even ground surface and sedge tussocks are not
