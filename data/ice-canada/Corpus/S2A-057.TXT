<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#1:1:A> Someone else is working with <,> <}> <-> top of the <.> l </.>

</-> <=> top of the line </=> </}> high speed Zeiss lenses with a very good

<,> sixteen or super sixteen camera and you can just say okay well I'll get

second unit images and mount their lenses to your camera and run off
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#2:1:A> And the way it's been designed is to be held like this <,> right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#3:1:A> So it's very good <,> for handheld stuff <,> you know

<$ZA> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#4:1:Z> <O> asks a question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#5:1:A> You can reserve it for your class projects

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#7:1:A> <}> <-> Kay </-> <+> Okay </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#8:1:A> I've spoken to <@> Bob </@> I told him I was showing you this camera

and <,> two students ran <}> <-> outta </-> <+> out of </+> </}> here from

this morning <,> and booked it for two days each <,> because they <,> liked

the flexibility of this camera better than this
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#9:1:A> This is a good camera <,> without a doubt
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#10:1:A> It's just that <,> there have been so many modifications to <,> the

sixteen <}> <-> mil </-> <+> millimetre </+> </}> synch camera over the last

<,> forty years <,> that <,> I mean there's no point <,> in using this

outside of the university
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#11:1:A> In the university <,> if you're using black and white film or

colour films <,> great camera
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#12:1:A> The lenses are sharp there's no problem it's just you <}> <-> gotta

</-> <+> have got to </+> </}> fight <,> to keep it quiet

<$ZB> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#13:1:Z> <O> asks a question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#14:1:A> It's hard to say like I mean there are preferences right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#15:1:A> I mean what I've worked with more is Arri cameras
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#16:1:A> So I like Arri cameras better
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#17:1:A> I like the loading system and the mechanisms
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#18:1:A> <=> But </=> </}> <,> <}> <-> though if </-> <,> the Eclair is

better for handheld than this camera <,> without a doubt
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#19:1:A> <}> <-> <.> Th </.> </-> <=> This </=> </}> camera is <,> heavy and

it's awkward compared to the Eclair

<$ZB> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#20:1:Z> <O> asks a question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#21:1:A> This one yeah
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#22:1:A> Cos this one can hold a four hundred foot <}> <-> mag </-> <+>

magazine </+> </}> <,> and it can also run on daylight spools
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#23:1:A> So I mean <,> it's completely flexible

<$ZB> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#24:1:Z> <O> asks a question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#25:1:A> On this
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#26:1:A> <}> <-> This </-> <=> This </=> </}> does have <,> a <?> barney

</?> <,> <}> <-> kay </-> <+> okay </+> </}> which is a jacket for it

<$ZB> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#27:1:Z> <O> comments </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#28:1:A> The <?> barney </?> does <,,> nothing <O> laughter from

audience </O>

<$ZB> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#29:1:Z> <O> asks a question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#30:1:A> Nothing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#31:1:A> What really works well for this camera <,> is a down blanket and a

leather jacket <,> and two sound blankets <{> <[> <,,> </[> over the camera

operator and the <unclear> word </unclear>

<$ZB> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#32:1:Z> <[> <O> comments </O> </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#33:1:Z> And then <,> you use these clips <,> <}> <-> to to </-> <=> to </=>

</}> keep everything together
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#34:1:Z> Then underneath <,> the camera once you've got the camera covered

what happens is the sound goes down
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#35:1:Z> And in Montreal we have concrete floors <,> and we have hardwood

floors
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#36:1:Z> And if you know anything about <,> sound it's very good for <}> <->

reverb </-> <+> reverberations </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#37:1:Z> Which means that the boom operators point the boom down <,> as

they're taught in this university <,> to record the sound <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#38:1:Z> They're not only <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> get the

voice <,> of the actor but they're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}>

get the sound of the camera bouncing off the floor and echoing back into the

mic

<$ZC> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#39:1:Z> <O> asks a question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#40:1:A> What you do is <,> in the crotch of the tripod <,> right

underneath the uh screw where you level it <,> put another sound bracket <,>

<}> <-> kay </-> <+> okay </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#41:1:A> So really what you need is <,> depending on how of an enclosed

space right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#42:1:A> If you're outside and you're on a telephoto lens <,> you don't need

anything

<$ZC> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#43:1:Z> <O> comments </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#44:1:A> But if you're at this distance <,> and there you're the

soundman at a distance of three and a half feet <&> pronounced 'freet' </&>

from my gate <,> he's <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> have a heart

attack trying to get any <}> <-> kinda </-> <+> kind of </+> </}> sound
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#45:1:A> And then you're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> be

throwing a lot of sound blankets <,> on it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#46:1:A> But you've <}> <-> gotta </-> <+> got to </+> </}> remember to put

one underneath <,> to prevent the sound from bouncing down <,> <}> <-> kay

</-> <+> okay </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#47:1:A> And like that it's fine
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#48:1:A> Like that it works well
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#49:1:A> When I shot with this there was no camera noise but we <,> spent a

lot of time <,> in the first four hours of the shoot <,> trying to figure out

how to stop the sound <O> loud door opening and closing </O> <}> <-> kay </->

<+> okay </+> </}> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#50:1:A> <}> <-> Kay </-> <+> Okay </+> </}> <,> now I'll show you the

insides of these cameras
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#51:1:A> The loop <,> on this camera is far easier <O> loud scraping noise

</O> <,> to load than the Arri S
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#52:1:A> But the magazine is the opposite
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#53:1:A> So I mean they're both similar <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#54:1:A> <}> <-> Kay </-> <+> Okay </+> </}> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#55:1:A> To open the camera <,> right here by the door <,> <}> <-> the </->

<=> is </=> </}> where the eyepiece is
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#56:1:A> This silver <,> knob is turned like that and the door opens <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#57:1:A> And that's how you lock it <}> <-> kay </-> <+> okay </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#58:1:A> So you've opened it <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#59:1:A> This is the inside of the camera <,> like that <,> <}> <-> kay </->

<+> okay </+> </}> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#60:1:A> <}> <-> Kay </-> <+> Okay </+> </}> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#61:1:A> Here <,> is your pressure plate <,> and your door <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#62:1:A> And <,,> the pin <,> registration pin <,> sits right there <,> on

this little hook
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#63:1:A> To turn that <,> there's a knob <O> loud noise, something sliding

across the floor </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#64:1:A> To turn it there is this knob <}> <-> kay </-> <+> okay </+> </}>

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#65:1:A> You push that down <,> and turn and if you watch <,> not only does

it move the film through the gate frame by frame but it <,> adjusts the

registration pin
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#66:1:A> In order to load the camera <,> you need to have that pin up <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#67:1:A> Which is just you know <,> you'd see that whether or not I told you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#68:1:A> There's no way to get the film in the gate
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#69:1:A> Yeah and the inside of the <}> <-> mag </-> <+> magazine </+> </}>

<,> looks like so <,> <}> <-> kay </-> <+> okay </+> </}> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#70:1:A> Now to load the <}> <-> mag </-> <+> magazine </+> </}> <,> it's

<}> <-> gotta </-> <+> got to </+> </}> be off the camera
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#71:1:A> To take it off
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#72:1:A> This is the only problem I have with this camera is this one design

problem
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#73:1:A> The handle is in the way of the mag
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#74:1:A> I <}> <-> <.> s </.> </-> <=> suggest </=> </}> that if you are

working on a tripod <,> and you're inside and you're not doing handheld <,>

take it off
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#75:1:A> To take this off you pull <,> forward
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#76:1:A> It pulls this up <,> unlocks the handle and slides out
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#77:1:A> That way <,> you have a greater access into <,> the <}> <-> mag

</-> <+> magazine </+> </}> <,> which is just turn this knob <,> and it pulls

<,> a metal sheet out that locks it <,> the <}> <-> mag </-> <+> magazine

</+> </}> and there you go
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#78:1:A> So the <unclear> word </unclear> <}> <-> mag </-> <+> magazine </+>

</}> <,> is <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#79:1:A> The easiest way to describe it for people to remember and it's the

same as that <}> <-> mag </-> <+> magazine </+> </}> for the Arri S <,> is

you do a nine <,> in and then a mirror image of a nine out
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#80:1:A> That's what the film looks like
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#81:1:A> And <}> <-> what </-> <=> you'll </=> </}> see what I mean but

that's how you remember it <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#82:1:A> So <,> it goes in <,> through <,> a hole right here <,> <O> loud

noise starts </O> <?> underneath are </?> <O> loud noise ends </O> the white

<,> sprockets <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#83:1:A> <?> You turn this </?> <,,> it <}> <-> <.> tur </.> </-> <=> pulls

</=> </}> the film through
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#84:1:A> Keep it going
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#85:1:A> Right here which <,> there's another little notch <,> that notch

tells you <,>

<$ZD> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#86:1:Z> <O> asks a question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#87:1:A> It's a stop for the loop <}> <-> kay </-> <+> okay </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#88:1:A> That's your loop the length of the loop
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#89:1:A> You then return the film <,> into the mirror hole on the other side

and you move the other <,> wheel <,> <unclear> word </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#90:1:A> And you have to be precise
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#91:1:A> Otherwise you'll get more noise <,> and the film could break as

well <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#92:1:A> And <,> you might be saying why am I doing it upside down
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#93:1:A> Well in a black bag you're not <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+>

</}> see what you're doing anyhow <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#94:1:A> And this is what I mean by a mirror image of the nine <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#95:1:A> And never forget to put <,,> these arms down <,> because that's

your footage counter
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#96:1:A> And <O> clears throat </O> your camera operator and director of

photography will send you back into the black bag <,> to put them down cos

that's the only way to tell what the footage is
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#97:1:A> <O> loud scraping along floor starts </O> <unclear> three words

</unclear> camera footage <O> loud scraping along floor ends </O> counter on

the camera the footage counter here runs the one on the camera <,> <}> <->

kay </-> <+> okay </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#98:1:A> The next thing you do is <,> load it in <,> like so <}> <-> kay

</-> <+> okay </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#99:1:A> You put the back in first <,> push this down <,> and tighten the

screw <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#100:1:A> And don't hold it like that <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#101:1:A> The next step is to push this in <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#102:1:A> Really there's nothing to show
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#103:1:A> There's a loop inside the camera <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#104:1:A> <}> <-> Kay </-> <+> Okay </+> </}> my loop's too big <,>

<$ZE> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#105:1:Z> <O> asks a question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#106:1:A> Because <,> it must have slipped when I was trying to get it

in and pushed out more film
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#107:1:A> So that means I have to go back into the black bag <,,>

<$ZF> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#108:1:Z> <O> asks a question </O>

surface <,> <}> <-> kay </-> <+> okay </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#162:1:A> So that's what makes these <}> <-> mags </-> <+> magazines </+>

</}> completely uninterchangeable <,> with the B L <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#163:1:A> So you can't take three <}> <-> mags </-> <+> magazines </+> </}>

and say well one'll go on the Arri the S and one'll go on the B L <,> <}> <->

kay </-> <+> okay </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#164:1:A> So <,> with the film in <,> this is what the camera should sound

like <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#165:1:A> And one thing you have to do is get <,> to know what a <,> proper

sounding camera is and what a camera that's not running well sounds like <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#166:1:A> So <,> to start your camera on the pistol grip here is your on and

off button <,> <}> <-> kay </-> <+> okay </+> </}> <O> camera starts running

</O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#167:1:A> That is what a proper sounding camera is <,> supposed to sound

like <&> pause about ten seconds </&>

<$ZP> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#168:1:Z> <O> comments </O> <O> camera stops running </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#169:1:A> What do you mean it's not running <O> camera starts running

</O>

<$ZP> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#170:1:Z> <O> comments </O> <O> camera stops running </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#171:1:A> It's running at twenty-four frames per second <O> laughter

from audience </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#172:1:A> But it's not picking up properly <O> laughter from audience </O>

<$ZQ> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#173:1:Z> <O> comments </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#174:1:A> Yeah
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#175:1:A> I'm just slightly distracted cos the production I'm working on

just called me with a nine one one message <,> so

<$ZR> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#176:1:Z> <O> asks a question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#177:1:A> Well let me just fix this to show you that the camera is not

a complete disaster <O> laughter from audience </O> <&> pause about 10

seconds </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#178:1:A> <O> camera starts running </O> There
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#179:1:A> Cameras do jam <,> <}> <-> kay </-> <+> okay </+> </}> that's
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#180:1:A> Every camera in the world <O> camera stops running </O>

<$ZS> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#181:1:Z> <O> asks a question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#182:1:A> Why

<$ZS> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#183:1:Z> <O> asks a question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#184:1:A> A power surge

<$ZT> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#185:1:Z> <O> asks a question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#186:1:A> Yeah the sound
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#187:1:A> The sound of the camera
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#188:1:A> But I wasn't listening to it cos I was being paged
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#189:1:A> But <,> uhm the sound of the camera cos <,> it doesn't have a

fluid motion anymore
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#190:1:A> You hear it in the magazine something happened
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#191:1:A> For example this is
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#192:1:A> <}> <-> Kay </-> <+> Okay </+> </}> I'm gonna show you an example

of a jam <,> would be to have the film go in without a pick-up <,> right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#193:1:A> You heard what it sounded like clean but this is what it sounds

like <O> camera starts running </O> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#194:1:A> <}> <=> It just </=> <-> it </-> </}> becomes louder <,> there's a

scraping sound and as the film gets <,> full <O> camera stops running </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#195:1:A> But don't forget your ear's next to the camera at all times <,>

right <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#196:1:A> That's a jam sound <,,> <}> <-> kay </-> <+> okay </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#197:1:A> That

<$ZU> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#198:1:Z> <O> asks a question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#199:1:A> Yeah <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#200:1:A> Alright where you can hear <,> that sound <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#201:1:A> Inside the loop looks fine <,> but <{> <[> you have that </[>

<$ZV> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#202:1:Z> <[> <O> comments </O> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#203:1:A> But at the same time if you catch it soon enough <,> the film

isn't like this like an accordion <,> right

<$ZW> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#204:1:Z> <O> comments </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#205:1:A> So it's all fine <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#206:1:A> If you think there's a jam you go into the black bag you open it

<,>

<$ZW> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#207:1:Z> <O> comments </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#208:1:A> It's on this side <,> alright
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#209:1:A> I cut it so it's not on this side but <,> it's on this side
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#210:1:A> So all you have to do is wind it <,> cut the film off
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#211:1:A> Re-can it </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-057#212:2:A> Okay so I'll show you a couple of ways around that without

having to use <,> the extra source
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#213:2:A> Cos like I'm saying the extra source isn't ideal especially if

you're concerned about sound <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#214:2:A> Uhm <,> we'll get to that in a moment <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#215:2:A> Now <O> clears throat </O> <O> interference on tape begins </O>

<unclear> word </unclear> one in this case are <unclear> one or two words

</unclear> bars <O> interference on tape ends </O> <,> the synch signal
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#216:2:A> Uhh two and three are what we're concerned about
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#217:2:A> Four there is nothing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#218:2:A> D V one D V two refer to digital video
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#219:2:A> That's a frame grab and I'll show you how to do that <}> <-> kay

</-> <+> okay </+> </}> it's just still in one video in uh one frame <?>

through </?> the video
<ICE-CAN:S2A-057#220:2:A> D V three are colour backgrounds </I>
