<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#3:1:A> Under Trudeau yeah

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#4:1:B> Was that when he made his speech <{> <[> uh </[> <quote> the

something to do with the evolution of the state in the last twenty years that

they're kind of
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#14:1:B> The rhetoric that would have been appropriate to liberalism <,> has

now become appropriate to a kind of conservative outlet

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#15:1:A> Uh huh
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#16:1:A> Well it's the difference I think between <,> uhm <,> looking at uhm

equality of opportunity <}> <-> or </-> <=> or </=> </}> pure equality
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#17:1:A> You know uh are we satisfied just to treat everybody equal or do we

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#18:1:B> <{> <[> Uh huh </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#19:1:A> <[> In </[> </{> which case some people have to be treated <,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#20:1:B> Well <}> <-> that was the </-> <=> that was </=> </}> <}> <->

the </-> <=> I guess the </=> </}> uh discourse of liberalism <,,> uh in the

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#23:1:A> <[2> Hmm </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#24:1:B> That is uh you know everyone is uh equal under the law

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#25:1:A> Yeah yeah certain amount of <}> <-> a </-> <=> a </=> </}>

focus on individual rights <,> rather than any focus on uh experiences of <?>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#26:1:B> <[> Hmmm </[> </{>

<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#28:1:A> A lot of that is to do with the Charter

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#29:1:B> Yeah <,> yeah

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#30:1:B> Although <,> it's kind of interesting because uhm <,> in the

</-> <=> is </=> </}> uh it comes up <}> <-> in </-> <=> in </=> </}> some of

the feminist theory <}> <-> that </-> <=> that </=> </}> I end up reading

disappear

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#33:1:A> Hmmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#34:1:B> Because what creates distinction in the first place and what

creates the need for preferential treatment is a history of <,> disadvantage

or domination
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#35:1:B> And then <}> <-> in </-> <=> that </=> </}> <}> <-> is </-> <=> is

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#40:1:A> Uh huh

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#41:1:B> And that's why there's no Canadian identity as such because we

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#42:1:A> Right but <}> <-> then </-> <=> then </=> </}> you get to the

priest thing
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#78:1:B> It takes place in where

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#84:1:B> Catholic priest
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#85:1:B> Hmm <,,> and so <}> <-> he's </-> <=> his </=> </}> dilemma I had

the impression from some of the promos and stuff that <}> <-> it was </-> <=>

</-> <=> he was told something in confession <{> <[> and had </[> </=> </}>

to

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#86:1:A> <[> Yeah </[> </{> <}> <-> there's two </-> <=> there's two

<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#87:1:A> One is his homosexuality the other is incest <{> <[> <,> </[> which

is disclosed to him uh in the confessional booth

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#88:1:B> <[> Hmmm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#89:1:A> And his personal <,> crisis is whether to uphold the

traditions and the rules of the Church <}> <-> and not </-> <=> and not </=>

</}> uhm <}> <-> not disclose not </-> <=> not uhm reveal </=> </}> what was

disclosed to him or to stop the suffering of this girl who <}> <-> wouldn't

<-> her </-> <=> her </=> </}> mother

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#90:1:B> Wait who confessed the girl

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#91:1:A> The girl confessed but she didn't want him to tell anyone <,>

and do anything about it and so uh

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#92:1:B> Why did she confess
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#93:1:B> <}> <-> I mean she uh </-> <=> usually you confess sins </=> </}>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#94:1:A> Yeah I know but I mean she had to talk to someone she just it

was <}> <-> after she </-> <=> after she'd </=> </}> finished confessing <}>

<-> and then </-> <=> and uhm </=> </}> she just hadn't told anyone in her

life so
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#95:1:A> So I mean he is struggling with his dilemma which was uh basically

the whole idea whether <}> <-> the Church should be uh </-> <,> <=> we should

recognize </=> </}> uhm <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> problems in

institutional constraint and be flexible enough to allow for uh changes in

the rules <}> <-> when </-> <=> when </=> </}> we need or whether tradition

and authority should always uh win over
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#96:1:A> And that's the same thing with him
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#97:1:A> I mean should he uh be allowed to experiment with his sexuality in

order to be a better priest in order to know himself better or uhm does he

have to totally repress everything <{> <[> so </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#98:1:B> <[> Hmmm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#99:1:A> <}> <-> And at the end he </-> <=> And at the end </=> </}>

<}> <-> he </-> <=> he's </=> </}> charged with uh conducting in an act and

uh he's like ostracized from the whole parish and everyone you know what I

mean
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#100:1:A> And <}> <-> it's this really wonderful </-> <=> uh his fellow </=>

</}> colleague priest is really great
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#101:1:A> <}> <-> And he comes he </-> <=> he </=> </}> encourages uhm <}>

<-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> priest the first priest to come back and do

mass together with him and uhm <,> in that way he'd be showing that his sin

is no greater than <}> <-> the </-> <=> uh the </=> </}> sins of the average

person
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#102:1:A> Uhm and so he does that but everyone <}> <-> in the congregation

</-> <=> in the parish </=> </}> uh totally ostracizes him except for that

one young girl <}> <-> who ah </-> <=> who </=> </}> wrote to him her incest
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#103:1:A> <}> <-> So </-> <=> So </=> </}> <}> <-> that's showing you </->

<=> that's just showing </=> </}> that they each are supporting each other
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#104:1:A> Anyway uh he's very emotional <{> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#105:1:B> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#106:1:A> Like and afterwards he was very mad at himself for <}> <->

not </-> <=> not </=> </}> stopping her suffering
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#107:1:A> And he apologized to her <,> cos he knew <}> <-> he was </-> <=>

he should </=> </}> have stopped the suffering but <,> he didn't and so I

think that turned out with that
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#108:1:A> She was the first one to forgive him for his sins which made <}>

<-> it her </-> <=> her </=> </}> forgiveness all the more Christian and all

the more uhm <,> uh laudable

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#109:1:B> Right but did she blame him <{> <[> for not </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#110:1:A> <[> No </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#111:1:A> But the mother did and maybe she did herself

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#112:1:B> You mean blame him for not <{> <[> telling </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#113:1:A> <[> Yep </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#114:1:B> And her mother did

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#115:1:A> Her mother did
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#116:1:A> Her mother blamed it on the priest at the end
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#117:1:A> This is your fault that we didn't know
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#118:1:A> If you had told us we would have stopped this and I hope you rot

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#122:1:A> Ya
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#123:1:A> But it was an interesting study by incest uhm victims and

in a sense a Jesuit but an initiate
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#155:1:A> And uhm so there's sort of an anecdotal story about <}> <-> the

this </-> <=> A kind of a prof </=> </}> or whatever who told his students

you know uh like sometime before the ordination was due to take place the

students had you know been fairly successful in their courses

you know buy a hooker in the <}> <-> streets </-> <=> back streets </=> </}>

of Rome so that they would know something about <,> human sexuality if they

didn't already because it would help in their uhm <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-025#157:1:A> And they should deal with that part of their character whatever

kind of <,> you know sexuality they had because it would make them a better

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#168:1:A> Well yeah I think so ya

modern Europe you get the impression that priests were always uh you know

</unclear> council uhm uhm there seems to have been this concern that priests

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#172:1:B> Uh huh

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#173:1:A> So the fact that they were prohibiting this stuff suggests

that <,> they thought it was occurring

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#174:1:B> Uh huh

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-025#175:1:A> It's kind of difficult to say <{> <[> <,> </[> I guess how
