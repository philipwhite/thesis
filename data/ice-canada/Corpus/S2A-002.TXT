<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#1:1:A> A two-man advantage for Calgary and Johnson got credit for the

goal <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#2:1:A> Simpson to face off <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#3:1:A> Simpson ready to face off against Johnson

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#4:1:B> There's some kind of uh material at centre ice or <,> something
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#5:1:B> <{> <[> <unclear> a few words </unclear> </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#6:1:A> <[> A couple Dinosaurs </[> </{> are hollering for the linesman

to go get it <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#7:1:A> Just some broken ice

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#8:1:B> <O> laugh </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#9:1:A> Just a bunch of broken ice <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#10:1:A> <?> Well </?> a bit of a snow pack <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#11:1:A> Here's <?> Haven </?> off the draw
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#12:1:A> Todd <}> <-> <.> Johns </.> </-> <+> Johnson </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#13:1:A> Thompson the shot <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#14:1:A> And the save by Dawkins
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#15:1:A> A nice <,> draw win <,,> by Simpson and Thompson in the slot didn't

get a whole lot of wood on it <,> and Dawkins down quickly
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#16:1:A> He goes down a lot

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#17:1:B> And there's a lot of rebounds tonight
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#18:1:B> The Bears have got to get
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#19:1:B> After that initial shot somebody's got to get to that net cos

there's some uh uh open net goals sitting there for <}> <-> em </-> <+> them

</+> </}> <,,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#20:1:A> Calgary has some decent-sized defencemen <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#21:1:A> Ruark six three <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#22:1:A> He's one of their bigger boys
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#23:1:A> Dinosaurs lose it off the draw
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#24:1:A> Here's Simpson in the slot
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#25:1:A> Poking into the corner
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#26:1:A> Thompson <,> feeds it off to Colin Zarowny <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#27:1:A> They battle in there and Schonek comes up with it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#28:1:A> Schonek will take it behind the net <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#29:1:A> Marlborough tying up <,,> Simpson who was trying to <,> forecheck

for it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#30:1:A> Flint gets to the line
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#31:1:A> His shot <,> sails wide of the net <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#32:1:A> And Thompson there to knife it ahead
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#33:1:A> Colin Zarowny
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#34:1:A> Last minute in the period
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#35:1:A> Ahead to Simpson
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#36:1:A> Simpson will dump it in
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#37:1:A> Goes deep to the corner
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#38:1:A> After it there is Colin Zarowny
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#39:1:A> Drops it off for Simpson
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#40:1:A> Now Thompson left circle <,> with the shot
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#41:1:A> That one off a skate wide of the net <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#42:1:A> <w> Dinosaurs' </w> Couldwell being checked
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#43:1:A> Bears trying to come up with it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#44:1:A> Two guys went after it and the puck had come free <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#45:1:A> And the Dinosaurs are able to clear <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#46:1:A> Goodkey now
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#47:1:A> He lost it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#48:1:A> Here's a chance for Krywulak
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#49:1:A> It's poked away by Masson <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#50:1:A> Johnson <,> trying to work it up the boards
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#51:1:A> Drops it off for Krywulak
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#52:1:A> There's a man open in front <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#53:1:A> Pass doesn't get through
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#54:1:A> Back to the point now
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#55:1:A> Masters right side for Marlborough
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#56:1:A> Out front for Johnson
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#57:1:A> Johnson shot
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#58:1:A> He hammered one over top the net
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#59:1:A> Off the glass it went up the boards
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#60:1:A> Bears in trouble in their own end as Krywulak comes in with high

hit on Jickling <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#61:1:A> Bears flip it high in the air and out to centre ice
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#62:1:A> Ten seconds to go in the period
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#63:1:A> Ziliniak will send it back in
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#64:1:A> Pullishy back to play it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#65:1:A> Five seconds to go
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#66:1:A> That should do it for the period as Pullishy dumps it up the open

wing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#67:1:A> And the buzzer sounds to end period number one
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#68:1:A> Bears in big trouble in that last minute of play in their own end

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#69:1:B> And the difference between this weekend and last weekend we

could just see in that last shift uh <,> Couldwell made a bad play going back

in his own end
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#70:1:B> Simpson took it out
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#71:1:B> The puck's <}> <-> <w> sittin </w> </-> <+> sitting </+> </}> there

for Colin Zarowny
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#72:1:B> Instead of taking it and looking for the man like he would have

done last week <,> he decided to hit Couldwell again and the Dinos got the

puck
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#73:1:B> And uh uh they're just not playing it as smart as they did <{> <[>

last weekend </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#74:1:A> <[> Kevin Schmalz </[> </{> <,,> who didn't see one second of

ice time in that period went out and dumped <,> the <w> Bears' </w> <,> uh

Jickling I believe it was after <,> the players are milling <{> <[> about

</[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#75:1:B> <[> <unclear> word </unclear> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#76:1:A> So he's out there to stretch his legs and he <,> <O> laugh

</O> is out there doing it to one of the <w> Bears' </w> top players <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#77:1:A> I guess a smart move from Calgary's standpoint but uh <,,> I mean

if they're going to mess with you why don't they send one of their gunners

out there to mess with one of your gunners <,,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#78:1:B> Ya <{> <[> I don't know <@> Ev </@> </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#79:1:A> <[> It's chess game </[> </{> here

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#80:1:B> Who knows

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#81:1:A> Who knows the reasons these things happen <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#82:1:A> The goal scoring in that period Todd Johnson on the powerplay at

four thirteen
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#83:1:A> Couldwell and Krywulak with assists
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#84:1:A> It was a <,> two-man advantage a five-on-three powerplay <,> and

that was the only goal of the period
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#85:1:A> The shots on goal in that period we'll get for you in just a moment

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#86:1:A> The shots <,> for Calgary nine <,> and for Alberta six
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#87:1:A> So we thank the people here for that information <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#88:1:A> So for Calgary nine
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#89:1:A> Alberta six <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#90:1:A> One nothing the score
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#91:1:A> <@> Jeff </@> <,> two powerplays <,> for both teams <,> and the

difference I think <,> was clearly that five-on-three advantage that Calgary

got
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#92:1:A> Bears <}> <-> woulda </-> <+> would have </+> </}> had one too if

Terry Degner <}> <-> hadn'ta </-> <+> hadn't have </+> </}> taken that

penalty

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#93:1:B> Ya I mean <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> ref did even

things up there <}> <-> and <.> w </.> </-> <=> and the </=> </}> Bears would

have had a minute oh two with the five-on-three <,> which is <}> <-> a </->

<=> a </=> </}> great opportunity and uh <,> Deigs is probably a little bit

upset at himself right now

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#94:1:A> Let's take a time-out come back and hear from Mike Thompson in

our first intermission
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#95:1:A> It's the Calgary Dinosaurs one the Alberta Golden Bears no score in

Canada West University Playoff hockey action
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#96:1:A> Game two of this best of three division final <,> from the Clare

Drake Arena in Calgary on Sports Radio C J S R F M eighty-eight <O>

commercials, interviews, and analysis in the intermission, 13 min 20 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#97:1:A> And so the second period moments away here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#98:1:A> Masson leads the Bears out
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#99:1:A> Dawkins <,,> leads Calgary out <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#100:1:A> And really if you recap that first like we've tried to do here

Dawkins was not forced to make a lot of saves
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#101:1:A> Only six and <,> maybe one real <,> nice one <,> and that was off

Mike Thompson <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#102:1:A> And uh Thompson didn't get great wood on it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#103:1:A> But it was right off a faceoff win by Ken Simpson and Thompson <,>

corralled the puck and <,> flipped it toward the net
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#104:1:A> Didn't get all the wood on it he would have liked but uh <,>

Dawkins stopped it anyway

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#105:1:B> <}> <-> And he </-> <=> and he </=> </}> gave up some juicy

rebounds though
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#106:1:B> He hasn't looked that sharp in stopping uh even the easiest shots
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#107:1:B> <}> <-> And </-> <=> and </=> </}> the Bears <}> <-> gotta </->

<+> have got to </+> </}> <,> uh hope they get some better chances on him and

get guys going to the net for rebound <,,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#108:1:A> Two teams will be even-strength off the start of the second
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#109:1:A> The Bears send <,,> the law firm out there Zarowny Zarowny and

Simpson <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#110:1:A> And Calgary <,,> counters <,,> with Johnson Couldwell and Krywulak

their top line <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#111:1:A> And the Dinosaurs have the puck off the faceoff
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#112:1:A> Ruark working from his own end
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#113:1:A> Up the right-wing boards he goes
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#114:1:A> Hammers it in across the line
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#115:1:A> Round and round it goes
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#116:1:A> Up the left wing now for Johnson <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#117:1:A> Sends it to the corner to Couldwell
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#118:1:A> Back to Johnson
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#119:1:A> He fell on the play <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#120:1:A> The Bears are able to clear
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#121:1:A> Here's Simpson down the wing <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#122:1:A> Simpson on the right side
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#123:1:A> Flipped it off the linesman
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#124:1:A> Chops it into the corner now
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#125:1:A> Was hit by Masters
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#126:1:A> Colin Zarowny looking for it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#127:1:A> Racing in from the point is Hjertaas <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#128:1:A> Puts it in behind the net to the left corner for Simpson
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#129:1:A> Simpson <,,> will chip it deep <,> into the zone <,,> for Colin

Zarowny
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#130:1:A> He had it batted away and Krywulak shovels it out to centre ice

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#131:1:A> Bears send it right back in
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#132:1:A> Here's Simpson <,> just inside the blue line
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#133:1:A> Flips one toward the net
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#134:1:A> Saved by Dawkins
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#135:1:A> And then Aaron Zarowny smashes his man <,> as Ruark tried to clear
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#136:1:A> Here they come though the Dinosaurs
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#137:1:A> This is Johnson to centre <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#138:1:A> Johnson with the puck moves in
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#139:1:A> Lets a shot go
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#140:1:A> And boy did he hammer that thing wide
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#141:1:A> They score off the rebound <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#142:1:A> It went off the glass and Johnson raced over and <,> slammed it in

to the open net as Masson came diving across <,> in a desperate bid to <,,>

stop that thing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#143:1:A> He let a rocket go and everybody watched it

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#144:1:B> Exactly <@> Evan </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#145:1:B> Everybody watched it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#146:1:B> The reaction time there is not what it has to be <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#147:1:B> Two defencemen were back and Masson could have reacted faster
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#148:1:B> He didn't react till he saw Johnson uh <,,> lining up the rebound
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#149:1:B> And the two defencemen just stood and watched the rebound come out
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#150:1:B> And uh <,> Johnson's got a wicked shot for a small guy
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#151:1:B> But uh there's no way in the world he <,> should have had a

rebound that juicy

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#152:1:A> Johnson his second of the playoffs <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#153:1:A> Second of the night <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#154:1:A> It comes at the fifty-four second mark here of the second period
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#155:1:A> There's Haney for it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#156:1:A> Now ahead to Esposito
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#157:1:A> Drops it back for Pullishy <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#158:1:A> Pullishy working from his own zone
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#159:1:A> Skates to centre
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#160:1:A> Flips it deep into the corner <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#161:1:A> Esposito gets to it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#162:1:A> He lets a shot go
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#163:1:A> Comes back to the left point <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#164:1:A> Here is Pullishy
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#165:1:A> A long shot missed the net <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#166:1:A> And that's an unassisted goal <,,> for Johnson
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#167:1:A> Bears have it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#168:1:A> Here's Strand
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#169:1:A> Across the line for Haney
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#170:1:A> Haney moves in
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#171:1:A> Shoots
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#172:1:A> Saved <,> by Dawkins
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#173:1:A> Nice stop
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#174:1:A> His best of the night
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#175:1:A> As Haney got all that one and Dawkins well out to challenge <,>

made it a fine glove save

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#176:1:B> Dawkins had to come up with a good save for once and he did
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#177:1:B> Uh really nice
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#178:1:B> Nice pass touch pass backhand by Paul Strand
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#179:1:B> And uh <,> good wood by Haney
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#180:1:B> He put his head down and <,> ripped it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#181:1:B> And Dawkins when he saw Haney put his head down he came out and uh

was able to make the save
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#182:1:B> A nice glove save by Dawkins <,,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#183:1:A> Draw will be to the stick-hand side of the Calgary goaltender

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#184:1:A> Last night the Bears <,> went up two nothing and lost the game
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#185:1:A> Tonight the Dinosaurs are up by a pair <,,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#186:1:B> Bears are <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> have <{>

<[> to <,,> </[> face adversity tonight and come back

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#187:1:A> <[> So anything can happen </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#188:1:B> Uh not only the <,,> series could be over they're down two

nothing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#189:1:B> It's going to be tough <,,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#190:1:A> Jickling on the faceoff <,,> against Calgary's Townsend
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#191:1:A> And Townsend won that one
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#192:1:A> Goes back into the corner for Steveson
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#193:1:A> Left corner for Zulyniak and he plays it up the wing for Marble
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#194:1:A> Marble chipping it out to centre for Stephenson
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#195:1:A> Stephenson can't get around Jickling <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#196:1:A> Puck deep in the <w> Bears' </w> <,> zone <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#197:1:A> <?> Still </?> <,> it's cleared out to centre
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#198:1:A> Just out of the reach of Thompson
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#199:1:A> Two nothing Calgary in front here early in the second
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#200:1:A> Long lead pass for Schmalz
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#201:1:A> He's in on <,,> the Bear defender Christiansen who took him out

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#202:1:A> Christiansen plays it ahead and away goes Thompson
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#203:1:A> He's across the line
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#204:1:A> Thompson takes a look
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#205:1:A> Thompson <,> feeding it out front <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#206:1:A> Nobody there for Alberta <,,> and the Dinosaurs'll just <,> send

it down the ice
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#207:1:A> That went off the linesman <,> otherwise it might have been icing

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#208:1:A> Adair <,> now up the wall ahead for Degner and he steers it in

across the the Calgary line
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#209:1:A> Dawkins stops it for Marble <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#210:1:A> Marble a long breakaway pass for the Bear line but that's picked

off by Hjertaas
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#211:1:A> Hjertaas will step across the line
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#212:1:A> In for Colin Zarowny
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#213:1:A> Zarowny lets a shot go
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#214:1:A> And that's <,> deflected to the corner by Townsend
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#215:1:A> Now a cross-ice feed to the right point
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#216:1:A> Snapshot by Simpson
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#217:1:A> He broke his stick on it or it was blocked in part by Townsend who

lost his stick on it <,> and it dribbles in to goaltender Dawkins

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#218:1:B> That's the best the Bears have looked all night <,> since

that second goal by the Dinos
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#219:1:B> Two good shifts in a row
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#220:1:B> First by Jickling's line and now Zarowny's line
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#221:1:B> The law firm came out and they're playing well <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#222:1:B> They <}> <-> gotta </-> <+> have got to </+> </}> keep the green

wave going on the Dinos and uh get some flow and get some momentum going

their way
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#223:1:B> Draw will be to the glove-hand side of Dawkins <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#224:1:B> Aaron Zarowny to face off against Thompson
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#225:1:B> And Aaron Zarowny waved <}> <-> outta </-> <+> out of </+> </}>

there <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#226:1:B> Colin Zarowny now to take the draw <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#227:1:B> Bears have it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#228:1:B> Here's Hjertaas with a shot
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#229:1:B> Pad save Dawkins <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#230:1:B> He had problems with it but he covers it up <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#231:1:B> Another thing here too <@> Jeff </@> on these faceoffs is <,> that

if you're the home team <,> it makes a difference as to who puts their stick

down first
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#232:1:B> Isn't it supposed to at least

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2A-002#233:1:B> Uh or it's the defensive zone
<ICE-CAN:S2A-002#234:1:B> And uh like <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> believe the defensive

zone centre has to put their uh stick down first </I>
