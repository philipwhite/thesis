<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#1:1> <h> Extradition hearing delayed for drug suspects </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#2:1> Three men suspected of heading the Canadian connection in an

international drug-smuggling ring were granted a postponement in an

extradition hearing yesterday. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#3:1> Michel Chouinard, 46, Pierre Doyer, 43, and Jean Bouthillier, 59,

are wanted by the U.S. drug enforcement authorities.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#4:1> It is alleged they imported tonnes of marijuana to Florida's Gulf

Coast. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#5:1> Doyer and Chouinard, who operated Domaine Montjoye ski centre near

North Hatley, are suspected of being key figures in a ring that used Canadian

institutions to launder U.S. drug money. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#6:1> Yesterday, the three were to appear before Quebec Superior Justice

Claire Barrette-Joncas on a U.S. request for extradition. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#7:1> Defence lawyers Jacques Blanchette and Lawrence Corriveau obtained

a delay until June 18 while they await details of the allegations.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#8:1> Since the three were arrested May 31, police have been searching for

documents in financial institutions, and impounded property worth &dollar;6

million, including the ski hill. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#9:2> <h> Municipalities support Montreal's demand for combat-weapons ban

</h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#10:2> QUEBEC - Canadian municipal leaders have endorsed Montreal's

attempt to rid the country of the type of weapon Marc Lepine used in the Dec.

6 massacre at the Universite de Montreal's Ecole Polytechnique. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#11:2> Delegates at the annual meeting of the Federation of Canadian

Municipalities yesterday approved a motion calling on the federal government

to forbid the sale, possession and use of combat weapons. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#12:2> Steered through the meeting by Montreal Mayor Jean Dore, the

resolution was endorsed unanimously.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#13:2> There are 1,200 delegates. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#14:2> " What we want to ban are combat weapons or what are otherwise

described as assault weapons that are sold over the counter," Dore told

delegates. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#15:2> The motion follows a similar one endorsed by Montreal council

following the massacre of 14 women at the school.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#16:2> Polytechnique students started a campaign to ban the weapons after

the shooting. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#17:2> It asks the federal government to <quote> " take immediate action

to forbid the sale, possession and use of military and paramilitary combat

weapons in Canada with the exception of members of the Canadian Forces and

law enforcement officers in the fulfilment of their duties." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#18:2> Dore said the rapid-fire rifles with large-capacity bullet clips

are dangerous to have around, even in the hands of collectors. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#19:2> The rifle Lepine used was a .226-calibre semiautomatic Sturm

Ruger with a 30-round clip. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#20:2> In May, federal Justice Minister Kim Campbell told the Commons

she will introduce legislation to amend the existing firearms law.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#21:2> The announcement followed the presentation of a petition from

students bearing 516,487 names. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#22:2> She said she won't ban semiautomatic rifles but will ban the

import of military rifles that can easily be converted to rapid-fire. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#23:2> Would-be gun-buyers would also have to find a " guarantor" and

provide more information to get a firearms acquisitions certificate. </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#24:3> <h> Leaders on verge of breakthrough; Talks resume today amid

optimism; </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#25:3> <h> THE CONSTITUTIONAL DEBATE </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#26:3> OTTAWA - The first ministers appeared on the verge last night of

breaking the constitutional impasse over the Meech Lake accord. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#27:3> But the deal is still fragile and far from final. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#28:3> The tentative deal would include a commission to make

recommendations on the creation of a Triple-E Senate.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#29:3> The deal also would call for a new preamble to the constitution with

a comprehensive definition of the fundamental characteristics of Canadian

society - the so-called Canada clause. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#30:3> The contentious issue of the distinct-society status accorded

Quebec by Meech Lake has yet to tackled in detail, senior federal officials

said last night. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#31:3> The 11 leaders will meet again this morning for a fourth day of

closed-door bargaining. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#32:3> After 13 hours of private negotiations yesterday, they filed out

shortly before 10 p.m., most with smiles rather than the grim looks they've

shown for three days. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#33:3> " We are a long way from any final arrangements but we have made

some progress," Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#34:3> " It was a pretty good day's work." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#35:3> Mulroney said the session could stretch all day today and perhaps

into tomorrow before the first ministers bring their bargaining into the

open. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#36:3> " We have a long way to go," he said.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#37:3> " We are not there, not by a long shot." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#38:3> " I am pleased with the progress we made...
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#39:3> I feel we are getting somewhere," said Manitoba's Gary Filmon, one of

two premiers who have still refused to approve the accord.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#40:3> " We made progress on all areas and that is a major improvement."

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#41:3> Filmon and Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells want a commitment to

Senate reform among other demands before they'll sign the accord by the June

23 deadline. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#42:3> Wells said last night " significant progress" was made.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#43:3> " The tone of the discussion all day was very, very good," he said.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#44:3> However, Wells added: " Progress has been made but we are not

there yet." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#45:3> Wells said a deal would depend on reaching a <quote> " complete

package - that package is not there yet." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#46:3> Canadian Press said the plan for Senate reform, pushed by P.E.I.

Premier Joe Ghiz, was apparently the brainchild of former Liberal cabinet

minister Jack Pickersgill, who will turn 85 on June 23.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#47:3> That's the same day the accord expires if not ratified by holdout

provinces New Brunswick, Manitoba and Newfoundland. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#48:3> According to the plan, Should no agreement arise from the

commission leading to a Triple-E Senate - equal, elected and effective - the

four western provinces and Newfoundland would each have their representation

increased to 10 senators from 6. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#49:3> Ontario and Quebec - 24 each - and Nova Scotia and New Brunswick

- 10 each - would keep their present number of senators and Prince Edward

Island would get one more, making five. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#50:3> But Filmon and Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa said there were

many options discussed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#51:3> Ghiz said it was <quote> " premature" </quote> to say what the

final solution for Senate reform will look like. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#52:3> Bourassa said the first ministers <quote> " made a step forward"

</quote> to bringing the accord into law by the June 23 deadline.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#53:3> " I am more confident," he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#54:3> " There was an air of optimism," Nova Scotia Premier John

Buchanan said as the private session ended last night. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#55:3> Alberta Premier Don Getty said confirmed that the first ministers

are looking at a commission, with federal and provincial representatives, to

study Senate reform.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#56:3> " We are going to have a reformed Senate," he said confidently. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#57:3> Earlier, in the late afternoon, Mulroney said progress was

contingent on the settlement of other sticky issues yet to be tackled in

detail. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#58:3> Mulroney didn't specify the issue on which progress was made.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#59:3> Mulroney pointedly tried to counter the complaints of the two

holdout premiers that their criticisms surrounding the Meech Lake accord are

being ignored. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#60:3> Mulroney said all the issues can't be dealt with at the same

time.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#61:3> " All the premiers who have concerns will have those concerns dealt

with," he said, then added: " Perhaps not to their entire satisfaction, or

perhaps not to their satisfaction at all." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#62:3> New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna said on Monday his complaints

have been largely satisfied by federal proposals. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#63:3> " Premier McKenna came onside, which is a very important

development," Mulroney said as yesterday's session began. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#64:4> <h> Anti-pollution bill faces tough battle: Paradis </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#65:4> QUEBEC - Doubters in the cabinet and stiff opposition from

industry could quash the government's bid to adopt a tough polluter-pay law,

Environment Minister Pierre Paradis said yesterday. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#66:4> Paradis said he expects representatives of the mining, petroleum

and chemical industries to come out swinging when they appear before a

legislature committee examining Bill 65. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#67:4> The committee hearings began yesterday. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#68:4> Paradis wouldn't reveal which cabinet members oppose the

legislation, but did say its foes are concerned the law might not stand up in

the courts. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#69:4> Bill 65 would amend the province's Environment Quality Act,

allowing the government to force polluting companies to clean up their

contaminated sites.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#70:4> If they refuse, the government could do it and send them the bill.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#71:4> Penalties would include fines as high as &dollar;1 million, and

the government could seize a floundering company's assets as a preferred

creditor. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#72:4> The cabinet has taken the unusual step of asking to study the

legislation one last time before it is sent to the National Assembly for a

vote.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#73:4> That would give the bill's opponents more time to lobby for changes.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#74:4> " You're not going to have legislation that is ahead of most

other jurisdictions without having that kind of fight," he said.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#75:4> " But that's part of the job of the minister of the environment."

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#76:4> Paradis says he's counting on public support to push the law

through by the end of the current session. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#77:4> In tabling the bill in May, Paradis admitted he was venturing

into delicate legal areas involving property rights, the civil code and the

charters protecting the rights of persons. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#78:4> Environmental lawyers have told The Gazette the law would not

withstand legal challenges, because Quebec's civil code clearly specifies

property rights. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#79:4> Opponents of the bill outnumbered supporters yesterday at the

committee hearings. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#80:4> Pierre Gosselin, an official with Quebec's community health

department network, told the committee the bill's mechanics need work.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#81:4> " More businessmen will go under or flee to Florida and eventually

the minister ... will find businessmen unable to pay," he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#82:4> The <indig> Conseil du Patronat </indig> , the province's largest

<w> employers' </w> group, said the bill's coercive measures leave little

room for companies to collaborate with the government in cleanups. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#83:4> It said the costs associated with the bill are enormous, the

fines too severe and the rules too vague. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#84:4> Noting that corporations aren't the only ones responsible for

pollution, it said the law would have <quote> " serious consequences on the

financial health of enterprises and municipalities." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#85:4> Montreal would face special problems under the law, city

executive committee chairman Michael Fainstat said in an interview yesterday.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#86:4> Many Montreal firms inherited polluted sites and had nothing to

do with contaminating them, said Fainstat, who will appear at the hearings

tomorrow. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#87:4> He said the law might scare away plant owners, leaving the city

stuck with tainted sites. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#88:5> <h> Economic influence called crucial; </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#89:5> <h> WOMEN AND POWER </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#90:5> Economic influence lies at the centre of power, a Canadian

banking official told about 1,000 delegates at a conference on women and

power at the Palais de Congres yesterday. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#91:5> " All the gains women have realized are a direct reflection of

economic power," said Joanne De Laurentiis, vice-president of the Canadian

Bankers Association. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#92:5> " Without some economic independence, a person's ability to

achieve is severely limited." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#93:5> De Laurentiis was speaking at a conference forum on power and the

economy.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#94:5> The conference, the first international summit on women and power,

runs through Friday. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#95:5> Her remarks came on the same day as a former prostitute

encouraged summit participants to move away from <quote> " careerist"

</quote> attitudes and address the day-to-day concerns of poor working women.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#96:5> Laurentiis pointed out that women in the 19th century generally

had no property, capital or income, and were viewed as poor credit risks by

banks. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#97:5> " This attitude persisted even after women began to enter the

marketplace in droves, and it played a part in delaying the economic growth

of women," she said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#98:5> " Without access to credit, women could not leverage their income

to expand businesses or make investment." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#99:5> But she said the past 10 years have seen an enormous change, and

noted that in the 1980s women started as many new businesses as men did. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#100:5> Women now own 23 per cent of the 900,000 businesses in Canada,

De Laurentiis said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#101:5> " Women are starting to drive the economy." </p>

<P> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#102:5> The United States has more than 3 million woman entrepreneurs,

said Marie Letourneau-Galanti, president of a French-language newspaper based

in California. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#103:5> The U.S. is an easy place to start a new business, but a

difficult spot to reconcile the needs of family and work, she remarked </p> .

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#104:5> " Our president, George Bush, recently rejected a proposed law

that would give women unpaid maternity leave because such a provision would

run counter to business interests," she said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#105:5> Men and women differ enormously in what they want when they go

into business for themselves, Letourneau-Galanti said.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-006#106:5> Men seeking wealth, while women want to create their own jobs and

earn a living. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#107:5> " I would like us to be more confident and aggressive and in

charge," she said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-006#108:5> Letourneau-Galanti said the chance to create a new business is a

tool women can use any time they want to overcome the unequal distribution of

wealth between men and women. </p> </I>
