<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#1:1> This quote comes from Virginia Woolf's <ul> A Room of One's Own

</ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#2:1> It is a significant quote in that she gives the art of storytelling

more credibility <unclear> unclear word or punctuation </unclear> meaning

that fact itself.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#3:1> What she proposes is that the 'little' stories about women will be the

one's that carry the most meaningful and hence be more <}> <-> inciteful </->

<+> insightful </+> </}> to their condition. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#4:1> This quote is from Wordsworth in his <ul> Preface to <}> <->

Lyrrical </-> <+> Lyrical </+> </}> Ballads </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#5:1> It is a significant quote in that it describes his method of creating

poetry.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#6:1> He was a strong believer in the process of delaying one's thought

until a later time.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#7:1> <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> He claimed that after

<ul> quality thinking </ul> on something ( an <.> eve </.> idea) <del>

<unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> one day you will <ul> just be hit

</ul> with how to write it down, hence the spontaneity. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#8:1> This is from William Shakespeare, and is found within his play The

Tempest.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#9:1> It is significant on that they are discussing the change of human

character.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#10:1> <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> A person who dies at

sea, experiences this sea change and their whole character changes.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#11:1> For example their eyes, bones become coral. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#12:1> This is a quote by John Donne in his famous poem <ul> The Flea

</ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#13:1> It is significant in that the male narrator in the poem is using the

flea <del> as </del> ( which just bit each of them) as a mean's of persuading

his new wife to have sex with him.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#14:1> He claims that it would be a small progression to do so, since their

blood has already been mixed within this flea. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#15:1> This is a quote from Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#16:1> It is an important one in that it is Clarissa, another woman who does

the 'dirty deed' of cutting Belinda's hair.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#17:1> She has been compelled to do so by <del> <unclear> unclear word

</unclear> </del> jealousy, as she perceives Belinda as the 'spoiled brat'

and deserving.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#18:1> The 2-edged weapon is obviously the scissors. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#19:1> This is a quote from Kate Stern <del> <.> fr <.> </del> in her

novel Thinking About Magritte.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#20:1> It is a quote of importance in that within her work, the <?>

characters </?> all seem to be wanting a change in their life.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#21:1> <?> One </?> character in her novel ( Cowboy?) was in the water and

claimed <quote> things are not so heavy here </quote> ( that we wanted to

stay).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#22:1> Like this quote the characters perceive this life as full <?> </?> of

</?> misery and anything else would be a progression. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#23:1> This comes from Christine Rossetti's <ul> The Goblin Men </ul>

and is very important for a critical understanding of the <?> world </?> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#24:1> When Lizzie brings her sister the fruit ( on her fare) from the

Goblin Men, she saves her sister's life.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#25:1> It can be understood as a promotion of siblings getting along or more

deeply as <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> the notion that men

cannot help you, but another woman can. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#26:1> I believe this quote comes from the movie we watched " The

Forbidden Planet".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#27:1> It was important in that it gave an explanation to the origins of the

Beast; that it came from within us.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#28:1> And to fight the Beast one must confront their inner <}> <->

conciousness </-> <+> consciousness </+> </}> as the Dr. did within this

movie.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#29:1> It was also strongly related to <?> Shakespeare's </?> The Tempest.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#30:1> This is a quote by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu in her work " The

Lover".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#31:1> It is significant in that she is telling a man that she is interested

in sex, but that she does not want to become pregnant.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#32:1> In doing so she would face childbirth ( death perhaps), and the

raising of the children.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#33:1> She knows how short life can be and simply sees this pleasure as not

being worth the threat of her life, desires. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#34:1> I <ul> think </ul> that this is from T.S. Eliot's " The

Wasteland".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#35:1> It would be significant to the text in that he sees society as being

somehow depressed, but capable of coming out of it should they choose to do

so.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#36:1> Like Wordsworth, he believes the power to do so is with the poet,

hence he asks if <quote> I shall at least set my lands in order? </quote> .

</p>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#37:1> <h> Dramatic Monologue </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#38:1> <del> A </del> The use of dramatic monologue is such that in

doing so, the author achieves a significant effect in comparison to other

methods.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#39:1> It is important to note that a dramatic monologue has 3 constituent

elements to it.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#40:1> The first of these is the requirement of a NARRATOR.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#41:1> The narrator is writing within the first person and while doing so is

NOT the author of the work.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#42:1> The actions of a text that uses dramatic monologue occur <foreign> in

medias res </foreign> ( already in progress) and hence we rely on the

narrator for information in terms of plot, setting, etc.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#43:1> The second criteria is a SILENT AUDITOR, a character that remains

silent throughout but who's actions can be deduced from the narrator's words.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#44:1> The silent auditor is <del> <unclear> <.> gener </.> </unclear>

</del> the one who is being addressed throughout the work.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#45:1> Lastly, there must be an UNINTENTIONAL REVELATION, whereby the reader

gains insight into the story where the narrator would rather not have insight

known.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#46:1> Again, it is deduced by the narrator's words, and can often appear to

be a " slip of the tongue" of sorts </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#47:1> A work where all 3 of these criteria are met, is Robert

Browning's My Last Duchess.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#48:1> The <del> silent </del> narrator is the Duke who is showing a

prospective father in law around his house.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#49:1> The man he is talking to hence is the silent auditor.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#50:1> Lastly, the unintentional revelation is that the Duke <ul> killed

</ul> his last wife ( Duchess) for being too promiscuous - <quote> how shall

I say, easily made happy </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#51:1> While they are looking at the painting of her, he almost <?>

unconciously </?> is drawn back to the act, and he recollects his feelings.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#52:1> He never blatantly reveals the fact that he killed her but you know

it from his words. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#53:1> Browning may have used such a construct as <?> dramatic </?>

monologue for the reader to get a different outlook on his character.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#54:1> We learn of his intense pride for his 900 year old name, and the

extent to which he will go to preserve it.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#55:1> Lastly, it also creates a greater interest in the work. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#56:1> Writers often use their works as vehicles with which to criticize

the standards and values of the societies in which they live.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#57:1> I will argue that the above statement is <del> in </del> indeed

correct, and that it can be substantiated with reference to three different

authors.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#58:1> I will use the works of Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope and Thomas

More in doing so. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#59:1> Jonathan Swift is <del> a </del> the foremost leader of all the

authors we studied in terms of social criticism.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#60:1> This is not to say that it is only his work that takes a strong

position, but rather that it takes the strongest.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#61:1> His piece titled " A Modest Proposal" is a direct criticism to the

oppression of the Irish upon their culture.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#62:1> Through the use of satire, Swift's work calls out for political

action by the people to fight back.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#63:1> Very brilliantly composed, Swift's proposal is to actually have the

children of their society killed and sold for meat to wealthy families (

those that he perceives to be oppressors).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#64:1> His proposal in doing so is very <}> <-> <del> suscinct </del> </->

<+> <del> succinct </del> </+> </}> well-defined, thought out, and calculated

to the last detail.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#65:1> In <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> establishing this

cold, calculated <del> cold </del> plan to have the children sold for meat,

Swift makes his reader actually put credibility into what they are being

told.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#66:1> Despite the fact that it is extremely inhumane, the whole process of

giving human life a dollar value, not to mention that it is cannibalism. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#67:1> However, Swift points out the advantages to such a system.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#68:1> He claims that instead of being a burden to their families, and

starving to death anyway, they could actually create some profit for these

economically-ravished people.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#69:1> So, instead of feeding them and raising them, they could be sold off

for a good price at the appropriate time.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#70:1> It is not until one sits back and looks at what he is actually

proposing that you realize how barbaric it really is.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#71:1> Such is the depth and quality of the satire Swift creates.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#72:1> It really hits home when he <del> has </del> states that adults in

the society would have been thankful for such a system when they were

children.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#73:1> In this way Swift describes the severity of the conditions people are

living in.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#74:1> Perhaps Swift's best tool in capturing the reader is the dependence

on the cold-calculated efficiency of the whole proposal. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#75:1> Another social critique of his time was Alexander Pope.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#76:1> However, where Swift's satire is very serious-oriented and is a call

for political action, Pope's work is there to simply point out a problem that

he sees within society, primarily the way of women.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#77:1> Pope's main piece of literature in accomplishing this is " The Rape

of the Lock" which has obvious implications to explain the nature of women.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#78:1> It has often been claimed of Pope within this work that he is simply

making a mountain out of a mole hill, and to a large degree this is true.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#79:1> As previously stated, Pope is not interested in taking on this "

problem" as he sees it, but rather to just <quote> laugh at the little

unguarded follies of women </quote> <&> misquote </&> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#80:1> In order to accomplish this task, Pope uses irony to some degree.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#81:1> When Belinda has her hair cut off by <del> <.> Clary </.> </del>

Clarissa, it was while they were playing cards.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#82:1> Ironically, Belinda has a sprite of whose purpose is to protect her

chasteness and purity.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#83:1> While Clarissa is doing the cutting, Belinda ironically is thinking

of unchaste, impure thoughts and hence her protector ( the sprite Ariel)

cannot save her from her fate.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#84:1> Hence, it could be deduced from the work that women are in their

state due to their own choosing.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#85:1> Pope has often been acclaimed a <}> <-> massogenist </-> <+>

misogynist </+> </}> and there is definitely grounds for support there.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#86:1> However, this is Pope's social criticism and must be examined for

what it is. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#87:1> Belinda's reaction to her hair being cut is one that is promoted

as being highly out of proportion to the event, and in essence one of

childish behaviour.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#88:1> However, we do not take much sympathy as readers for her as it came

from her own <del> <.> un </.> </del> unchaste thoughts.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#89:1> In addition, the character of Clarissa is also important.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#90:1> She performs the act out of duty towards her <?> knight </?> which

also instills a certain portrayal of women in society at the time.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#91:1> More importantly, though, she did it out of spite and jealousy.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#92:1> Belinda's wealth has come at the hands of profitting from the

imperial colonization.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#93:1> So, again, Pope gives a social critique <del> that </del> not only of

women's nature but that the colonial process / experience is wrong. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#94:1> Pope's work then is a multi-faceted one <?> that </?> makes us

complicit to all of the little 'inside jokes', while at the same time

pointing out his criticisms of society. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#95:1> The final author I will study ( or examine) is Thomas More.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#96:1> His major work, Utopia <del> calls </del> displays an ideal society

as was experienced through the travels of a man called Hythloday.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#97:1> It is important to note, however that More was very disturbed at the

condition of his country, England, at the time of this book.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#98:1> What he does with Utopia then, is use the conception of an ideal

society and compares it with that of England.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#99:1> In doing so, the actual problems he perceived would be magnified, and

better exposed for those that read his work. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-012#100:1> Again, the story takes place <del> on </del> in an expedition by

a man called Hythloday ( which by definition means <del> <.> nonsen </.>

</del> teller of nonsense), and his discovery of an ideal society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#101:1> Hythloday reveals to us that it is on an island, and in doing so

proposes that perhaps such a system can only work in seclusion / isolation.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#102:1> It is in the shape of a crescent moon, and has a very good system of

defense from intruders.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#103:1> They operate under the principles of pure equality of citizens, with

the exception of the King ( Utopus).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#104:1> There are various and numerous other qualities about Utopia, such as

the fact that husband and wife get to see each other naked before they marry

so as to not have an unhappy marriage.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#105:1> Again, these aspects of Utopia are numerous.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-012#106:1> The important thing to remember is that whatever More has brought up

within his text, Utopia is related to a critique of his own regarding his own

society. </p> </I>
