<I>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#1:1> <h> PART ONE </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#2:1> <h> THE ERA OF EDIFICATION </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#3:1> In the era of Victoria and Edward, magazines were seen and saw

them <l> selves as instruments of moral and pedagogic improvement.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#4:1> Man was perfectible, and the periodicals he read would help perfect

him.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#5:1> In the view of George Stewart, a magazine <quote> " is a great

national university, diffused, without loss of effectiveness, throughout an

entire nation." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#6:1> At first the national status of magazines was doubtful.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#7:1> Writing in 1868, Henry James Morgan defended his listing of newspaper

editors and writers in his <it> Bibliotheca Canadensis </it> by saying, <X>

<quote> " In our young country ... our principal newspapers may be considered

as holding no unimpor <l> tant position in Literature.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#X8:1> We have not many periodicals of a purely literary kind; and the

morning journal may be said to be as much a literary as it is a political

organ ....
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#X9:1> Besides, the majority of our jour <l> nalists have been men of

superior education and literary culture, who have themselves written works

and pamphlets.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#X10:1> A very distinguished author has recently remarked <quote> 'that a

hundred years hence the newspaper will be the only possible book.' </quote> "

</quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#11:1> In the short or even long term the distinguished author was

proven wrong, but his prediction was not wildly unfounded.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#12:1> The nineteenth-century line between newspapers and magazines was

blurred.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#13:1> Newspapers published much poetry and fiction, but usually left

cartoons to magazines.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#14:1> Egerton Ryerson's <it> Christian Guardian </it> , the most important

church paper before Confederation, resembled a magazine in some respects and

was in fact the forerunner of the United Church's <it> New Outlook </it> and

<it> Observer </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#15:1> <it> Canadian Illustrated News </it> and <it> Grip </it> regarded

themselves as weekly papers, and <it> Saturday Night </it> began as one. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#16:1> Yet magazines, not books or newspapers, would emerge as the

national medium.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#17:1> Magazines were advertised and reviewed as if they were books, and,

for the writers of books, magazines were an indispens <l> able bridge to

their public.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#18:1> After or during a newspaper apprentice <l> ship, most fiction writers

began by contributing stories to magazines - for copyright reasons these were

usually British or U.S. magazines and continued to produce short stories and

serials while appearing between hard covers. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#19:1> The causes for <w> magazines' </w> prominence were relatively

simple.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#20:1> Newspapers, confined to cities and towns and often blindly partisan,

could not present a judicious national overview.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#21:1> Books lacked the maga <l> zine's continuity, usually only presented

one writer at a time and were beset by confused copyrights and unsatisfactory

economies of scale.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#22:1> With its built-in advantages, a magazine could be all things to all

Canadians. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#23:1> <quote> " All" </quote> is used advisedly.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#24:1> The founders and editors of magazines were class conscious, although

the class consisted not of the aristocracy, but of those who, through

diligence and intrinsic moral worth, proved them <l> selves eligible for

membership in an elite.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#25:1> The magazine's <quote> " mission," </quote> said George Stewart, <X>

<quote> " is to stimulate and afford expression to the higher thought and

tastes of a people, to bring the country's best thought, under the most

favourable circumstances and in the most attractive form, before the best

classes of the country's readers - the classes upon whom the shaping of the

political, social, intellectual and even industrial future of the nation most

largely depend." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#26:1> Stewart and his colleagues seemed to presuppose these natural

leaders ensconced in armchairs, puffing pipes and nodding gravely or smiling

gently in approval.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#27:1> For Stewart a good magazine is <quote> " reserved for the quietest

half hours of comfortable leisure, when the mind is in the most receptive

mood and most ready to respond to facts and arguments attractively and

candidly presented, or to the quiet touches of beauty, humour, pathos that

lighter literature furnishes...." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#28:1> Ribaldry was not part of the lighter touch; even humour had its

moral applications.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#29:1> Which is not to say that the Victorians were humorless.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#30:1> Besides <it> Grip </it> , their comic journals included <it> Punch in

Canada </it> - founded in 1848 in Montreal, it was the first to run regular

political cartoons - , <it> Diogenes, Grinchuckle, The Grumbler </it> and, in

the Edwardian period, Knox McGee's <it> Moon </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#31:1> Describing the struggle between the sacred and secu <l> lar and how

they might be reconciled was a constant in the higher-minded magazines,

especially those published by the churches but also in the popular press.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#32:1> It was the age, after all, of <it> Origin of Species </it> , and the

clergymen sometimes had to end in arguing that evolution itself was part of

God's ongoing design.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#33:1> The relationship between science and theology was tirelessly examined

and, only slightly less so, the gap between rich and poor.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#34:1> The latter was linked to the search for utopian panaceas like Henry

George's Single Tax, and not just in J. W. Ben <l> gough's Single-minded <it>

Grip </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#35:1> As W. J. Rattray noted in <it> Belford's Monthly </it> in May 1878,

<X> <quote> " Whatever sins of omission or commission may be fairly laid to

the charge of our age and generation, indifference to the momen <l> tous

problems of human life and destiny is not one of them ....
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#X36:1> Men are far too seriously-minded in their search after truth...to

treat the solemn questions which persistently obtrude themselves for solution

on every age, with levity, scorn or a flippant superficiality." </quote> </X>

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#37:1> In creating this edifying spectacle, the influence of the Scots

Presbyterians, those relentless educators of themselves and others, can <l>

not be overstated.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#38:1> With the merger of its sects in 1875, the Presbyterian church was

until 1925 the largest Protestant denomination.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#39:1> Many if not most of the printers, publishers and editors were Scots

and had all the characteristics of that enterprising, argumentative race.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#40:1> As Elizabeth Waterston has pointed out, Scotland created a battalion

of literary exemplars: Robert Burns for lyric poets, Sir Walter Scott for

historical romancers, Macaulay and Carlyle for the writers of <quote> " Great

Man" </quote> and thesis history, Robert Louis Stevenson for those who wrote

adventure stories for children, J. M. Barrie for those, like Ralph Connor and

L. M. Montgomery, who limned regional idylls. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#41:1> Literary taste tended to be conservative.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#42:1> Some editors like Graeme Mercer Adam deplored <quote> " the

intellectual vivisection methods" </quote> of Henry James and W. D. Howells

and <quote> " the loathsome realism and putridity" </quote> of Emile Zola and

Anatole France.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#43:1> As Claude Bissell says in the <it> Liter <l> ary History of Canada

</it> , in poetry the Canadian critic and writer disliked <quote> " technical

experimentation, the intellectual, any suggestion of the com <l> monplace and

the realistic." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#44:1> Desired <quote> " were elegance of diction, nobil <l> ity of

sentiment, and clarity and picturesqueness of observation." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#45:1> Despite the bows made to poetry and fiction, what the editors

took most seriously was intellectual debate.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#46:1> The great issues - the conflict <l> ing claims of science and

religion, the overriding question of whether Canada would meld, even merge

with the United States - were end <l> lessly debated.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#47:1> In retrospect, free traders and protectionists, annexa <l> tionists

and imperialists all seem utopians.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#48:1> The free traders and annexationists imagined that a north-south flow

would produce noth <l> ing but prosperity.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#49:1> The imperialists supposed not just that their coun <l> try would have

a magnificent future, but that it would become a partner or even leader in an

ever more glorious British Empire. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#50:1> One debate was about how magazines themselves would take form.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#51:1> The imperialist ( and future knight) J. G. Bourinot, for many years

the clerk of the House of Commons and a frequent contributor to periodi <l>

cals, wrote that <X> <quote> No doubt there is room in the Dominion for a

magazine com <l> bining the features of <quote> 'Blackwood,' </quote> the

<quote> 'Contemporary' </quote> and the <quote> 'Quarterly Review' </quote> ;

that is to say, poetry, fiction, criti <l> cism, reviews of topics of the

day, and in fact, original liter <l> ary effort of the higher order, which,

though mostly ephemeral in its character, must have much influence for the

time being on the culture and the education of the public mind ... if such a

venture is to succeed hereafter it must have behind it sufficient capital to

engage the assistance of the best Canadian writers, who now send their work

to American and British periodicals.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#X52:1> Such a magazine must be carefully edited, and not made the

dumping-ground for the crude efforts of literary dabblers or for romantic

gush and twaddle .... </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#53:1> That Bourinot, an expert on constitutional history, could comment

authoritatively on literary matters was typical.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#54:1> Victorians could com <l> ment authoritatively on <it> anything </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#55:1> They were not narrow specialists, but took the world's mind and

actions for their domain.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#56:1> Literature was not just poetry, fiction and <indig> <it> belles

lettres </it> </indig> , but anything in which verbal analysis and narrative

held sway.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#57:1> Limited as their aesthetic concep <l> tions may have been, they did

see humanity as a whole, and the best magazines they founded and wrote for

had the same consonance and comprehensiveness. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#58:1> <h> Pre-Confederation Clusters </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#59:1> If the magazines prior to Confederation were usually short-lived,

at least there were a lot of them.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#60:1> Solemnly conceived, desperately hopeful, they were pioneering and

they knew it.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#61:1> The age of advertising had yet to arrive, and they relied on

pitifully few subscribers.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#62:1> To a modern reader it is a confusing world of innumerable titular

changes and contribu <l> tors who were anonymous, pseudonymous or hidden

behind initials.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#63:1> Colonial, these magazines heavily reprinted material from Britain and

the United States, at the same time as they were tracing the faint outlines

of a new culture. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#64:1> Magazines in what is now Canada were not spontaneously generated

by Confederation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#65:1> If Confederation marked the birth of a big nation it also tolled the

death of little ones.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#66:1> The eastern British North Ameri <l> can colonies were, after all,

embryonic independent nations, and ones whose periodicals aspired to serve

self-contained publics. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#67:1> The first magazine to appear in British North America was

Halifax's <it> Nova Scotia Magazine and Comprehensive Review of Literature,

Politics and News </it> ( 1789-92).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#68:1> It reached 200 subscribers - including judges, sur <l> geons and the

Bishop of Nova Scotia - and was printed on a wooden screw press by John Howe,

father of the famous Joseph, who also sold it over the counter of his office

( eighteenth- and nineteenth-century bookshops were often run in conjunction

with a press and journal).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#69:1> Edited by the Reverend William Cochran, the magazine had some local

content, though much of it was reprints.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#70:1> There then followed in the Maritimes such initiatives as the <it>

Nova Scotia and New Brunswick or Historical, Literary, Theological and

Miscellaneous Repository; Acadian Magazine and Literary Mirror; New Brunswick

Religious and Literary Jour <l> nal; The Pearl; Halifax Monthly Magazine;

</it> and <it> Nova Scotia New Monthly Magazine </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#71:1> Most had varying titles and were located in Halifax or Saint John.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#72:1> None lasted more than two years. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#73:1> The most interesting of these, because of the people behind them,

were <it> Mayflower, or Ladies Acadian Newspaper </it> ( 1851-2) and <it>

Provincial, or Halifax Monthly </it> ( 1852-53).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#74:1> Mary Eliza Herbert, the nineteen-year-old daughter of an immigrant

Irish blacking manufacturer, published <it> The Mayflower </it> as a

thirty-two-page publication in May 1851, seeking readers in those wishing

<quote> " to roam a while in the flowery fields of romance - to hold

communion with the Muses." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#75:1> As the first female edi <l> tor of a magazine in British North

America, Herbert narrowly beat out Mary Jane Lawson <it> <indig> n&eacute;e

</indig> </it> Katzmann.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#76:1> At twenty-four, Katzmann, the poet <l> ical daughter of a German and

his New England wife, became the <it> Provincial's </it> editor.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#77:1> Aiming for a wider audience - male as well as female - she drew more

from regional writers than had Herbert and had higher cultural and social

ambitions for her audience. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#78:1> In Quebec the first magazine had been started in 1792, the

bilingual <it> Quebec Magazine <it> ( <indig> Magasin de Qu&eacute;bec; ou,

Recueil utile et amusant de Litt&eacute;rature, histoire, politique, etc.,

particuli&egrave;rement adapt&eacute; &agrave; l'usage de l'Am&eacute;rique.

</indig> </it>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#79:1> In its less than two years of life the Quebec City periodical was

edited by Alexander Spark on the press of the Neilson family, prominent in

Quebec printing for the next half-century or more. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#80:1> In the Canadas, magazines trailed, doglike, the growth of

population, though the potential audience was always small.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#81:1> In the 1840s, the market for a Toronto periodical might extend east

to Montreal and south to New York State, but was mainly confined to the

province's half-million widely dispersed inhabitants.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#82:1> The later distinctions among farm, church and literary magazines were

smudged.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#83:1> Agricultural papers were the first family magazines, and the

Anglican, Presbyterian and Methodist church journals often had literary

content.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#84:1> Still, there were certain fast divisions between country and town.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#85:1> Those who aspired to gentility might turn to magazines with titles

like the <it> Canadian Gem and Family Visitor </it> ; the more

practical-minded might opt for the <it> Cana <l> dian Agricultural Journal

</it> ( Montreal, 1848-68). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#86:1> Whatever the magazine's tack, the power inherent in the press had

come permanently, if at first precariously, to reside along the Great Lakes

and the southern edge of the Laurentian Shield. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#87:1> In Montreal, the foremost city, Samuel Hull Wilcocke ( <quote> "

Lewis Luke MacCulloh, Esquire" </quote> ) edited the iconoclastic <it> The

Scribbler: A Series of Weekly Essays on Literary, Critical, Satirical, Moral,

and Local Subjects, interspersed with pieses of Poetry </it> ( 1822-27),

which shifted to nearby Rouses Point in Vermont after its first year.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#88:1> In Montreal, Nahum Mower printed the monthly <it> Canadian Magazine

and Literary Repository </it> ( 1823-25), which amounted to four volumes of

almost six hundred pages each, and David Chisholme, a Scot, edited the

quartely <it> Canadian Review and Literary and Historical Journal </it> (

1824-26), which published <quote> " The Rising Village" </quote> by Oliver

Goldsmith, grand-nephew of the playwright and novelist who had been Dr.

Johnson's friend. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#89:1> In Upper Canada, where John Strachan attempted the <it> Christian

Examiner </it> ( 1819-20), the first illustrated periodical was the <it>

Canadian Literary Magazine </it> ( 1833).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#90:1> Published by George Gurnett in York ( Toronto), each issue had an

engraved portrait, <quote> " the first we believe," </quote> said the editor,

<quote> " ... ever engraved in Upper Canada - engraved too on Canadian stone,

and from thence, by means of a Canadian press, trans <l> ferred to Canadian

paper." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-004#91:1> Counting both Canadas, before 1850 there were magazines in

Montreal, York, Kingston, Brockville, Cobourg and Hamilton.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#92:1> From a literary viewpoint, the most important was the <it> literary

Garland </it> ( 1835-51) in Montreal, published by John Lovell and edited by

his brother-in-law John Gibson.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#93:1> Whichever literati the Canadas possessed were published in the <it>

Garland </it> : John Richardson, Charles Sangster, Rosanna Leprohon, Anna

Jameson, Catherine Parr Traill and her sister, Susanna Moodie.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#94:1> The Belleville wife of the former Endlish officer and ne'er-do-well

farmer Dunbar Moodie, Susanna even edited a magazine herself, rather

pathetically entitled <it> Victoria Magazine: A Cheap Periodi <l> cal for the

Canadian People </it> ( 1847-48), and contributed serialized excerpts from

novels, poems, even a song to the <it> Garland </it> ( the first magazine to

regularly publish musical scores).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-004#95:1> In its second year, it began to pub <l> lish lithographs of

landscapes, children and well-dressed citizens, with tissue-paper overlays to

preserve the pictures for framing, though these expensive trappings were

dropped in 1849 for reasons of economy. </p> </I>
