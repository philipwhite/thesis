<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#3:1:A> Ya that's a little <,> <{1> <[1> nook </[1> there
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#4:1:A> <{2> <[2> we </[2> can put those shelves

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#6:1:B> <[2> Ya </[2> </{2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#7:1:A> Well this is twelve inches deep

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#8:1:B> Ya

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#9:1:A> So we can either <{> <[> <unclear> words <&> a phrase that is

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#10:1:B> <[> You know what there is <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#12:1:A> <[> Yup ya ya </[> </{>

some of the leftover plywood if you want to make the shelves for the nook

</}> </-> <=> what do you mean to make the shelves </=> </}>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#19:1:A> Well if it's half inch plywood that they're using for the wall

<{1> <[1> <,,> </[1> that we have to cut <,> like here okay <,> we need two

pieces <,,> but we're only using a few inches of the second one
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#20:1:A> <{2> <[2> <,,> </[2> so unless <}> <-> we can use it </-> <=> we

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#21:1:B> <[1> Ya </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#22:1:B> <[2> Mhhm </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#24:1:B> Ya get them <,> get <?> something </?> <,,> hmm <,> ya <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#25:1:B> Well I found uhm <,,> a couple of brackets <,> you know holders <{>

<[> <,> </[> that <?> let </?> to fit <unclear> words </unclear> to fit into

it

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#26:1:A> <[> Ya </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#27:1:B> We found three of those uh individual but not as nice as that

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#28:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#29:1:B> I guess <{> <[> I'll have to <unclear> words </unclear> </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#30:1:A> <[> You don't necessarily want </[> </{> this kind

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#31:1:B> No <,> no that would be <{> <[> very </[> strong

<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#33:1:A> No

that hold up <unclear> word </unclear> <,> like that <,> like that
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#35:1:B> Well <,,> <?> for </?> this you figure is really <}> <-> gonna </->

<+> going to </+> </}> be the tricky bit huh

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#36:1:A> Yup yup
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#37:1:A> Cos that's where the complicated cutting comes in <,,> and that's

where you have all those wires and pipes and uh

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#38:1:B> Ya but remember they're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+>

</}> do it on the inside

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#39:1:A> Ya

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#40:1:B> So <?> it's really </?> <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#41:1:A> <[> Mhhm </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#42:1:A> That's true

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#45:1:A> Mhhm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#46:1:B> That's really <,,> well
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#47:1:B> Well

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#48:1:A> And then do you want to paint it <,,> on your side anyway

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#49:1:B> Ya

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#50:1:A> So

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#51:1:B> Talked about it <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#52:1:B> <}> <-> I'm <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> put <,> I

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#53:1:A> Yes

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#54:1:B> Ya

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#55:1:A> Yup you're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> mount

that down there

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#56:1:B> Where

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#57:1:A> In that part of the basement

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#58:1:B> It occurred to me that you know that <}> <-> <}> <-> if </->

<=> if </=> </}> it </-> <=> all it needs </=> </}> is to just have something

to hold it up <,,> really

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#59:1:A> Oh ya

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#60:1:B> There's nothing to putting it up

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#61:1:A> No the box is down there already
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#62:1:A> Right
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#63:1:A> You showed me the box
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#64:1:A> There's an electrical box in <{> <[> the </[> ceiling and

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#65:1:B> <[> Ya </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#66:1:B> Oh ya that's right
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#67:1:B> <{> <[> Well </[> no this one I think this is uhm the <?> set </?>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#68:1:A> <[> Ya </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#69:1:A> Oh so you just plug <unclear> word </unclear> <{> <[>

<unclear> word </unclear> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#70:1:B> <[> No this doesn't even get </[> </{> fitted into a box

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#71:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#72:1:B> <}> <-> In fact <.> th </.> </-> <=> and there are two of them

<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#73:1:B> There's that one <}> <-> which is </-> <=> and then there is

another one which is about half the length </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#74:1:B> So I thought that what I'd do <unclear> word </unclear> that the

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#75:1:A> <[> Mhhm </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#76:1:B> And I thought that what I would do is put the laundry room

<,,> in here sort of going that way <{> <[> <,> </[> and the <?> shower room

</?> in here going that way

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#77:1:A> <[> Ya </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#78:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#79:1:B> And then over here there is that box <{> <[> and so I could

just get him to fit in something </[> ya

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#80:1:A> <[> Right so you just get <unclear> word </unclear> something

</[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#81:1:A> And then maybe <{> <[> get something </[> <,> for above the

washer-dryer

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#82:1:B> <[> And then </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#83:1:B> You know there is something actually right above the

washer-dryer

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#84:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#85:1:B> There is <}> <-> there's a </-> <=> it's not working but

there's uhm </=> </}>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#86:1:A> Oh that's right the one with the <{> <[> broken <unclear> word

</unclear> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#87:1:B> <[> Ya ya </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#89:1:A> <[> Yup </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#92:1:B> <[> Mhhm </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#93:1:B> Well ya cos there's this <,> you know <}> <-> the </-> <=> that

there at all

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#94:1:A> You might put one <}> <-> in the </-> <=> in the </=> </}>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#95:1:B> Ya I've got that lamp <,> that I use now over the uh

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#96:1:A> Mhhm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#97:1:B> So all I really need <}> <-> is </-> <=> is </=> </}> places

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#224:1:A> Well it wouldn't be convenient for you <{> <[> on the second

<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#229:1:B> Everytime I go down there I just <,,> you know I just try to <,,>

realize what it's all going to look like

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#230:1:A> Of course to make it even bigger you could knock that little

room down <,,> and open up that space <,,> if you're walling off <,> this

whole area

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#231:1:B> Ya but then <}> <-> I uh </-> <=> taking </=> </}> down walls

doesn't it

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#232:1:A> But you don't have any shelves on those walls <{> <[> do you

</[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#236:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#237:1:B> I've got uhh those <,,> plastic milk <,> crates <,> you <{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#238:1:A> <[> Oh ya </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#239:1:A> Well those could still be lined up against the back wall <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#240:1:A> I can see this is not a popular <{> <[> idea </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#241:1:B> <[> Well </[> </{> no the thing is that <}> <-> if I </-> <=>

<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#245:1:A> Ya that's true

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#249:1:B> I don't know

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#251:1:B> Ya see what I'm thinking of doing is taking you know all

these books that I have over here <{1> <[1> <,,> </[1> that are sitting uh

you know on the other side the washing machine
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#252:1:B> <{2> <[2> there </[2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#253:1:A> <[1> Ya </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#254:1:A> <[2> Mhhm </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#255:1:B> <}> <-> It </-> <=> you know it seems to me </=> </}> that

this would be a big enough space to hold it cos <}> <-> it </-> <=> it's </=>

</}> wide here

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#256:1:A> Oh ya it is

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#257:1:B> You know

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#258:1:A> Yup

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#259:1:B> So <,> <}> <-> it </-> <=> it </=> </}> really could take all

of the books and I think that would be a better place for them cos they're

close to the washing machine
<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#260:1:B> And I don't know if it <,,> you know when it's hot <{1> <[1> water

</[1> there's steam and <}> <->

it seems to me that

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#263:1:A> <[2> Ya </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#264:1:B> <}> <-> So I guess that all of that <,,> </-> <=> you're

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-004#266:1:B> You know I might think about it actually

<ICE-CAN:S1A-004#273:1:A> Ya

redistribute these lights
