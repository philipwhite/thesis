<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#1:1> <h> <ul> LETTER TO THE QUEBEC COUNCIL OF BISHOPS </ul> ( <}> <-> Nov.

</-> <+> November </+> </}> 1996) </h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#2:1> <h> <ul> Introduction </ul> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-025#3:1> While separation of Church and State is a concept which has been

assimilated in Canada, and we may agree that the government should not

interfere in religion, and although some may feel that in Quebec the clergy

have historically aroused resentment by exercising wide authority on matters

both religious and secular, still it is both false and destructive to hold

that faith and religious truth should play no role in interpreting political

events, or that the Church should have nothing to say in the affairs which

determine our lives.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#4:1> There occur from time to time political events and situations which

involve focused and easily discerned spiritual values.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#5:1> The roles of the Churches in Nazi Germany has been much written about.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#6:1> Their roles in Yugoslavia and in Ireland will eventually be studied in

the same way.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#7:1> Christendom is on display, and not all the Churches appear to have

been true to themselves.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#8:1> We would suggest that Quebec is, at this time, involved in one of

those moments where the Churches, and specifically the Catholic Church, are

challenged to show their colours .. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-025#9:1> All Quebecers are suffering the same prolonged uncertainty, and

same experience of endless conflict.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#10:1> But there may be a value in presenting this spiritual malaise from

the specific viewpoint of English Speaking Catholics because we are a

minority, and because we may experience these years somewhat differently than

will the French-speaking majority.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#11:1> Moreover it is important that English-speaking Catholics understand

and feel that the Church in its hierarchy is not indifferent to their

spiritual welfare, but is informed and is actively interested in it, even

though they are a minority in the Quebec Church.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#12:1> For this reason we turn to the Bishops of Quebec for leadership, and

we trust that just as English-speaking and French-speaking Bishops cooperate

in the Church, so they will be able to lead the various parishes and other

groupings of the faithful to those resources of our heritage which we share

and which enable us to respect and love one another. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-025#13:1> It must be said that the religious education which we have

received was centered on self-denial, on obligations to the Church, on purity

of life, and on loving one's brother and sister.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#14:1> There was little catechesis about political responsibility, about

social justice, about community leadership, about patriotism, about violence

and warfare.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#15:1> In recent decades this deficiency has become apparent. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#16:1> <h> <ul> National Pride </ul> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-025#17:1> Patriotism is an important feeling, and a major ethical

commitment.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#18:1> For a person who has lost all sense of God and religion, patriotism

can easily absorb religious values and lead to political fanaticism.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#19:1> We have seen even secular culture criticizing patriotism, because the

first half of this century was marked by its excesses.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#20:1> But for people of faith, patriotism is an important formative value

through which an individual breaks out beyond instinctive love of self and

family and race based on blood, and beyond interpersonal love of men and

women, to wider horizons of commitment and charity.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#21:1> Patriotic values lead very naturally to the horizons of love of God,

and we can see that mankind has regularly linked the name of God to national

expressions of loyalty.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#22:1> This kind of love is powerful, and its relation to love of God is a

crucial point where religious faith can be confused with idolatry.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#23:1> Reflection, spiritual discernment, and clear instruction in this area

are badly needed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-025#24:1> English-speaking Catholics have a specific problem in this

regard.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#25:1> Often we come from families which, however rooted in Quebec, have

also lived in two or more provinces in Canada over some generations.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#26:1> Our hearts warm when we sing " <indig> Gens du pays </indig> " in

celebrating Quebec, but they also burst with pride when we sing " Oh Canada"

at the Olympic games, or at flag-raisings.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#27:1> Our English-language television news, our magazines, and our <}> <->

newpapers </-> <+> newspapers </+> </}> bring us daily stories from right

across Canada, and our general image of this countries includes Provinces

with their friendly rivalries.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#28:1> Our feelings of patriotism and national pride are centered on Canada

and the Canadian flag and institutions.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#29:1> The threat to simply take Canadian citizenship from us, along with

the relentless defamation we hear daily in public discourse about " the rest

of Canada" and all its institutions, is a radical shock.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#30:1> It is very similar to a threat to take our family away from us and a

public defamation of our dear ones.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#31:1> This is not a financial theft.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#32:1> This is a destruction of our heart at a very deep level. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-025#33:1> St. Paul taught that there was no longer any more to be Jew or

Greek, but only followers of Jesus.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#34:1> And it is true that some times the religious conversion attendant

upon " finding Jesus" does imply a leaving of one's native land.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#35:1> Should this be the asceticism recommended to English-speaking

Catholics?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#36:1> In the book of Ruth, Naomi is praised for leaving her Moabite origin

and becoming a Jew in Israel out of love for her mother-in-law.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#37:1> Is this a model of spirituality to recommend in Quebec?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#38:1> This is not a clever question.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#39:1> It is a choice which separation plans for our future.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#40:1> The alternatives could, in a very few years, be either to leave

Quebec, or to prepare for violence in Quebec.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#41:1> Our priests say nothing of this.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#42:1> They will need the guidance of the larger Church, and specifically of

the Bishops, to sort this question out. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-025#43:1> The problem is made more acute in that our friends and often our

immediate family have left for other provinces, or are planning to leave.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#44:1> Many of us live in areas where virtually all the houses carry " for

sale" signs, because even those who are not leaving now are hoping

desperately to sell their house ( at a 15 to 20% loss!), so that they can be

free to leave at a later date.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#45:1> This is not just one bad year to get through, and shrug off.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#46:1> It has been going on so long now that most of us take it as a solid

reality.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#47:1> No one wants to leave, and most cannot leave because of financial and

employment limitations.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#48:1> Many of our families have parents and grand parents for generations

back buried here, and the choice is to leave and be cut off from our roots,

or to stay and be cut off from our future.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#49:1> This is a bit of death, and a bit of torture, and over time it

becomes despair.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#50:1> What hope can the Church offer, drawing upon its spirituality and

theological resources? </p>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#51:1> <h> <ul> Managing anger </ul> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#52:1>

<p> One natural response is anger at the source of this suffering.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#53:1> Anger is an important energy for fighting evil.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#54:1> However, we also know another anger, the anger which lurks in our

psyches and threatens our self-control, disturbs our capacity for judgement

and fills our minds.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#55:1> Scripture compares it to a lion which crouches at the door wanting to

consume us, but which we can and must conquer. ( Gen 4:6-7)
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#56:1> The media often equate anger with courage, and make it the path to

victory.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#57:1> Of course conflict sells newspapers, and many individuals find

personal advantage or gratification in inciting anger and hatred among their

friends or among their enemies.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#58:1> And one recurring pathology of crowds is the lust to feel they are

cast in the role of victims, or of avengers.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#59:1> One hears this tone now on the radio, both French and English, every

day, and worsening from month to month.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#60:1> And yet it is hardly mentioned in the pulpit.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#61:1> The silence in the Church about this is astonishing.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#62:1> Should not the Bishops take the initiative in facing this evil. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#63:1> <h> <ul> The loss of truth </ul> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-025#64:1> Another problem is the loss of public trust.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#65:1> Society is based on mutual confidence, on the expectation of truth

and justice in public forums.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#66:1> The loss of religion and of self-transcending values in Quebec has

naturally <}> <-> weakend </-> <+> weakened </+> </}> expectation of public

truth and public trust.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#67:1> Moreover, the incredible mushrooming of public communication through

modern media, communication which is 70% fiction, 10% information, and 20%

deception through various kinds of advertising and news as entertainment, has

flooded our intelligence to the point where we have learned to float on

systematic scepticism.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#68:1> When you can never get to the truth of anything, you train yourself

to live without it.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#69:1> But in Quebec the drive for independence has so shaped political

debate as to exacerbate this scepticism to a dangerous point.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#70:1> Independence apparently won't be achieved or rejected by simple

negotiation or honest argument.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#71:1> It requires constant posturing for leverage in bargaining position,

constant manipulation of language and " spinning" of news stories, constant

blurring of lines between politics and law, constant tricking of the public.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-025#72:1> Deception is better than violence.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#73:1> But it has been going on for so many years that we have lost track of

what is normal, and have come to accept that political debate be a special

exercise in suspended disbelief.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#74:1> Nobody trusts public statements or facts.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#75:1> Instead, we systematically look for the deception, and base our

decisions on instincts rather than reason.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#76:1> We no longer know or even want to know.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#77:1> Once again, this is not a sickness to be endured for a month or two,

like the Presidential election in the United States.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#78:1> Our poor brains have been so occupied and rotted in this exercise,

that either apathy or despair seems to be the lot of anybody who reads <}>

<-> newpapers </-> <+> newspapers </+> </}> or watches news on television on

a regular basis.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#79:1> It is no wonder that the light of eternal truths often fail to touch

brains exhausted and steeped in endless lies.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#80:1> This is not a small matter.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#81:1> Human capacity for truth, and desire for truth, is one of God's

greatest gifts.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#82:1> The pleasures of the mind are the truly human pleasures which

constitute beatitude in this life.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#83:1> There is a profound rage building up over this.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#84:1> The media tell us that we are angry at politicians.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#85:1> The fact is that the anger is about politicians and media equally.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#86:1> In this case, the rage is appropriate.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#87:1> The lying is outrageous. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-025#88:1> Has the Church something to offer on the topic of public lying?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#89:1> Is political deception a fine art or a moral failure?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#90:1> Can the Church articulate a serious ideal of honesty in public

discourse?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#91:1> Can the Church identify and define real values in society, and ask

politicians to address these directly and simply?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#92:1> Must we allow governments to avoid focusing on the visible problems

of poverty and misery in this city, or the general problem of joblessness,

because their failures will then be evident.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#93:1> Let all our speech be aye aye, or nay nay, we are told in the New

Testament.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#94:1> The media chide spin-doctors among politicians, but spinning is their

own trade.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#95:1> In a time of crisis the value of unspun truths, tracked down with

diligence and determination, would be enormous. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-025#96:1> And it would be hard to overestimate the demoralization in the

English-speaking community when it was discovered that even our ballots have

been manipulated.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#97:1> For centuries the secret ballot has been " the moment of truth" in

our society, when each citizen in complete privacy makes a free choice.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#98:1> There is a mystique to that act which approaches the sacred.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#99:1> Violation of that act is an intimate violence.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#100:1> But it is hard for us to believe that even Bishops have been so

inured to public deception as to be unable to perceive and condemn this evil.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-025#101:1> With all this loss of truth society builds on sand, unstable and

fearful.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#102:1> And through the silence of the Church the voice of every demagogue

is heard and every leader finds anxious crowds needing to be led.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#103:1> We appeal to the Bishops to speak out about public trust, and to

give the Church her voice. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#104:1> <h> <ul> An opportunity </ul> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-025#105:1> At this point in Quebec history, it is astonishing that the

Quebec Church appear to be so quiet and so calm, as though nothing very

special were occurring.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#106:1> It is as though Christendom were asleep during a storm at sea.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#107:1> In the very near future either separation or major reconciliation

will have occurred, and the Quebec economy will have experienced a radical

redefinition for better or for worse.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-025#108:1> Violence, or even the beginning of chronic violence, could easily

arise. </p> </I>
