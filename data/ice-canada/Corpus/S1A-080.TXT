he </-> </}> just <}> <-> can't </-> <,,> <=> can't </=> </}> handle that

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#159:1:B> Ya <,,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#160:1:A> Uhm so <}> <-> we just </-> <=> we </=> </}> talked about

that <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#161:1:A> So that only like two days ago <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#162:1:A> We didn't talk about much
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#163:1:A> It was very casual it's like <,> while we're like <,> doing the

dishes <{> <[> or something </[> it's not

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#164:1:B> <[> Mhm </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#165:1:B> Ya I was wondering <{> <[> if it isn't some kind of crisis

</[> coming or something

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#166:1:A> <[> It's not even like this </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#167:1:B> If he'd uh <,,> <}> <-> y'know </-> <+> you know </+> </}>

just recently been thinking about it
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#168:1:B> If there was something
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#169:1:B> Cos if <.> he </.> <{> <[> <}> <-> it's not not </-> <=> it's not

that </=> </}> </[> <,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#170:1:A> <[> It's not bad news that he talked about </[> </{> it <,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#171:1:B> No but it's not the type of stuff that he normally talks to

<@> Matt </@> about
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#172:1:B> I guess maybe they haven't been alone and having a conversation

along those <{> <[> <unclear> three or four words </unclear> </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#173:1:A> <[> I know I'm always on his case </[> </{> to have a friend

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#174:1:B> Ya

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#175:1:A> <}> <-> y'know </-> <+> you know </+> </}> so maybe he's <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#176:1:A> How did it come up <,,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#177:1:B> I have no idea
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#178:1:B> I didn't <}> <-> get </-> <=> really get </=> </}> a chance to

talk to <@> Matt </@> about it
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#179:1:B> Just out of the clear blue he just <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#180:1:B> <@> Brian </@> mentioned his dad and said that he died at sixty

isn't that bizarre and he started to tell me a little bit about how he died
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#181:1:B> Cos I didn't realize that he had <,,> died when he went in for

<,,> uh his <.> oper </.> you know a lung <,> <{> <[> operation </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#182:1:A> <[> Ya </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#183:1:A> He had the lung transplant

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#184:1:B> Ya <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#185:1:B> See I didn't realize that
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#186:1:B> I thought he <,,> had died just from severe asthma

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#187:1:A> No <,> <{> <[> <O> clear throat </O> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#188:1:B> <[> And uh </[> </{> <{> <[> so </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#189:1:A> <[> Totally </[> </{> fit eh <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#190:1:A> His lungs were totally <{1> <[1> fucked </[1> but this
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#191:1:A> <{2> <[2> man </[2> was like totally fit

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#192:1:B> <[1> Ya </[1> </{1>

<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#199:1:A> Like he knew for years that his lungs were going right
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#200:1:A> And the doctors had told himstop farming <{> <[> <,,> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#201:1:B> <[> Mhm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#202:1:A> <}> <-> Y'know </-> <+> you know </+> </}> stop farming

<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#207:1:A> <?> Oh </?> on Christmas we went there when I first started living

with him <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#208:1:A> And <}> <-> he went in </-> <=> <,> he went in </=> </}> and he

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#209:1:A> I mean it was a great <,,> picture

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-080#210:1:B> <[> Mhm </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-080#211:1:B> But I mean he was sick for like days after that <,> because <,>
