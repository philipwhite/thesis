<$A> <}> <->
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#1:1:A> Well <@> Doug </@> </-> <=> we squashed <@> Doug's </@> little

account of what's going on there with Galileo into one of those little one

minute news reports but we've got a little bit more of him explaining <,>

just what Galileo is and what the scientists hope they're going to get back

from it </=> </}>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-007#2:1:B> Galileo is a product of the time that astronomers call the

golden age of planetary exploration
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#3:1:B> Back in the nineteen sixties and seventies when budgets were higher

<,,> a fleet of intelligent sophisticated robots were sent out to survey the

solar system
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#4:1:B> And there were always two
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#5:1:B> Viking one and two went to Mars orbited the planet mapped it then

sent landers down on the surface that <,> tasted the soil looked for life

took full colour stereo pictures
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#6:1:B> Voyager one and two did the grand tour of the solar system visiting

Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#7:1:B> And seeing more than fifty moons along the way
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#8:1:B> Many that had never even been seen before
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#9:1:B> Galileo was to be the next step
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#10:1:B> It was to go to Jupiter and stay there
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#11:1:B> Orbit the planet
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#12:1:B> Look at it over a long period of time and for the first time <,>

sample <,> that <,> atmosphere
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#13:1:B> Send a probe right down into it
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#14:1:B> Well with budget cuts and all of the other economic realities that

hit NASA there was only one Galileo
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#15:1:B> So the astronomers were forced to put all of their eggs in one

basket
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#16:1:B> And because of that it's been a frustratingly long wait <,> for

them
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#17:1:B> Right from the beginning <,> Galileo was delayed
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#18:1:B> If it had gone according to its original schedule it would have

already been over ten years ago
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#19:1:B> It was supposed to fly in nineteen eighty-two and it was only

supposed to take two years to get to Jupiter
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#20:1:B> Well delays in the program put it back to nineteen eighty-six
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#21:1:B> Then <,,> the Challenger disaster with the space shuttle which blew

up
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#22:1:B> That put the program back to nineteen eighty-nine
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#23:1:B> By that time they had to find a different way of going to Jupiter
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#24:1:B> One that took six years instead of two
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#25:1:B> So for some of the astronomers who've been working on this program

they've been waiting almost eighteen years for this one mission
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#26:1:B> And for those who've been waiting for the data from the probe <,>

all of that wait comes down to just over an hour
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#27:1:B> Seventy-five minutes is the only time that that probe is going to

be sending back data before it's crushed <,> by that Jupiter atmosphere
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#28:1:B> And even after the spacecraft was on its way there had been

problems that have plagued the poor Galileo spacecraft
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#29:1:B> Its main antenna which unfolds like a big umbrella <,> got caught

on a metal strap so it doesn't have the proper shape to be able to send

signals at the earth
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#30:1:B> So they have to use a very slow back up antenna
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#31:1:B> And they had to cut down the number of pictures down from fifty

thousand that they were hoping to take <,> down to maybe three or four

thousand
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#32:1:B> At the same time they've had to rely on a tape recorder that <,>

can store the data and send it back at this slow rate
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#33:1:B> And the tape recorder jammed and almost broke <,> so now they're

being very ginger with that to make sure that it works
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#34:1:B> But even though it's had its delays and had its problems and it's

had frustrations and everyone is biting their nails as it finally gets to

Jupiter <,> Galileo has done some remarkable things
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#35:1:B> While it was on its way to Jupiter it took the very first movie <,>

of <,> the earth turning
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#36:1:B> Which is a rather remarkable thing when you think about it
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#37:1:B> We'd never seen the Earth turn
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#38:1:B> We'd seen it from space but never actually moving
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#39:1:B> Galileo did that
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#40:1:B> It also saw the first <,> asteroids
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#41:1:B> We'd known they had been out there
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#42:1:B> We've never seen them close up
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#43:1:B> It passed two of them on the way here and even found a little tiny

moon going around an asteroid
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#44:1:B> A total surprise to everyone
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#45:1:B> And while the amount of data Galileo brings back might be limited

<,> it's still exciting because we've never been inside Jupiter
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#46:1:B> For me I've been there throughout this entire exploration of the

solar system
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#47:1:B> I've seen the <}> <-> <.> pict </.> </-> <+> pictures </+> </}> <&>

tape cut out </&> live from the planets and seen worlds that have never been

seen by human eyes
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#48:1:B> And you relate to these spacecraft almost like pets
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#49:1:B> They're out there in this very hostile environment
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#50:1:B> They have a hard time
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#51:1:B> You hope they survive and you kind of encourage them on
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#52:1:B> Come on Galileo you can make it you can do it you can go there
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#53:1:B> So I wish Galileo well <,> and hope it succeeds in its mission

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-007#54:1:A> That's <@> Doug Mackenzie </@> host of Quirks and Quarks our

National Science Program here on <}> <-> C B <.> Ra </.> </-> <=> C B C Radio

</=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#55:1:A> That can be heard every Saturday right after the noon news weather

and sports uhh right after well it's nine minutes a nice package of

information there and then Quirks and Quarks comes on with <@> Doug Mackenzie

</@> here on C B C nine forty in Montreal </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#56:2:A> Ah Canadiens are playing in Pittsburgh tonight so the test

continues for them
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#57:2:A> And we keep saying that and it would have been a test for Mario

Tremblay anyway with Patrick Roy in the line up had they gotten along

famously
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#58:2:A> Fact is they're not
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#59:2:A> They're facing Mario Lemieux tonight <,> in Pittsburgh
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#60:2:A> Should be a very tough game for Montreal
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#61:2:A> Patrick Roy will probably get the start for the Avalanche tonight
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#62:2:A> They are at home <,> against the Edmonton Oilers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#63:2:A> And the Avalanche play very well at home
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#64:2:A> They've only lost once there all season long
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#65:2:A> Among the eight games in the N H L tonight
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#66:2:A> One in Quebec major junior hockey
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#67:2:A> Sherbrooke is at Drummondville
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#68:2:A> And for boxing the Canadian Amateur Championships get under way

today in Brampton Ontario
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#69:2:A> Ninety men and fifteen women will try and qualify for the Team

Canada that goes to the nineteen ninety-six Atlanta Olympics
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#70:2:A> And Canada's top sprinters have agreed to run in the Hamilton

Indoor Games next month
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#71:2:A> That includes Montreal's Bruny Surin
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#72:2:A> That starts January twelfth
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#73:2:A> The meet uh in Montreal will be uh on the nineteenth of January

</I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#74:3:A> Well it's supposed to be the end of the rush hour but it doesn't

look that way from the uhh problems that we have
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#75:3:A> D&eacute;carie southbound a stall in the lefthand lane at

Jean-Talon
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#76:3:A> Metropolitan westbound a couple of stalled vehicles there as well
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#77:3:A> Left hand lane just before D&eacute;carie Circle
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#78:3:A> And another one also left lane just before Veuillot
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#79:3:A> and the Met westbound is pretty much bumper to bumper all the way

from the Anjou interchange to D&eacute;carie Circle
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#80:3:A> Highway Twenty westbound that accident was cleared away and it is

uhh working much better than it was before so you should have less trouble

getting out to the airport
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#81:3:A> Uh the Mercier bridge we have an accident just reported on the span

there
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#82:3:A> So uh not uh not a good end to the rush hour
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#83:3:A> The Champlain though has cleared out fairly nicely
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#84:3:A> Cost you about ten minutes there
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#85:3:A> Same thing for the Victoria
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#86:3:A> Though coming off the Victoria bridge you will find things slow if

you decide to <,> get on the Bonaventure because we have the uh Sun Youth

doing a collection of donations along with the M U C Police at the corner of

Saint-Antoine and University
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#87:3:A> And that is backing things on to the Bonaventure
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#88:3:A> And one last look at Thirteen southbound and yes they did arrest a

motorist there for driving with a dummy in the passanger seat
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#89:3:A> And you would think thousands of people would get arrested if that

were the case and they did it everyday
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#90:3:A> But you're not supposed to do that in the reserved lane on the

Thirteen southbound
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#91:3:A> You have to have a real person in the passenger seat and you have

to be at least two people in your car </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#92:4:A> It's three minutes now before nine and ah once again forecast high

today probably <,> minus two
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#93:4:A> Should see quite a bit of sunshine in the course of the day
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#94:4:A> Overnight tonight it's <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}>

get cold down to minus fifteen
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#95:4:A> Lots of sunshine for tomorrow but cool temperatures
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#96:4:A> Minus eight the forecast high for tomorrow
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#97:4:A> Some snow on the way for Saturday
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#98:4:A> Not clear yet how much <,> at this point
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#99:4:A> It looks like not very much
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#100:4:A> That could change
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#101:4:A> Keep listening
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#102:4:A> And for Sunday <,,> a mixture of sun and cloud with a high around

minus three
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#103:4:A> Let's listen to a little more of Danielle Martineau in a style

we'd be maybe more expecting from her <O> Song </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#104:4:A> You're listening to Daybreak on C B C nine forty in Montreal
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#105:4:A> good morning I'm <@> Johnny Gore </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#106:4:A> Thanks for joining us this morning
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#107:4:A> Cool out there
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#108:4:A> Minus seven
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#109:4:A> The skies <,> are quite clear though
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#110:4:A> At least
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#111:4:A> Throughout the day we'll be expecting a mixture of sun and cloud

this Thursday the seventh of December <O> intro music </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#112:4:A> Skies clearing out overnight <,,> tonight completely
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#113:4:A> Temperatures dropping down as low as minus fifteen
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#114:4:A> We're ah heading towards a cold and sunny day tomorrow
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#115:4:A> Sunshine with a high of only minus eight
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#116:4:A> We're expecting a <}> <-> high of </-> <=> it could get up </=>

</}> to minus two for midtown Montreal
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#117:4:A> Uh but generally minus five that kind of thing
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#118:4:A> So it's not going to be a great great day
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#119:4:A> Uhh for the weekend and of course the weekend is in the forecast

at this point we're talking about a little bit of snow for Saturday
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#120:4:A> At this point they're saying at least five centimeters
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#121:4:A> Maybe more depending <}> <-> on </-> <=> on </=> </}> how the

system develops
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#122:4:A> But we should see a bit of sunshine on Sunday
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#123:4:A> Variable cloudiness for Sunday
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#124:4:A> Uhh highs around minus three minus four for the weekend
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#125:4:A> Fourteen minutes now after seven
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#126:4:A> And let's go out into traffic right away with <@> Peter Larue </@>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#127:5:A> Two major events there right now
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#128:5:A> Uh first of all I'm presently at the intersection of ah University

and ah Saint-Antoine
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#129:5:A> Ah today and all day the M U C Police <&> Montreal city police

</&> uh are ah doing <}> <-> a </-> <=> <}> <-> <.> l </.> </-> <+> <indig>

le </indig> </+> </}> </=> </}> special collect to the benefit of ah Sun

Youth ah
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#130:5:A> They were here ah trying to ah collect ah with all their <,>

flashers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#131:5:A> Trying to be ah very ah visible
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#132:5:A> But minutes ago <}> <-> a </-> <=> an </=> </}> unfortunate

accident happen <&> not " happened" </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#133:5:A> A pedestrian was hit ah by a car
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#134:5:A> The ambulance right in front of me
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#135:5:A> And they're about to ah clear up the sector
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#136:5:A> But it's a real bad start ah for <}> <-> that ah </-> <=> that

</=> </}> operation uhh here
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#137:5:A> So if you're in the Bonaventure expressway beware of some ah delay
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#138:5:A> But within minutes uh they should clear the sector
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#139:5:A> Secondly <,> on the Highway Thirteen <,> real bad start this

morning
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#140:5:A> We have now a second accident
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#141:5:A> Thirteen south just before the Highway Four Forty
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#142:5:A> This morning police uh uh <unclear> <?> word </?> </unclear> Metro

detachment in conjunction with uh Saint-Eustace are blitzing
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#143:5:A> So beware of a ticket operation uh they're not changing their plan

as of right now
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#144:5:A> And on Highway Thirteen ah once again it's a real bad start and

it's going to be a real bad day </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#145:6:A> We heard last hour incidently for those of you who may be facing

uhh Thirteen this morning that ah the Ministry of Transport is on the scene

<quote> evaluating </quote> they say
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#146:6:A> They are going to be reviewing their decision to have that

reserved lane <,,> on the Thirteen
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#147:6:A> Uh as soon as they gather some data today
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#148:6:A> Could have a decision by the end of the week
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#149:6:A> A spokesperson from the Ministry of Transport told us this morning

that ah they might roll back that decision to have that reserve lane
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#150:6:A> So I guess we'll have to wait til the end of the week on that one
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#151:6:A> Fifteen minutes now after seven
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#152:6:A> Incidently the chief of the M U C police <@> Jacques Babineau </@>

will be joining us this morning
<ICE-CAN:S2B-007#153:6:A> That's right after the news at seven thirty </I>
