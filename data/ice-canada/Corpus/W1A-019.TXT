<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#1:1> <h> Rachna Mara - " Of Customs and Excise" </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-019#2:1> The relationship between Dr. Naigar and Dr. Bridget is depicted in

this quotation.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#3:1> Dr. Naigar obviously somewhat resents Dr. Bridget's treatment by the

locals in India as superior.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#4:1> However, Dr. Naigar also realizes that Dr. Bridget's lack of

understanding of Indian customs can impede her judgment adversely affect her

practice of medicine.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#5:1> Dr. Bridget's training of modern medicine is <del> <.> ef </.> </del>

ineffective without proper supplies of medicine and equipment, whereas Dr.

Naigar's <del> <.> co </.> </del> use of a combination of modern medicine and

<del> <.> traditionalis </.> </del> traditional treatments proves to be much

more effective.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#6:1> The <del> attempts </del> attempt to reconcile various forms of

traditionalism and modernism <del> are </del> by each of the characters in

Rachna Mara's <ul> Of Customs and Excise </ul> is a major theme of the story.

<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#7:1> <h> Henry Lawson - " The Drover's Wife" </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-019#8:1> Henry Lawson's <del> " The <.> Dr </.> poem </del> short story "

The Drover's Wife", is one version of the story of the Drover's wife.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#9:1> In his version, the drover has gone off <del> with </del> to tend to

his sheep for six to eighteen months at a time, leaving behind his wife and

children to look after themselves.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#10:1> Lawson depicts the drover's wife as a very strong and independent

woman who is quite capable of taking care of herself and her children despite

the absence of her husband.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#11:1> She faces many hardships such as floods, wild animals, snakes and men

who might harm them, but there are very few, such as the fire, that might

have destroyed her without the help of others.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#12:1> This " Drover's wife" is a woman that is happy to be close to nature

while caring for her children.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#13:1> She is a survivor, despite the obstacles she faces daily, and she is

a character deserving of respect and admiration. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#14:1> <h> Patrick White - " A Fringe of Leaves" </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-019#15:1> The quotation from Patrick White's novel, <ul> A Fringe of Leaves

</ul> , is used to draw attention to Ellen and her position as a woman.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#16:1> <del> Though in </del> In the beginning, Ellen may cling to her

husband, Mr. Roxburgh, like moss to a rock <del> but after but after she is

unfaithful </del> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#17:1> However, after she is unfaithful to him, Ellen begins to change.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#18:1> It becomes apparent that her husband seems to be the <quote> moss

</quote> that clings to her, as she looks after his every need.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#19:1> After he dies, Ellen essentially has no <quote> tree </quote> or

<quote> rock </quote> to cling to, yet she survives.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#20:1> She adapts to her new environment and is accepting and enduring of

all that she encounters, from brutal treatment to death and cannibalism.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#21:1> Ellen is indicative of an independent woman, and even though she

relies on the convict for returning her to civilization, she survives without

him too.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#22:1> Throughout her entire ordeal, she retains her femininity, despite her

strength and independence. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#23:1> <h> Randolph Stow - <ul> Visitants </ul> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-019#24:1> The quotation, taken from Randolph Stow's novel, <del> Ni </del>

<ul> Visitants </ul> , is spoken by Dalwood after Cawdor's suicide.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#25:1> Dalwood has watched Cawdor's relationship with the New Guinea natives

slowly destroy him, as Cawdor became too involved in their lives.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#26:1> Cawdor's involvement in tribal politics and interpersonal relations

within them, though part of his job, became too much for him, so that he

destroyed his relationship with one tribe while seeking information, and

exacerbated the problems in another.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#27:1> Therefore, after his suicide, Dalwood vows to not become so

personally involved, but to simply do his job as best he can.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#28:1> He wants to keep a certain distance between himself and the natives,

especially after his brief but confusing affair with Saliba.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#29:1> He has decided that he must make his presence known to be effective,

<quote> like a wooden figurehead </quote> , and to communicate well with

Benoni, the new chief, to do his job well. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#30:1> <h> " Close-Up" </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-019#31:1> Heather McPherson's poem " Close-Up" is a depiction of the

struggle for women to enter the <del> literary <.> move </.> </del> art world

in the 1940's, especially in New Zealand.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#32:1> The woman is <del> in </del> wearing an enormous sunhat, because it

is preferred that she remain as light-coloured as possible, both in a

physical sense and in the content of her <del> writings </del> art.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#33:1> She scrapes at the hillside, because she must deal with nature, as

the winding string road separates her from the 'civilized' world.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#34:1> She is unprotected from the storm mass which creeps up on her.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#35:1> As she <quote> tussles </quote> and <quote> tugs at the earth

</quote> , she is struggling to overcome the obstacles and be an artist.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#36:1> The <quote> white hairy roots </quote> that <quote> lie crumpled at

her feet </quote> could refer to her white European background that has no

interest in the art of a colonial woman from New Zealand.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#37:1> Conversely, it could refer to the difficulty of a minority <del>

writer </del> artist to break through the predominantly white art world at

that time.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#38:1> As she cuts her hands on the tussock that threatens to both entangle

her and keep her in isolation, she <del> clears a </del> struggles to clear a

space to paint on, or a place and avenue for her to express herself.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#39:1> The title " Close-Up" suggests a first-hand viewpoint of a woman

struggling to express her art, or a picture of a single person seen from a

very short distance, but that is usually indicative of a great number of

people or a certain point of time ( e.g. The Mona Lisa). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-019#40:1> The idea of the impression of the unknowability of others seems

to be a common theme in much Commonwealth literature.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#41:1> For example, the character of Vasu in Narayan's <ul> The Man-Eater of

Malgudi </ul> , Dr. Bridget's maid in Rachna Mara's <ul> Of Customs and

Excise </ul> , and Ellen Roxborough in Patrick White's <ul> A Fringe of

Leaves </ul> , all have a certain degree of unknowability to others.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#42:1> The impression of unknowability is created by each <del> of </del>

author in a different way, for different reasons, and has a different effect

for the reader. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-019#43:1> The evil character of Vasu in Narayan's <ul> The Man-Eater of

Malgudi </ul> , has a large degree of unknowability because the reader knows

only as much as the narrator shares through the experiences of Nataraj.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#44:1> The reader is forced to assume some of Vasu's motives and reasons for

his actions, which Nataraj often fails to see for himself.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#45:1> This device forces the reader to want to interact with the novel, and

to prompt Nartaraj into taking direct action against Vasu.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#46:1> However, the more passive and seemingly ignorant Nataraj is, the more

the reader is drawn into Narayan's ploy.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#47:1> The reason Narayan withholds so much <del> of Vasu's </del>

information about Vasu is to force this reaction from the reader, and cause

readers to become frustrated and expectant of Nataraj's inevitable triumph

over Vasu.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#48:1> This creates an irony, because it not only confirms the readers

suspicions about Vasu's evil motives <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear>

</del> , and Nataraj's tendency to be too trusting of others, but provides

the major theme of the book, which is passivity versus direct action in the

resolution of conflicts.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#49:1> As it becomes apparent that Nataraj is powerless against Vasu's

cunning, guns, and use of the law, readers can empathize with his situation

and lack of action somewhat.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#50:1> However, when Vasu <del> kills </del> accidentally kills himself

during his attempt to kill the elephant, Narayan manages to convey his theme

of non-intervention and non-violence.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#51:1> This seems to incorporate Narayan's social, political and religious

philosophy, that there is no need for direct action and violence because

everything is pre-determined and will turn out for the best.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#52:1> In this case, the impression of unknowability <del> of </del> about

Vasu extends from the use of narrator to express a prominent them. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-019#53:1> In Rachna Mara's <ul> Of Customs and Excise </ul> , there is a

great degree of unknowability between Dr. Bridget and her maid.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#54:1> By using free indirect discourse, we get an impression of both

characters from the <w> others' </w> point of view, as each narrates.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#55:1> For example, Dr. Bridget believes she is adapting as best as she can,

especially when it comes to <del> sanitary </del> washroom customs.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#56:1> She has a basically western washroom set up, despite the lack of

running water.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#57:1> However, from her maid's point of view, she is appalled by Dr.

Bridget's toileting habits.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#58:1> She cannot believe that she uses toilet paper, rather that water, and

that she does not know which hand to eat with and which hand is used to

cleanse the body.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#59:1> The constant unknowing of each other's motives functions to create

suspicion between them, to later be reconciled.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#60:1> It also functions to expose the underlying cause of their suspicions,

mainly being language and custom differences which they do not understand

about each other. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-019#61:1> This device used by Mara creates irony as <del> we </del> readers

see both sides to the same story or event.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#62:1> This allows the reader to understand that neither character is wrong,

but simply has a different perspective.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#63:1> Therefore, most of the problems they have are due to a lack of

communication and / or understanding.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#64:1> By making this apparent to the reader, Mara exposes this as a major

factor in racism, and therefore may undermine it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-019#65:1> The unknowingness between Ellen and Austin Roxburgh in Patrick

White's <ul> A Fringe of Leaves </ul> is conveyed through their general lack

of communication, and through their treatment of each other.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#66:1> Ellen treats Austin as though she were merely his nurse, and he

treats her in much the same way.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#67:1> He has no idea she has been unfaithful to him with his brother, yet

senses that something is wrong.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#68:1> By comparing Ellen's and Austin's vantage points, the reader

understands the type of relationship they have, and how little they

understand of each other.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#69:1> It is ironic that the reader knows why he is anguished, and feels

pity for him, as he is sickly and seems to live only vicariously through

books.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#70:1> This functions to compare their versions, as hers is written very

much from a woman's perspective and his from a man's.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#71:1> Later, however, the change in Ellen as she is shipwrecked and living

with an island tribe, shows a marked change in her.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#72:1> For once, she doesn't subserve her own needs to the needs of Austin

or to be proper.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#73:1> Through it, a growth is evident in Ellen. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-019#74:1> The device of unknowability of certain characters is employed by

some authors in Commonwealth literature.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#75:1> <del> <.> O </.> </del> It is employed in different ways, whether by

withholding information, or by contrasting narrators <del> or </del> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#76:1> It is used for different reasons, such as to lead the reader to a new

perspective, <del> to such as by Narayan, to </del> such as passivity versus

direct action in resolving conflicts, to undermine racism with understanding

and communication, or to see the progression of a character. </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-019#77:2> In <ul> Of Customs and Excise </ul> by Mara, <del> in </del> and

Manfield's " At the Bay", women are portrayed differently from men as living

in a world of children, relationships and domestic tasks.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#78:2> More specifically, the <?> portrayal </?> of Parvati, <del> as well

as </del> Asha, Linda, Beryl, and Alice show women who are at the mercy of

their never-changing place in society. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-019#79:2> <del> Parvatie </del> Parvati, in Mara's work, <del> is depicted

</del> named after the Hindu goddess of <del> fertility </del> motherhood is

shown as the perfect mother who is also trapped because she was pregnant

before marriage.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#80:2> This unfortunate event limited her options within her society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#81:2> She needed to be married immediately so as to cover up the shame

<del> of </del> that would be put upon her. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-019#82:2> Parvati devotes herself, through prayer to <del> <.> Vi </.>

</del> the Hindu god Vishnu to <quote> do her duty </quote> - be loyal and

obedient to her husband Mohan - in exchange for preserving her own life as

well as her baby.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#83:2> Parvati <del> show </del> finds the strength to accept her fate in

society through prayer ( faith) and her love for her daughter Malla.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#84:2> She is able, through dedication, to please her husband through her

traditional cooking, <del> by </del> by bearing him children and through her

loyalty and obedience shown to Mohan's mother, Mrs. Ungoli with cleaning and

sewing.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#85:2> This apparently was expected of daughters-in-law. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-019#86:2> Parvati's acceptance of her role in society as a " home-maker"

contrasts Linda in " At the Bay" who appears <quote> unnatural </quote> in

her feelings as a mother and does not comply with what is expected of her as

a woman. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-019#87:2> Linda is feeling trapped by motherhood <del> and </del> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#88:2> She even goes as far as to push Stanley, her husband away so as she

will not become pregnant again.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#89:2> She is a married woman who is reluctant to carry out her <del> duty

</del> duties because they do not come easily to her.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-019#90:2> She does not have a choice in being pregnant or not because there are

no forms of birth control. <O> end of paragraph </O> . </p> </I>
