<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#2:1> <h> Moscow Diary </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#3:1> <h> <it> Monday Afternoon in Gorky Park </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#4:1> I walked across Krimsky Bridge and entered Gorky Park through a

colon <l> nade.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#5:1> Inside the park, I no longer heard the noise of the traffic on the

bridge.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#6:1> Before me lay a deserted square where, perhaps, summer concerts were

held, and on the other side of the square an avenue led away through bare

poplars.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#7:1> A grey Ferris wheel, empty and still, loomed above the poplars. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#8:1> I met nobody on the avenue.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#9:1> It was already mid-afternoon, and dusk would soon fall.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#10:1> The air was raw, and leaves underfoot damp and skiddy.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#11:1> After a few hundred yards, the avenue opened onto a small lake, and I

followed the path round the edge of the lake.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#12:1> A notice board beside the path advertised paddle boats for hire, but

the boats were moored to a jetty and only one drifted across the lake,

pedalled by two children. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#13:1> A man, middle-aged, and a younger woman sat on a bench near the

jetty.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#14:1> Both wore black fur hats.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#15:1> The man smoked a Herzegovina Flor.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#16:1> He had pinched the hollow mouthpiece of the cigarette between his

fingers.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#17:1> The woman spoke, looking not at the man but at her feet.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#18:1> She traced circles on the ground with the points of red leather

boots.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#19:1> " But after I married," she said as I drew nearer, " I was more

lonely than I had ever been when I lived alone.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#20:1> It was always &dotted-line;"
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#21:1> She broke off as I passed and glanced up at me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#22:1> Her hair was very fair against the black hat. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#23:1> The children's boat had drifted closer, and one child laughed and

called out to the woman, then threw a handful of pebbles into the water.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#24:1> The woman smiled and waved back.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#25:1> I walked a little fur <l> ther along the path.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#26:1> I wanted to photograph the reflection of the fading November light on

the lake, but the woman's words had upset my thoughts like a stone thrown

into water.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#27:1> I had always lived alone, and although I knew that solitude did not

always bring lone <l> liness, I had assumed, na&iuml;vely, that marriage

always ended it. </p> <O> photograph </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#28:1> I looked back at the woman on the bench and wondered whether she

had expected marriage to end her own loneliness.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#29:1> Had she hidden her disappointment?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#30:1> If the two children on the boat were hers, had they added to her

loneliness or had they helped her to bear it?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#31:1> Had the marriage ended?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#32:1> And the man on the bench, her impassive listener: friend? second

husband?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#33:1> Would the woman even want to marry again? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#34:1> Cold had made my fingers clumsy.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#35:1> I took only one photograph of the lake.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#36:1> While I walked back through the park, I turned over and over my

discovery that there is loneliness in Moscow and in mar <l> riage.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#37:1> By the time I reached Krimsky Bridge, dusk had fallen. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#38:1> <h> <it> Tuesday Evening at a Tram Stop Near Ismailovsky Park </it>

</h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#39:1> For an hour I had wandered through quiet streets in eastern

Moscow.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#40:1> I wanted to escape from the loneliness of an empty apart <l> ment,

but by nightfall the cold had grown unbearable and now, as I walked back to

the tram stop, it pierced my coat and stung me. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#41:1> The tram stop was on a street that ran past the southern end of

Ismailovsky Park.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#42:1> At that hour there was little traffic, and apart from two militia

men, shoulders hunched against the cold, nobody passed me on foot.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#43:1> The park lay behind snow-covered pines and birches.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#44:1> If I turned my face into the wind blowing through the trees, my eyes

watered and the tears froze my lashes together. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#45:1> I was too cold to stand still when I reached the tram stop, so I

paced.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#46:1> The packed snow squeaked under my heels.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#47:1> I turned.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#48:1> Two other people now stood at the stop, just on the edge of the

street lamp's dim light.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#49:1> I wondered where they had come from.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#50:1> There were no cinemas or restaurants nearby, only the park, where

nobody walked at night.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#51:1> When I came closer I saw that it was a woman and a man, both in their

thirties.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#52:1> The woman had clasped her arms about herself and was stamping her

boots in the snow.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#53:1> The man, hands in the pockets of his long overcoat, was looking over

the woman's shoulder in the direction from which the tram would approach.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#54:1> He and the woman spoke quietly together with <l> out looking at each

other.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#55:1> I saw their breath but could not hear their words. </p> <O>

photograph </O> <O> caption </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#56:1> Several moments passed.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#57:1> The couple fell silent, and I paced again.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#58:1> The lights of the tram soon appeared.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#59:1> I hurried back to the stop.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#60:1> The couple did not move.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#61:1> The tram drew up, and I stood with one foot on the ground and one on

the step so that it could not leave.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#62:1> Still the couple did nothing.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#63:1> Suddenly, the woman bent for <l> wards a little and raised the man's

gloved hand to her lips.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#64:1> He smiled, a quick half-smile of pleasure, then kissed the crown of

the woman's white fur hat and stepped onto the tram.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#65:1> The doors clat <l> tered shut behind us.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#66:1> As the tram moved forwards from the stop, I pressed my face to the

window.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#67:1> The woman was walking away down the street.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#68:1> So, I thought, recognizing something comforting in this sight, lovers

in Moscow don't look back either when they leave each other. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#69:1> <h> <it> Wednesday Afternoon in Sheremetev Palace </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#70:1> This week, for the first time, Kostya was late.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#71:1> Zina drew her green parka tightly about her and sat down to wait on

the stone steps outside the entrance hall. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#72:1> On Wednesday afternoons Kostya gave no lectures, and Zina saw no

patients, so every week they met in Sheremetev Palace.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#73:1> Few buses travelled from the centre of Moscow to the eastern

outskirts.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#74:1> They were often the only visitors in the palace.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#75:1> In the first months they had walked along avenues of lindens, or

withdrawn to cool <l> ness and shade in the summer house.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#76:1> Now they met in the entrance hall of the palace, where their voices

echoed, though they always spoke quietly. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#77:1> In the hall they handed in their tickets and received enormous

felt slippers to protect the parquet from their winter boots.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#78:1> They sat on a marble bench to lace up the slippers.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#79:1> Every week Zina murmured " I really ought to tie my slippers myself,"

and some <l> times she even reached down to do so, but Kostya always

insisted.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#80:1> This touched her, and it pleased her to see his dark head bent over

her lap. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#81:1> From the hall they padded through salons and bed chambers and

music rooms, each opening into the next, until they reached the ballroom.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#82:1> After the first few weeks, the guide in the entrance hall stopped

even looking up from his newspaper when they passed his chair. </p> <O>

photograph </O> <O> caption </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#83:1> Low winter sun lit the ballroom.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#84:1> Tall mirrors and white bas-reliefs covered three walls; on the

fourth, windows rose to the ceiling.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#85:1> The only furniture was a set of silkwood chairs which stood against

one wall, between the mirrors.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#86:1> A row of chandeliers hung along the middle of the ballroom.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#87:1> For an hour or two, Kostya and Zina sat in a window seat in the far

corner.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#88:1> They talked together with pleasure and relief of names hardly

recognized at home: Bondarev and Bunin, Glazunov and Scriabin.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#89:1> Once, Zina spoke of her former husband's unsettling visits to her

daughter.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#90:1> Occasionally, hesitantly, they spoke of themselves.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#91:1> But often they were silent, at ease with each other.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#92:1> During these silences Zina thought of all their Wednesdays and asked

herself, " do I deserve so much pleasure?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#93:1> How long can it last?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#94:1> There had been one unhappy afternoon.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#95:1> Towards the end of September, they had borrowed her sister's two-room

apartment for a few hours instead of coming to Sheremetev Palace.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#96:1> But the brown flock wallpaper, the smell of boiled cabbage, and the

sound of a child crying next door had snuffed out Zina's desire.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#97:1> " I can't," she said simply.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#98:1> And again: " I just can't."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#99:1> " It doesn't matter," said Kostya over and over, kissing her fingers.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#100:1> " It doesn't matter.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#101:1> Another time.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#102:1> Another time."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#103:1> But Zina had looked away, fighting tears of frustration and

disappointment. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#104:1> Why was he late today?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#105:1> With the heel of her boot, Zina chipped splinters of ice off the

step below her.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#106:1> They had so little time together.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#107:1> If he had missed the bus, he would not be here for almost two hours.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#108:1> Two hours lost.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#109:1> Perhaps he was ill.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#110:1> Or perhaps his son was ill, and his wife had stayed home from the

office.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#111:1> Even if there had been a telephone in the entrance hall, Zina could

not risk call <l> ing.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#112:1> She would simply have to wait. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#113:1> From the window seat she would be able to watch the avenue that

led from the main gate to the palace.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#114:1> She pushed open the heavy door of the entrance hall and handed in

her ticket.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#115:1> For the first time, though without pleasure, she laced up the felt

slippers her <l> self. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#116:1> Today the ballroom was much colder.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#117:1> Grey sky and grey ice stretched away from the window seat.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#118:1> Daylight had begun to fade.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#119:1> Nobody walked along the avenue from the gate. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#120:1> She looked away from the window.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#121:1> Around her, a dozen mirrors in giltwood frames reflected her breath.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#122:1> Far across the room, one mirror reflected the door, half closed, of

a small bed chamber.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#123:1> Zina thought of the brown flock wallpaper and wondered, " might we

try again? <O> photograph </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#124:1> Would that be the right thing to do?"
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#125:1> Perhaps she should ask Kostya this afternoon, before she lost her

nerve.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#126:1> Yes, she would ask.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#127:1> As soon as he arrived.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#128:1> He might even agree.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#129:1> The boldness of this decision astonished her.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#130:1> She glanced round, forgetting for a moment that there was nobody in

the ballroom to see her confu <l> sion. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#131:1> He was now well over an hour late.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#132:1> Zina retied the knot on one of her slippers and turned once more to

the window.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#133:1> Doubt nee <l> dled her again.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#134:1> Perhaps it was better after all, she thought, to see each other only

in Sheremetev Palace.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#135:1> This way, they avoided fur <l> ther disillusionment, or at least

postponed it.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#136:1> Yet she envied women and men who were free to take chances together

and risk disillusionment.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#137:1> It would be good, very good, to have that freedom with Kostya.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#138:1> The shock of discovering that she had become a man's other woman had

been painful; the lack of freedom to take a chance outside with that man was

even more painful. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#139:1> Dusk was settling over the palace grounds.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#140:1> Zina cupped her hands round her eyes.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#141:1> A figure in a long coat now walked on the avenue, but she could not

tell whether it was Kostya.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#142:1> She slid down from the window seat.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#143:1> Quickly, as quickly as the slippers allowed, she retraced her steps

through the ballroom, the music room, the salon, to the entrance hall.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#144:1> But when she reached the door, she stopped.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#145:1> " Am I doing the right thing?" she wondered again, alarmed.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#146:1> Then she thought of the window seat in the corner, the reflection in

the far mirror, and the pleasure, the pleasure.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#147:1> She pulled open the door and stepped outside to see whether the fig

<l> ure was Kostya. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#148:1> <h> <it> Friday Evening on the Arbat </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#149:1> <w> In " <foreign> Dommage quand m&ecircumflex;me </foreign> " ,

the Russian poet Boulat Okoujava writes that when he tires of this age of sci

<l> ence and light and reason, he longs for Pushkin's Moscow of ill-lit

streets and horse-drawn carriages.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#150:1> One night his longing takes him to the Arbat:
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#151:1> <quote> I cannot bring back the past.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#152:1> But still, it's a pity that I cannot dine late into the night with

Pushkin &dotted-line;.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#153:1> I cannot bring back the past.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#154:1> But I go out into the street and there, by the gates of the Arbat, I

see a fiacre waiting and Pushkin pacing up and down. <O> photograph </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#155:1> Oh surely tonight, at last, something will happen! </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#156:1> After a day spent searching for milk, I too longed for a different

Moscow.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#157:1> I turned towards the Arbat in search of Pushkin. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-012#158:1> The Arbat was one of the most fashionable streets in Moscow when

Pushkin rented a flat there early in 1831.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#159:1> He lived amongst artists and writers, wealthy bohemians who dined at

the Yar and then returned to their elegant pale blue houses to drink cham <l>

pagne and play cards until morning.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#160:1> In letters to friends, Pushkin wrote of life on the Arbat and of his

approaching marriage:
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#161:1> <quote> My marriage with Natalya ( who, parenthetically, is my

hundred and thirteenth love) is decided &dotted-line;.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#162:1> In a few days I shall visit you, and I shall bring the champagne

with pleasure.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#163:1> I met the New Year with the gyp <l> sies and with Tanyusha, my

genuine drunken Tatiana, who sang a song made up in the gypsy camp

&dotted-line;.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#164:1> I am breaking this letter off here, so as not to pass my anguish on

to you; you have enough of your own.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#165:1> Write to me on the Arbat. </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#166:1> The Arbat soon grew too expensive for Pushkin, and after six months

he and Natalya left Moscow to live in a country house near <}> <-> St </->

<+> Saint </+> </}> Petersburg. </I> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-012#X167:1> Six years later, Pushkin was killed in a duel with Natalya's lover.

</p> </X>
