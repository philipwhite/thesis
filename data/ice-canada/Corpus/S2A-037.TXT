<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#1:1> Oh it's okay you know <O> laugh </O> fifty percent off for you and

<unclear> a few words mumbled </unclear> not me
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#2:1> If you're too nice <,> you'll have problems being an entrepreneur
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#3:1> You have to have that profit motivation
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#4:1> <}> <-> You have to </-> <=> everything you do <,> is worth something

</=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#5:1> You have to have a price tag associated with it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#6:1> Otherwise you become too <,> benevolent and end up <O> laugh </O>

going out of business <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#7:1> What do you think are the key skills for entrepreneurs
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#8:1> <,> If you're <unclear> about three words </unclear> what would you

say would be the key skill for an entrepreneur <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#9:1> The number one <,> above all <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#10:1> Give it a shot
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#11:1> Mh hmm

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#12:1:Z> <O> answer </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#13:1:A> Motivation sure
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#14:1:A> Passion or desire
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#15:1:A> Ya no definitely I mean <}> <-> that </-> <=> that's </=> </}> way

above <,> anything else
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#16:1:A> Just <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> sheer desire will carry you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#17:1:A> In other words if you aren't <,> driven <,,> then <,> you might as

well

<$ZA> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#18:1:Z> <O> comment </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#19:1:A> Perserverance determination willing to stick to it over all

the obstacles and hurdles
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#20:1:A> And there'll be plenty of them
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#21:1:A> That's another <,> key trait or characteristic
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#22:1:A> In terms of skills uh like uh you know if you have a skill an

ability to do something ah a learned ah
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#23:1:A> <}> <-> That's </-> <=> that's </=> </}> an attitude if you will
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#24:1:A> You know <}> <-> those </-> <=> those </=> </}> are attitudes <X>

<$ZB> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X25:1:Z> <O> answer </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X26:1:A> Huh

<$ZB> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X27:1:Z> <O> repeats </O> </X>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#28:1:A> Communication
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#29:1:A> Networking sure
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#30:1:A> And <}> <-> an </-> <=> an </=> </}> extension of that is <,>

selling
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#31:1:A> Cos that's what <,> selling is <,> <?> is </?> communication
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#32:1:A> And <,> basically that's been found to be the premier skill <,,>

for entrepreneurs
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#33:1:A> If you can't sell <,,> then you'll have to get somebody that can

cos nothing happens until somebody sells something
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#34:1:A> So you can have the greatest product in the world you can have the

best mousetrap you can have <,> excellent ideas <,,> but unless somebody goes

and buys them <,> you don't have a business <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#35:1:A> So number one you need sales
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#36:1:A> And so uh many ah artisian <}> <-> <.> entrepren </.> </-> <+>

entrepreneurs </+> </}> you know artisan entrepreneurs <,> who are very good

at woodworking or some type of craft <,> they have a problem <,> because they

make beautiful products <,> but they can't sell <}> <-> em </-> <+> them </+>

</}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#37:1:A> They don't have the skills of selling
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#38:1:A> So ah in sales you can see like uh Anheuser-Busch he started <}>

<-> in <.> s </.> </-> <=> in ah sales </=> </}> <,> ah selling <?> brooms

</?> <unclear> about four words </unclear> big things <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#39:1:A> Bic ah ah Marcel Bich of Bic Pens ah started his career by selling

flashlights door to door
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#40:1:A> Uh Dr Scholes <,,> uhm he was selling uh uh uh uh <unclear> word

</unclear> <?> or </?> an arch support
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#41:1:A> <unclear> a few words </unclear> <,,> be a salesman
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#42:1:A> Heinz ketchup <,> <}> <-> he had he </-> <=> he made </=> </}>

money selling his own bottled horseradish to local grocers <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#43:1:A> Mary Kay <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#44:1:A> And uh Coleman Camping Equipment <,> uh he was a travelling

typewriter salesman
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#45:1:A> So it really is the communication skills uh <?> related </?> to uh

<unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#46:1:A> And selling is very
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#47:1:A> <?> I mean </?> anybody can sell
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#48:1:A> The key is credibility and trust <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#49:1:A> You all have to have ah <}> <-> an </-> <=> ah ah an </=> </}>

enjoyment of working with people <,> and credibility and trust <,> and

basically then anybody can sell <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#50:1:A> Since we were on that track <,,> <?> I'm going to run you by </?>

some things here that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#51:1:A> <}> <-> You </-> <=> you've </=> </}> been feeling that <,> one of

the top
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#52:1:A> Perserverance remember <}> <-> you were say </-> <=> you were

saying </=> </}> that pererverance <,> or determination is a key

characteristic of somebody going into business for themselves <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#53:1:A> Let's categorize it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#54:1:A> Would you call that a skill
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#55:1:A> <}> <-> A <}> <-> <.> sk </.> </-> <+> skill </+> </}> </-> <=> a

<,> with a gift
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#58:1:A> You're born with a gift
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#59:1:A> A skill is something you can learn
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#60:1:A> And an attitude of course is a feeling or something internal <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#61:1:A> Uhm <,,> so well <}> <-> you </-> <=> you </=> </}> can start back

<,> with perserverance
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#62:1:A> How would you label perserverance <,,> <{> <[> <&> audience

<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#196:1:Z> Like an entrepreneur
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#197:1:Z> Uh <O> laugh </O> when I used to have them come in to do a class

<,> on the way to the classroom they'd find five business opportunities with

<unclear> word </unclear> <?> credit </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#198:1:Z> They'd come in and say how come nobody saw that how come nobody

saw this
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#199:1:Z> And I just stood there going ya <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#200:1:Z> Like every day you pass by must be a couple of dozen <,> business

opportunities <X>

<$ZK> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X201:1:Z> <O> question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X202:1:A> Ah well <}> <-> that's </-> <=> that's </=> </}> the next

phase </X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#203:1:A> That would be putting the <}> <-> <.> o </.> <.> o </.> </-> <=>

opportunity </=> </}> into practice
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#204:1:A> Then you have to do some research
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#205:1:A> Then you have to determine whether or not the idea is feasible
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#206:1:A> That's when you get into the research phase
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#207:1:A> You find out if there's competition <,> find out if there's a

niche <}> <-> there's a </-> <=> you know </=> </}> <,> and then make your

plan business plan in terms of how you're going to attack that niche <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#208:1:A> But to see or perceive the opportunity it is <,> a gift or a skill

cos it can be developed
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#209:1:A> So the entrepreneurs that would come into class were teaching the

students how to be sensitive <,> to business opportunities <X>

<$ZK> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X210:1:Z> <O> comment </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X211:1:A> Yes
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X212:1:A> That's part of your research

<$ZK> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X213:1:Z> <O> comment </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X214:1:A> Oh ya <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> passion the

personality and so on and so forth
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X215:1:A> Sure

<$ZK> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X216:1:Z> <O> comment </O> </X>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#217:1:A> <}> <-> Kay </-> <+> okay </+> </}> <}> <-> you're </-> <=>

you're </=> </}> moving ahead to idea
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#218:1:A> In other words you're looking for <,> <?> scanning the </?>

environment for opportunities <}> <-> to </-> <=> to </=> </}> take advantage

of it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#219:1:A> You will and then you're an entrepreneur <,,> is what you're

<unclear> word </unclear> <X>

<$ZK> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X220:1:Z> <O> response </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X221:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X222:1:A> Well <,> why is that <,,>

<$ZK> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X223:1:Z> <O> response </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X224:1:A> <unclear> word </unclear> an opportunity

<$ZK> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X225:1:Z> <O> response </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X226:1:A> <}> <-> You're </-> <=> okay okay </=> </}> </X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#227:1:A> Ya <O> laugh </O> <}> <-> <?> If </?> you're driven </-> <=> If

you're driven </=> </}> by profit alone you'll never see <}> <-> the the </->

<=> the </=> </}> viability to it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#228:1:A> The thing is that for <}> <-> <.> eve </.> </-> <+> every </+>

</}> have you ever regretted ah an opportunity that you didn't take advantage

of that ended up being very successful
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#229:1:A> <}> <-> Do you <.> s </.> </-> <=> Do you know </=> </}> what I'm

saying
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#230:1:A> Are you <X>

<$ZK> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X231:1:Z> <O> response </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#X232:1:A> Okay </X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#233:1:A> Well <}> <-> <.> dri </.> </-> <=> driving </=> </}> around <?>

like this </?> I'm getting to determine the motivations of why you want to be

in business for yourself and what you want to get out of it and so on
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#234:1:A> Cos <}> <-> that </-> <=> there </=> </}> are many different types

of entrepreneurs
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#235:1:A> Some people are threshold entrepreneurs and want to build a great

profit <,,> and others are quite happy just to make a nice living where they

have a comfortable existence take care of their family that sort of thing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#236:1:A> So <}> <-> but </-> <=> and </=> </}> it's not to say one's good

and one's bad because it's just the opportunity they're looking for
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#237:1:A> The threshold-type opportunity <}> <-> is </-> <=> is </=> </}>

more elusive than just finding something that would be good for now
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#238:1:A> But what you might want to think of doing is <,> stepping in at a

level <,,> and then just to get the experience <,,> and then you'll be

working up level by level
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#239:1:A> Just get your feet wet a bit <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#240:1:A> You know you get an opportunity it may not be extravagant or it

may not be
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#241:1:A> But don't forget if the idea is that great everybody else sees it

too
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#242:1:A> <}> <-> <.> O </.> <.> O </.> </-> <=> Oftentimes </=> </}> the

big successes come from seeing something that nobody else has seen <,> and

therefore you get an edge you get a <,> year's head-start before all of a

sudden everybody realizes woo hey there's something to this <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#243:1:A> You know that's <?> all they've got </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#244:1:A> Ray Kroc's idea
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#245:1:A> <}> <-> he he </-> <=> Not everybody opened up the same day as him

</=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#246:1:A> Ah you know it was years later
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#247:1:A> In fact his key employee <,> naturally <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#248:1:A> The best employee that McDonald's ever had
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#249:1:A> Won employee of the month <,,> all the <?> time </?> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#250:1:A> Always <?> perfect </?> on all his performance appraisals

excellent employee comes in on his days off <,,> without pay to learn the

business
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#251:1:A> What a super employee
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#252:1:A> That's the guy who started Burger King <&> audience laughs </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-037#253:1:A> But I mean you <}> <-> gotta </-> <+> have got to </+> </}>

expect that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#254:1:A> If the idea is that good people are going to flock into it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-037#255:1:A> <}> <-> And </-> <=> and </=> </}> <}> <-> even </-> <=> you might

</=> </}> get a head start if you're lucky but you better have the money to

pour into that too because they'll just eat cash </I>
