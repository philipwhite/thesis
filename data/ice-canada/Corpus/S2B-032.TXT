<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-032#1:1:A> Since nineteen seventy worldwide bicycle production has soared

from twenty-three million to one hundred eleven million per year
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#2:1:A> Today three times more bicycles than cars are produced each year
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#3:1:A> According to the Worldwatch Institute that's a good sign of

sustainability
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#4:1:A> Not only do bicycles avoid nearly all of the greenhouse effect

causing of cars they don't require nearly as many roads that eat up valuable

croplands
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#5:1:A> This is especially important in Asia where half of the world's

population is supported by only one third of the world's cropland
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#6:1:A> According to Worldwatch Institute growing interest in the car has

already caused Bangkok Thailand to pave over most of its famous canals with

roads to reduce traffic congestion
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#7:1:A> About six hundred new cars are added to the streets of Bangkok every

day
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#8:1:A> Now that's the equivalent of three kilometres of bumper to bumper

traffic
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#9:1:A> At this rate it will only take four years or so to fill the entire

road system with one solid lane of traffic
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#10:1:A> Worldwatch says this rate is unsustainable in physical terms that

any tourist can see

<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#14:2:A> He's a consultant to a major community project on Vancouver Island
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#15:2:A> And he's a futurist
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#16:2:A> But most of all <@> Ray Dancing </@> has a knack for facing down

some of the world's most challenging problems with spirit and enthusiasm
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#17:2:A> Today as we continue our conversation <@> Dancing </@> predicts an

ensuing food crisis will send guerrilla gardeners into the streets in search

of golf courses and boulevards in which to plant food
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#18:2:A> We'll also ask <@> Ray Dancing </@> why he thinks gross national

product is a poor indicator of sustainable development <&> music, 20 seconds

</&>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#19:2:A> According to the Worldwatch Institute the nineteen ninety-five

grain harvest <}> <-> was a </-> <=> was the </=> </}> smallest in seven

years
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#20:2:A> In fact food production is fifteen percent below its historic peak

of three hundred and forty-six kilograms per person in nineteen eighty-four
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#21:2:A> When you juxtapose declining food production with the world's

population which is increasing at a rate of ninety million per year you begin

to see the potential for serious problems
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#22:2:A> We spoke to <@> Ray Dancing </@> at the Striking a Balance

Conference held recently in Edmonton
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#23:2:A> I asked him what implications increasing population and the

greenhouse effect pose for food production

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-032#25:2:A> Farm prices are already going up in Alberta and grain prices

are also on the rise
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#26:2:A> As if rising prices and growing population wasn't enough to deal

with questions are also beginning to surface about diminishing returns from

the use of technologies like pesticides and herbicides

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-032#28:2:A> If there's one repeating theme we've heard in our series about

sustainable development it's a trend towards schemes that are more

ecologically inspired
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#29:2:A> <@> Waylon Riggs </@> told us managing his ranch was far easier and

smarter in an economic sense if he worked with instead of fighting nature
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#30:2:A> Foresters told us in our series on sustainable forestry that

ecosystem management is a scheme that will not only grow good trees it'll

also help preserve bio and genetic diversity as well
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#31:2:A> And this is at the heart of <@> Dancing's </@> vision of a

sustainable future
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#32:2:A> It's not enough to simply talk about integrating environment

economy and social needs you have to do it
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#33:2:A> For a long time gross national product and economic growth have

been principle indicators of economic progress in the Western world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#34:2:A> <@> Dancing </@> thinks the time has come to question growth and

the G N P as key measures of progress

one of the original promises of technology more leisure time
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#37:2:A> That would certainly be a contrast to what we've seen so far higher

stress levels very little job security and high unemployment
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#38:2:A> <@> Ray Dancing </@> also has a theory about shopping malls
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#39:2:A> He thinks they'll soon become a thing of the past
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#40:2:A> He says the return of the neighbourhood store and the growth of

Internet shopping will be the driving forces behind the death of malls
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#41:2:A> He predicts shopping malls <}> <-> will be </-> <=> will respond

villages complete with homes shops and a neighbourhood square

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-032#47:3:A> That twenty year-old lawnmower may belch out black smoke every

time you start it but hey it still runs
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#48:3:A> And that's precisely the problem says <@> Boris Yechokovsky </@>

with Environment Canada's Mobile Emissions Division
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#49:3:A> Lawnmowers snow blowers and other small engines can be hazardous to

your health <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#50:3:A> Using your lawnmower for an hour belches out the same amount of

pollution as driving your car for six hundred fifty kilometres
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#51:3:A> <@> Yechokovsky </@> says Environment Canada is investigating two

possible solutions
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#52:3:A> The first is a catalytic converter that would sell for around ten

dollars and could reduce emissions by up to fifty percent
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#53:3:A> The second solution being investigated is alternative fuels that

could reduce carbon monoxide pollution by as much as sixty percent
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#54:3:A> Part of the problem is we all use these small engines at the same

time <,> and since carbon monoxide is about the same density as air it just

hangs around poisoning you as you do your lawn
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#55:3:A> Fuel spillage is also a problem as hydrocarbons are rapidly

released into the air whenever you miss the tank <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#56:3:A> The State of California already has plans to force manufacturers to

cut emissions by two-thirds by the year nineteen ninety-nine
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#57:3:A> But you could do your part today by keeping your engine tuned or by

borrowing a neighbour's push lawnmower <,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-032#60:4:A> <@> Danny Dressel </@> is one of Alberta's best known

naturalists
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#61:4:A> He once said <quote> man's improving on nature is indeed very close

to impossible </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#62:4:A> He also said <quote> the protection of wilderness is more than just

an aesthetic it's absolutely necessary </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#63:4:A> In fact most Albertans agree with <@> Danny Dressel </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#64:4:A> The United Nations Brundtland Commission on Environment and Economy

reported in nineteen eighty-seven that protected areas need to be at least

tripled to constitute a representative sample of the Earth's ecosystems
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#65:4:A> The commission also indicated that saving species in their

ecosystems is an indispensable prerequisite for sustainable development
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#66:4:A> When Alberta wrote its own sustainable development plan the

completion of a system of protected areas was front and centre
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#67:4:A> Today we begin a series of programs that will examine how Alberta

is doing at protecting natural ecosystems <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#68:4:A> <@> Alan Van Dusen </@> <?> was </?> a naturalist an Albertan with

to protect vanishing ecosystems </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-032#77:5:A> There's been a long and distinguished history of creating

parks and wilderness areas in Alberta
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#78:5:A> It began in eighteen eighty-five with the establishment of Banff

Canada's first national park
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#79:5:A> Since then Waterton Lakes Jasper Elk Island and Wood Buffalo

National Parks have been created
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#80:5:A> At almost forty-five thousand square kilometres Wood Buffalo is the

largest national park in the western hemisphere
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#81:5:A> But according to the Alberta government reports most of Alberta's

diverse ecosystems are still unprotected and in some cases vanishing
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#82:5:A> Today we present part two in our series on protecting Alberta's

endangered ecosystems

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-032#83:5:Z> <O> speech, 30 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-032#84:5:A> That was <@> Elaine Sahal </@> of the Alberta Wilderness

Association
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#85:5:A> Alberta is short of protected areas
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#86:5:A> This may come as a surprise to many people who already know that

Alberta's blessed with some of the most beautiful parks in the world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#87:5:A> But most of these parks were established to protect economic

interests or national curiosities and not ecosystems per se
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#88:5:A> Alberta's a wonderfully biologically diverse province
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#89:5:A> Ecologists divide Alberta into six major natural regions the

Grasslands Aspen parkland Boreal forest Foothills Rocky Mountains and

Canadian Shield
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#90:5:A> These six natural regions are further divided into twenty natural

subregions
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#91:5:A> According to the Alberta ecologist and author <@> Alan Van Dusen

</@> the natural regions that are most endangered are the ones we live in

<$ZA> <ICE-CAN:S2B-032#92:5:Z> <O> Extra corpus speech, 3 min 10 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-032#93:5:A> The idea of protecting Alberta's ecosystems has been around in

draft government reports and policies since the late nineteen seventies and

early nineteen eighties but it wasn't until nineteen ninety-five when Ty Lund

Alberta's environment minister released the Special Places Two Thousand plan

that it became government policy to protect ecosystems
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#94:5:A> According to Doctor <@> Jay Allanson </@> of the University of

Alberta this is important because for the first time Alberta's agreed to a

scientific approach to protect ecosystems

<$ZB> <ICE-CAN:S2B-032#95:5:Z> <O> Extra corpus speech, 45 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-032#96:5:A> According to the Alberta government's nineteen ninety-five

State of the Environment report only four of Alberta's twenty natural

subregions are adequately represented
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#97:5:A> They include the Alpine Subalpine and Montane Natural Subregions in

the Rocky Mountains and the Peace River Lowlands in the Boreal forest
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#98:5:A> If the government's own assessment of its progress isn't bad enough

there's a scientific debate going on as to whether the Montane is adequately

protected
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#99:5:A> <@> Alan Van Dusen </@> explains

<$ZA> <ICE-CAN:S2B-032#100:5:Z> <O> Extra corpus speech, 25 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-032#101:5:A> <@> Van Dusen </@> says that more than five hundred and fifty

square kilometres of montane in Jasper and Banff National Parks is severely

compromised
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#102:5:A> I asked <@> Alan Van Dusen </@> what indicators tell us that

things aren't well in the Montane

<$ZA> <ICE-CAN:S2B-032#103:5:Z> <O> Extra corpus speech, 1 min 20 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-032#104:5:A> Very little comes easily in the struggle to protect Alberta's

natural regions and the options diminish with each passing day
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#105:5:A> Less than twenty percent of the original Grasslands are left and

as little as five percent of the Aspen parkland remains today
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#106:5:A> The World Wildlife Fund recently awarded Alberta a B for progress

on protecting endangered spaces
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#107:5:A> That's a major improvement over the F it received a year ago
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#108:5:A> Alberta was recognized because environment minister Ty Lund

promised to protect Alberta's ecoregions by nineteen ninety-eight and for

legally protecting Willmore Wilderness Park north of Jasper
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#109:5:A> Since the program was launched Alberta has created two new

provincial parks twenty-seven new natural areas and one new ecological

reserve
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#110:5:A> That's it for this week's feature report
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#111:5:A> Next week the Environment Minister has promised to protect

examples of all of Alberta's natural regions by nineteen ninety-eight
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#112:5:A> Can it be done
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#113:5:A> Find out on next week's program </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-032#114:6:A> Alberta has a colourful history of creating parks and

protected areas
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#115:6:A> It all began with the protection of Banff Hot Springs as a Crown

reserve in eighteen eighty-five
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#116:6:A> Two years later in eighteen eighty-seven Rocky Mountains National

Park was established <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#117:6:A> Little known to most people three national parks have been created

and abolished in Alberta's history
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#118:6:A> In nineteen oh eight Buffalo National Park was created near

Wainwright to protect bison <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#119:6:A> Wawaskesy and Nemiskam National Parks were created in nineteen

twenty-two to save the prong-horned antelope
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#120:6:A> All three were abolished by nineteen forty-seven <,> because the

antelope came back and bison were being protected elsewhere in Wood Buffalo

National Park
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#121:6:A> If these parks existed today though they would protect some of

Alberta's most endangered ecosystems <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#122:6:A> In nineteen thirty-two Alberta created its first four provincial

parks Aspen Beach Gooseberry Lake Park Lake and Saskatoon Island
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#123:6:A> Today these small parks are among the most popular recreation

sites in Alberta
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#124:6:A> That's it for this week's Ecofacts and Trends

<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-032#126:7:A> Alberta has been blessed with some of the most spectacular

landscapes you'll find anywhere
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#127:7:A> But as oil and gas agriculture forestry and cities push to the

last frontiers the province's natural ecosystems have begun to show signs of

stress
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#128:7:A> Alberta's Special Places Two Thousand program seeks to ensure

examples of those rare and beautiful natural landscapes are preserved for

future generations
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#129:7:A> But critics argue the program is so full of holes you can drive

oil rigs and logging trucks through them
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#130:7:A> Today we present part three in our series on protecting Alberta's

endangered ecosystems
<ICE-CAN:S2B-032#131:7:A> A nineteen ninety-six Environics poll found that eighty-nine

percent of Albertans were in favour of completing a national network of

protected areas even if it would result in reduced forestry and mining </I>
