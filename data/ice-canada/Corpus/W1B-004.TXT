<ICE-CAN:W1B-004#128:3> 2 days ago, we discovered, to our alarm, a HUGE spider ( nothing

new) with fangs this big, <O> drawing of fangs </O> in the bathroom.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-004#129:3> After consulting with several neighbours, we ascertained that if it

bites you, you die in either 2 days, or between 2 <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+>

it.

<ICE-CAN:W1B-004#133:3> <@> Chen </@> stomped on it, <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> we

ceremoniously flushed it away with our precious water supply.

<ICE-CAN:W1B-004#135:3> dust everywhere - impossible to keep clean) ...

<ICE-CAN:W1B-004#137:3> I, being the naïve thing I am, accepted this flawed conclusion, as

it appeased my own paranoia, to an extent.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-004#138:3> Well .. this morning, ( should we wash dishes, clothes, or bathe?

<ICE-CAN:W1B-004#178:4> Got your letter as well, <@> D. </@> , and hope to hear from <@> R.

</@> soon.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-004#179:4> I think you must have broken your life record for letter-writing

with me, <@> Ross </@> !
<ICE-CAN:W1B-004#180:4> On the book front, I'm currently addicted to PD James & Ruth

Rendell, which I've been finding at a library of sorts of the foreign

community here.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-004#181:4> My social life consists primarily of being alone.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-004#182:4> It's a quiet, non-stimulating culture - I feel rather calm, for me,

actually.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-004#183:4> Farmers here are suffering a draught. <O> end of letter </O> </p>
