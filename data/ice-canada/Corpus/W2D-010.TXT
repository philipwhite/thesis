<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-010#21:1> <bold> i) Standard Financing Plan: CREDIT CHARGES </bold> will be

imposed on purchases from the date of purchase.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#22:1> However if you pay your New Balance in full by the payment due date

shown on your monthly statement covering the prior billing period ( which is

25 days after the statement closing date), no <bold> CREDIT CHARGE </bold> is

assessed in the current billing period.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#23:1> <bold> ii) Special Financing Plans: </bold> In addition to our

standard financing plan as set forth above, from time to time we may, at our

option, offer special financing plans on purchases made under your account.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#24:1> Specific terms of purchase under a special plan will be shown

separately on your monthly statement.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#25:1> We may, at our option, transfer the unpaid balance of a purchase

under a special financing plan to our standard financing plan, any time you

fail to make any required payment when due.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#26:1> Explanations of some special plans are: <l>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-010#27:1> <bold> ( a) Deferred Payment and Interest: </bold> Your first

payment is deferred for a specified time period and no <bold> CREDIT CHARGES

</bold> are assessed during the deferral period.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#28:1> <bold> ( b) Interest Free: </bold> You will not be assessed any

<bold> CREDIT CHARGES </bold> on your purchase for a specified time period.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#29:1> However our normal rules will apply in calculating your minimum

monthly payments. <bold> ( c) Reduced Rate: </bold> A reduced <bold> ANNUAL

CREDIT RATE </bold> and special repayment terms will apply to your purchase

advance. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#30:1> <h> <bold> 6. Promise to Pay: </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-010#31:1> You agree to pay the amount billed, including insurance ( if

any), plus any credit charge applicable.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#32:1> You must pay no less than the minimum payment indicated on each

monthly billing statement calculated as explained under the <bold> " Payment"

</bold> clause. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#33:1> <h> <bold> 7. Payment: </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-010#34:1> You will pay Beneficial the amount of all sales in respect of

which the Beneficial Card has been used and any <bold> CREDIT CHARGES </bold>

and insurance ( if applicable), within twenty-five <bold> ( 25) </bold> days

from the date of each Monthly Billing Statement sent by us to you as follows:

( a) in full, in which case no further <bold> CREDIT CHARGES </bold> will be

payable by you, <l> ( b) by a minimum monthly payment which is at least

<bold> 1/36th </bold> ( rounded to the nearest dollar) of your balance on the

last day of any billing period in which any purchase is posted to your

Account, plus any amount over your Limit and past due amounts, or, <l> ( c)

should your new balance, including unpaid <bold> CREDIT CHARGES </bold> , be

less than <bold> &dollar;25.00 </bold> , your payment will be the amount of

your new balance. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#35:1> <h> <bold> 8. Credit Charges: </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-010#36:1> CREDIT CHARGES will be calculated at the date of each statement

of account, using an <bold> ANNUAL CREDIT RATE </bold> of <bold> 27.75%

</bold> .
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#37:1> The CREDIT CHARGES for each period covered by a statement of account

will be determined by multiplying the Annual Credit Rate by the fraction

represented by the number of days in the period in relation to 365 days, and

by then multiplying the result of the multiplication by the average daily

balance for the period.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#38:1> The average daily balance is determined by dividing the sum of the

daily balances for each day of the period by the number of days in the

period.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#39:1> The daily balance is determined at the end of each day by adding the

value of any purchases made on the Account since the beginning of the period

to the total balance of net capital at the end of the preceding period and,

where applicable, to the credit charges outstanding at the end of the

preceding period, and by subtracting payments received by the merchant since

the beginning of the period.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#40:1> The deemed reinvestment principle shall not be applied in this

calculation.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#41:1> A table of representative credit charges is set forth below. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#42:1> <h> <bold> 9. Pre-Payments: </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-010#43:1> You have the right to pay the entire balance in full or more than

the minimum monthly payment at any time.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#44:1> By doing so, you will reduce your <bold> CREDIT CHARGES </bold> .

</p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#45:1> <h> <bold> 10. Application of Payments Received: </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-010#46:1> Payment is first applied to ( a) past due insurance costs, if

any; ( b) past due Credit Charges; ( c) past due additional charges, such as

Dishonoured Cheque charges, if any; ( d) past due net capital; ( e) current

insurance costs; ( f) Current Credit charges; ( g) current additional

charges, such as Dishonoured Cheque charges; and ( h) current net capital.

liquidated damages in respect of each payment of yours which is dishonoured.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#52:1> This amount will be added to the Account balance. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#53:1> <h> <bold> 13. Liability of Beneficial: </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-010#54:1> Beneficial will not be responsible if any merchant refuses to

accept any purchase on your Account, or any merchandise purchased or service

secured by any use of the card.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#55:1> Any disputes between you and a merchant shall be settled by you or

the user of the card and the merchant.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#56:1> To the extent required by law, you will pay for the charged items

even though a dispute exists. </p>

CREDIT RATE </bold> in effect for your Beneficial Card at the time of

<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#63:1> <h> <bold> 15. Cancellation of Agreement: </bold> </h>

may, at our sole option, cancel it and demand the entire outstanding balance

plus any accrued credit charges immediately.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#65:1> In such case, you must immediately return your Beneficial Card upon

request.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#66:1> At all times, we continue to be the owner of any Beneficial Card

which we issue and may ourselves, or through our agents, take possession of

<ICE-CAN:W2D-010#89:1> For the purposes of this contract, the sole fact that the card has
