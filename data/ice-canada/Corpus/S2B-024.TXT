<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#1:1:A> We believe in equality <,> and equality of opportunity
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#2:1:A> We respect the individual
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#3:1:A> And we also have a very <,> strong sense of obligation to the

community as a whole <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#4:1:A> We believe that we are responsible for each other <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#5:1:A> We believe that it is our responsibility <,> every one of us to

ensure that Canadians <,> wherever they live enjoy a Canadian quality of life

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#6:1:A> The partnership of French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians

built a nation where French is not spoken only in Quebec <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#7:1:A> And I'm very proud to <}> <-> <}> <-> <.> s </.> </-> <+> sit </+>

by a riding where the majority of the people are Acadian and I'm very proud

that they are French and can <indig> parlent fran&ccedille;ais qui sont

vraiment de fran&ccedille;ais </indig>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#8:1:A> <O> French, 10 seconds </O> <&> applause, 5 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#9:1:A> In a country where English is not restricted to the other nine

provinces <,,> there are a lot of people in my province of Quebec who are as

good Quebecers as any one of us and who are <}> <-> <}> <-> <.> F </.> </->

<+> French </+> </}> </-> <=> English-speaking </=> </}> and they deserve to

be protected like anybody else
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#10:1:A> That is a fundamental <}> <-> <.> cuner </.> </-> <=> cornerstones

</=> </}> of what we call Canada <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#11:1:A> I want to state clearly that we will not accept any constitutional

change that will effectively split Canada in two nations <,> nine English

provinces <,> on one side and a French Quebec on the other side
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#12:1:A> Canada's aboriginal peoples are a fundamental characteristic of our

country too <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#13:1:A> But at the same time the treatment of aboriginal citizens is also a

test
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#14:1:A> It is a test of our values
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#15:1:A> It is a test that we have failed in the past
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#16:1:A> We must not fail again in the years ahead <&> applause, 10 seconds

</&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#17:1:A> We have built a country that has welcomed people from every

corner of the world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#18:1:A> Diversity <,> and multiculturalism <,> the fact that we can be

different and be Canadian too those are fundamental characteristics of Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#19:1:A> <O> French, 1 minute 45 seconds </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#20:1:A> Let me repeat Mister Speaker <,> we <}> <-> have </-> <=> in this

party <,> have </=> </}> recognized that Canada is far more than the sum of

its parts
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#21:1:A> It's far more than a community of communities
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#22:1:A> A strong national government has always been necessary to meet the

great challenges we face today
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#23:1:A> And a strong national government will remain necessary to meet the

global challenges we will encounter in the months <,> and years ahead <&>

applause, 10 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#24:1:A> The Liberal Party will not compromise on this principle
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#25:1:A> And our approach to constitutional change will be guided by this

principle
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#26:1:A> Let me be clear Mister Speaker in Canada we have a strong

foundation upon which to build the future
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#27:1:A> We do not have to rebuilt our nation from scratch
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#28:1:A> Instead we must improve upon what we have already
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#29:1:A> <O> French, 50 seconds </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#30:1:A> <&> part of phrase cut off </&> objectives of the Liberal Party on

a constitutional reform in Montreal <,> on April twenty-first
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#31:1:A> They will guide us in our work over the next few months
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#32:1:A> Let me repeat them here in the House of Commons
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#33:1:A> First <,> to propose an inspiring declaration of the nature of

Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#34:1:A> This declaration will set out the will of Canadians to live

together in a federal state <,> the principle which <?> government's at stake

</?> the values we share our commitment to two official languages a

recognition of our diverse cultural heritage a recognition of the

distinctiveness of Quebec and a recognition of the role of the aboriginal

people
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#35:1:A> The government has tabled such a declaration
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#36:1:A> We will examine its wording and propose improvement where necessary
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#37:1:A> Second a commitment to the Charter of Right and Freedom
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#38:1:A> All Canadians have an attachment to the fundamental right and

freedom found in the Charter
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#39:1:A> They want to see those freedoms strengthened
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#40:1:A> In the Liberal Party our position is very clear <,> <}> <-> we will

not </-> <=> we will not </=> </}> accept any constitutional change that <}>

<-> <.> de </.> </-> <=> diminishes </=> </}> the rights and freedom of

Canadians protected by the Charter
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#41:1:A> <&> applause starts </&> We will not accept that <,,> <&> applause

stops </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#42:1:A> Third <,> strengthening the Canadian economic union <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#43:1:A> <}> <-> In Canada <,> the federal state <,> we are </-> <=> In the

Canadian federal state we are </=> </}> entitled to expect the full benefits

associated with <,> the unrestricted mobility of people <,> goods <,>

services and capital
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#44:1:A> This is essential <,> if we are to develop internationally

competitive products services and technologies <,> things we need to meet <,>

the demands of globalization
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#45:1:A> Then we need to break down interprovincial trade barriers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#46:1:A> Those barriers <}> <-> are becoming </-> <=> are <,> coming </=>

</}> down all over the world and we must break them <,> down in Canada too
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#47:1:A> The government has made some proposal in this area <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#48:1:A> Our first reaction is that they need to be strengthened
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#49:1:A> They appear to be <,> too many loopholes
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#50:1:A> We will be recommending a number of major improvements <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#51:1:A> Fourth <,> institutional reform <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#52:1:A> The regions of Canada need to be more involved in decision-making

and policy-making at the national level
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#53:1:A> To meet the hopes and dreams of those who live in the west and the

Atlantic a reformed Senate is essential
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#54:1:A> It must be a Senate that is elected effective and equitable
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#55:1:A> Such a Senate should have the power to examine appointments to

important federal institutions and agencies
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#56:1:A> It should also protect the rights of minority language groups
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#57:1:A> And it should also require a double majority for legislation

touching upon the French language and culture <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#58:1:A> It appears the federal government has adopted a lot of <,> this

proposition
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#59:1:A> We will listen carefully to the view expressed before the committee
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#60:1:A> <O> French, 2 minute 45 seconds </O> <&> applause, 10 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#61:1:A> <O> French, 20 seconds </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#62:1:A> Since the creation of the Charter nine years ago the Supreme Court

of Canada is becoming more and more of a constitutional court
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#63:1:A> For that reason alone it is reasonable to expect that the provinces

should have greater involvement in the appointment of judges
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#64:1:A> To this end a formula along the lines of the one proposed in the

Meech Lake Accord could be adopted <,> provided there is a real

deadlock-breaking mechanism <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#65:1:A> Aboriginal people seven <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#66:1:A> Across Canada there is a broad consensus on the need to deal with

the problem faced by Canada's first citizens <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#67:1:A> There is <,> understanding of the need to deal with the status <,>

rights and claim of these people
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#68:1:A> In our view any constitutional package must enshrine <,> the rights

to self-government <&> applause starts </&> and it is part of the package

<,,> <&> applause stops </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#69:1:A> <}> <-> The process </-> <=> <,> Eight </=> </}> the amending

formula
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#70:1:A> The process by which the constitution is amended must be addressed
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#71:1:A> Liberals want a regionally-based amending formula <,> combining

flexibility with protection for each region <,> and significantly improved

public participations in the process
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#72:1:A> We believe it should be addressed now not later <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#73:1:A> Nine a national referendum <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#74:1:A> I have proposed <,> the use of a national referendum to ensure that

we get <,> the full participation <,> and approval of Canadian people
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#75:1:A> I believe that the final constitutional package that emerges from

the parliamentary committee report is put to the Canadian people for their

approval
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#76:1:A> That will be the supreme test of its legitimacy <&> Applause and

crowd reaction, 15 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#77:1:A> <O> French, 35 seconds </O> <&> applause, 10 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#78:1:A> <O> French, 1 minute 50 seconds </O> <&> applause, 7 seconds

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#81:1:A> <O> French, 45 seconds </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#82:1:A> I want to address a few comments to Canadians outside of Quebec
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#83:1:A> I say to them that the Meech Lake Accord failed for many reasons
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#84:1:A> One reason was that it did not address <,> the legitimate concerns

<,> of aboriginal peoples <,> of the north <,> and of Western and Atlantic

Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#85:1:A> I was amongst those who said that changes and improvements were

required <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#86:1:A> For a constitution to succeed now the aspirations of aboriginal

people as well as the hope and dreams of the people in the north west and

Atlantic must be addressed
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#87:1:A> I have consistently said in Quebec <,> and I have paid a certain

political price for it that the needs and aspirations of the rest of Canada

must be addressed in any constitutional reform package
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#88:1:A> I said we need a Canada <?> round </?> <&> applause, 10 seconds

</&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#89:1:A> But I want to say to the rest of Canada that Quebec too has

needs and aspirations which are legitimate <,> and which must be met <&>

applause and crown reaction, 10 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#90:1:A> <O> French, 25 seconds </O> <&> applause, 5 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#91:1:A> I appeal to the values we share of tolerance <,> and

particularly of generosity <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#92:1:A> Let us use the next few months to understand that Quebec's

distinctiveness makes Canada a greater country <&> applause, 5 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#93:1:A> Let us <,,> use the next few months to understand that the

flourishing French fact across Canada helps us <,> compete in a global

society
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#94:1:A> Let us use the next few months to understand that aboriginal

self-government is a test of our values
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#95:1:A> Let us <}> <-> all this <?> month </?> </-> <=> demonstrate over

the next few months </=> </}> <,> thoughtfulness <,,> reason <,> generosity

<,> a willingness to accommodate <,> and a skill to negotiate
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#96:1:A> Let us get this constitutional issue behind us so that we can be

equipped to deal with the real problems and challenges confronting us <&>

applause, 10 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#97:1:A> There is nobody <,> that has been obliged to talk more about

constitution than I since nineteen eighty so I hope that I will turn the page

soon and that we'll devote our attention to jobs to competitiveness to the

environment to health care to <,> make sure that we have our proper place in

the world of tomorrow <&> applause and crowd response, 10 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#98:1:A> But do not forget Mister Speaker that this government has

forgotten so often namely that we cannot get our constitutional house in

order until we get our economic house in order <&> applause, 10 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#99:1:A> The two issues are not distinct
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#100:1:A> They are intimately linked <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#101:1:A> We in the Liberal Party of Canada will be watching <,> and will

not permit the government to sweep our <,> economic crisis under the rug <,>

while the constitutional dance starts once again
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#102:1:A> Mister Speaker <,> our nation is an history of accomplishment
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#103:1:A> <}> <-> It <}> <-> <.> histor </.> </-> <+> history </+> </}> </->

<=> <,> its history </=> </}> is not one of conflict
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#104:1:A> The Liberal Party <,> has always worked to build a strong united

Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#105:1:A> I cherish <,> that legacy
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#106:1:A> And we shall continue <,> that work of building a strong and

united Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#107:1:A> There is a lot of work to do to improve this package
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#108:1:A> A lot of changes are necessary
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#109:1:A> We all have to work together <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#110:1:A> And <,> this time <,> the people of Canada are watching
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#111:1:A> I want to tell the House of Commons and the government that we

want to achieve <,,> the goals to keep this country together and give the

Canadians <,> a new constitution and a new departure for the twenty-first

century <,,> but we have to do it in a way that it is acceptable to all the

Canadians
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#112:1:A> We have to do it in a sense that <,> rather than divide us that

will make us closer to each other <,,> cos we have too much in common to be

complacent
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#113:1:A> And what I want to say that <,> we will this time be in opposition

to make some suggestions
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#114:1:A> And I hope that the government will listen because the last time

my predecessor had made some very good <,> propositions in this House some

good amendments that if had been accepted by this House then there would have

been no crisis but they were all rejected <&> applause, 15 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#115:1:A> Because they were all rejected <,> this time we will <,>

propose some amendments <,> we will help <,> in the committee to find

solutions we will make sure that every Canadian is comfortable with the new

constitution because ladies and gentlemen to be Canadian is the greatest

asset we're having
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#116:1:A> It is the asset that we want to give to all our children and

grandchildren because in spite of all the problems we're having when we

receive anybody <,> coming here
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#117:1:A> Like yesterday morning I had the privilege to meet with the

president of Ukraine <,,> everybody went they look at us they envy us and it

is our collective duty to make sure that this fantastic country remains one

united proud and independent Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#118:1:A> <indig> Merci beaucoup </indig> <&> applause, 55 seconds </&>

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#119:1:Z> <X> introduces next speaker </X> <&> applause, 15 seconds

</&>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-024#120:1:B> Thank you Mister Speaker
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#121:1:B> Today we begin a new journey as parliamentarians as people of

Canada <,> and as a nation <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#122:1:B> We know it will be a difficult journey
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#123:1:B> It will sometimes be exhausting sometimes painful
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#124:1:B> And that it will require from all of us on all sides of this house

as well as from coast to coast to coast an openness <,> and a tolerance for

the diversity of this country and a commitment for the strength of a united

Canada that acknowledges that diversity and which will truly make us strong

as we go into the twenty-first century <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#125:1:B> Mister Speaker although there will be problems along the way <,>

there is also the promise <,> of a better future <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#126:1:B> If we travel well <,> and if we move in the right direction and

achieve a destination we can agreee upon <,> as Canadians we can build that

better country a united and an enlightened Canada that stretches from the

Atlantic <,> to the Pacific <,> to the Arctic Ocean
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#127:1:B> That Canada Mister Speaker is the goal of the New Democratic Party
<ICE-CAN:S2B-024#128:1:B> I want to make it <,> clear that this indeed marks the starting

point of a journey </I>
