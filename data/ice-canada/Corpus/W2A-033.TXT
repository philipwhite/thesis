<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-033#12:1> <it> In this paper two procedures that were developed to make

better use of multispectral information from remotely sensed data for change

detection are discussed.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#13:1> Instead of applying principal component analysis ( PCA) to a combined

data set of original multispectral images, PCA was applied to difference

images.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#14:1> Thus, most change information was preserved in the first few

principal component images.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#15:1> Operations based on fuzzy set theory were proposed to combine change

information from different image channels into a single-image channel.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#16:1> Changed areas could then be extracted from this single image.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#17:1> Landsat Thematic Mapper ( TM) images acquired in two successive year

over Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, are used to illustrate these methods.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#18:1> Some strategies on the use of fuzzy set operations are discussed.

<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#19:1> <h> <bold> INTRODUCTION </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-033#20:1> In remote sensing, changes can be deter <l> mined by comparing

the spectral response differences at the same spatial location among a set of

two or more multispectral images acquired at different times.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#21:1> These images are first spatially registered.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#22:1> A commonly used change detection procedure then follows in which

changes are identified via thresholding a difference image that has been

obtained by subtracting one band of image on one date from the same band of

image on another date.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#23:1> However, it is usually not possible to detect changes occurring in a

region using only one spectral band because different types of changes may be

captured in different bands.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#24:1> Therefore, changes have to be enhanced and extracted from

multispectral imagery. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-033#25:1> Two types of procedures for using multi <l> spectral data in

change component enhance <l> ment are commonly used.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#26:1> The first type involves simple image arithmetic between images of the

same spectral band for two dates.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#27:1> For convenience, we define the two images obtained for two different

dates of the same spectral band as band-pair images.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#28:1> Image arithmetic includes rationing and differ <l> encing band-pair

images.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#29:1> Images so generated are referred to as change com <l> ponent images.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#30:1> To locate and identify change automatically, change component images

are thesholded or classified ( Jensen, 1986; Fung and LeDrew, 1988; Pilon

<it> et al. </it> , 1988; Singh, 1989).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#31:1> To detect changes visually, rationed or differenced band-pair images

can be ana <l> lyzed based on their colour displays on a video monitor or

photographic products ( Howarth and Wickware, 1981; Howarth and Boassan,

1983).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#32:1> Although logically straight <l> forward due to increased data

redundancy and display difficulties, this type of procedure becomes

inefficient to use when the image dimension ( that is, the number of spectral

bands) exceeds three. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-033#33:1> To overcome these difficulties, a second type of change component

enhancement pro <l> cedure employs image transformation methods.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#34:1> Transformation methods include vegetation indexing ( VI) ( Tucker,

1979), tasseled cap analysis ( KT-Transform) ( Kauth and Thomas, 1976),

change vector analysis ( CVA) ( Malila, 1980), and principal component

analysis ( PCA) ( Lodwick, 1979; Byrne <it> et al. </it> , 1980; Ingebristen

<it> et al. </it> , 1985; Fung and LeDrew, 1987).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#35:1> By image transformation, the change information recorded in origi <l>

nal multispectral data can be preserved in a relatively small number of

components.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#36:1> Rather than serving as general enhance <l> ment tools, the VI and

KT-Transform methods were developed specifically for such purposes as

enhancing the vegetation or the soil component.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#37:1> While CVA has the potential of summarizing various types of change

components and their magnitudes into separate image channels, it has rarely

been applied since its introduction.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#38:1> Among these transformation techniques, the PCA method has been most

commonly used.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#39:1> Researchers using PCA for change detection have reported that the

minor component images are likely to contain most of the change information

when multispectral images that have been obtained on two dates are applied as

an integrated data set.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#40:1> The amount of change informa <l> tion contained in each principal

component image, however, may vary from image to image.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#41:1> It may not be an easy task to determine which principal component

image to work with.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#42:1> In addition, the use of PCA in such a manner is subject to the

condition that the areas of changes have to be a small proportion of the

entire study area ( Richards, 1984; Fung and LeDrew, 1987). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-033#43:1> It would be desirable to deal with only one image channel and to

extract most, if not all, change information from this channel of image.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#44:1> In this paper, a method is presented for transforming change

information into one image channel from images of different spectral bands.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#45:1> The main objectives are: &bullet; to introduce an alternative method

on the use of PCA for change component enhancement with which change infor

<l> mation is guaranteed to be preserved in the major comp <l> onent images

regardless the proportion of changed area in a study area; and &bullet; to

demonstrate the effectiveness of fuzzy set theory in com <l> bining change

information from different image channels into a single-image channel. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#46:1> <h> <bold> METHOD </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-033#47:1> The change detection procedure proposed in this study can be

divided into six steps: &bullet; spatially register images from two different

dates; &bullet; undertake a band-pair image differencing for each spectral

band and reduce registration noise; &bullet; apply PCA transformation to the

multispectral difference image; &bullet; determine change membership

functions for a number of selected change component images; &bullet; apply

fuzzy operations to combine change information in different change component

images into a single image; &bullet; determine changed areas based on the

image generated at step five. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-033#48:1> At step one, two images from different dates can be registered

using a geometric correction program.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#49:1> After the image-to-image registration, two images with the same

coordinate system are obtained: X = { x <sb> i </sb> | i = 1, 2,

&dotted-line;, n} of date one and Y = { y <sb> i </sb> | i = 1, 2,

&dotted-line;, n} of date two, where x <sb> i </sb> ' = [ x <sb> i1 </sb> , x

<sb> i2 </sb> , &dotted-line;, x <sb> ip </sb> ] and y <sb> i </sb> ' = [ y

<sb> i1 </sb> , y <sb> i2 </sb> , &dotted-line;, y <sb> ip </sb> ] .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#50:1> The parameter n denotes the number of pixels in an image and p the

number of spectral bands. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-033#51:1> At the second step, a difference image, DIF <sb> j </sb> , for

each spectral band j, can be created, where DIF <sb> j </sb> = { &delta; <sb>

<it> ij </it> </sb> =(x <sb> ij </sb> - y <sb> ij </sb> ) | i = 1, 2,

&dotted-line;, n} and j = 1, 2, &dotted-line; p.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#52:1> A grey-scale mapping can then be applied to every difference image,

DIF <sb> j </sb> , j = 1, 2, &dotted-line; p.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#53:1> This further reduces registration noise in each difference image (

Gong <it> et al. </it> , 1992). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-033#54:1> In traditional change detection, one difference image of a

specific spectral band is selected among these difference images.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#55:1> This difference image should contain more change information than the

other difference images for a particular application.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#56:1> An image thresholding technique is then applied to detect changes

using the selected difference image ( Jensen, 1986; Fung and LeDrew, 1988).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#57:1> For example, DIF <sb> 2 </sb> , the red spectral band differ <l> ence

image of Landsat multispectral scanner ( MSS) data is usually considered to

contain more information on rural to urban land-cover changes than the other

three MSS bands.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#58:1> Thresholds T <sb> 1 </sb> and T <sb> 2 </sb> can be determined on the

histogram of DIF <sb> 2 </sb> using the mean ( ave) and standard deviation (

std) ( <bold> Figure 1 </bold> ) .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#59:1> Deciding whether a pixel has changed is simply a matter of testing

whether &delta; <sb> <it> ij </it> </sb> falls outside of range [ T <sb> 1

</sb> , T <sb> 2 </sb> ] . </p> <O> Chart </O> <O> Figure 1 caption </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-033#60:1> Two problems are associated with the above-mentioned traditional

method, and they will be overcome by subsequent steps three to five.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#61:1> As mentioned in the introduction, the first problem is that different

types of change information are con <l> tained in different spectral bands;

thus, the use of one spectral band usually does not allow every type of

changes to be detected.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#62:1> The second problem is that once thresholding is applied to a

difference image, change information occurring at smaller mag <l> nitudes (

that is, within range [ T <sb> 1 </sb> , T <sb> 2 </sb> ] ) will be lost.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#63:1> Also, noise could be included as change if its magnitude falls

outside range [ T <sb> 1 </sb> , T <sb> 2 </sb> ] . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-033#64:1> At step three, the difference images are used to generate a

variance-covariance matrix.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#65:1> This is used to find a new set of axes according to the eigen

structure of the feature space.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#66:1> With the variance-covariance matrix, PCA can be applied to the

difference images.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#67:1> The resultant principal component images are called principal

component difference images, denoted by PCD <sb> j </sb> = { &delta; <sb> eij

</sb> | i = 1, 2, &dotted-line;, n} where j = 1, 2, &dotted-line;, p ;

&delta; <sb> eij </sb> is a pixel value for pixel i in the jth principal

component which results from a linear trans <l> formation of the difference

images with the transformation coeffi <l> cients determined with PCA.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#68:1> PCD images are obtained from a p-dimensional data set { x <sb> i

</sb> - y <sb> i </sb> | i = 1, 2, &dotted-line;, n} instead of the

traditional application of PCA in change detection where a com <l> bined

two-date data set,{(x <sb> i </sb> ' y <sb> i' </sb> ' ) ' | i = 1, 2,

&dotted-line;, n} of two p dimen <l> sions, is used.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#69:1> Because the variance in a difference image represents primarily

change information and the purpose of PCA is to preserve most variances into

the first few principal com <l> ponents, the application of PCA to difference

images will result in most change information preserved in the first few PCD

images. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-033#70:1> At step four, the first two or three PCD images containing change

information are selected.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#71:1> The exact number of PCDs is determined according to the eigenvalues

and the correlation matrix of difference images.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#72:1> Each selected PCD image and its histogram are analyzed, and a fuzzy

membership function of change is empirically defined based on the analysis

results.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#73:1> From <bold> Figure 1 </bold> , it is reasonable to assume that the

more distant a pixel value &delta; is from the average, ave, the more likely

is that pixel to fall into the change class.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#74:1> Based on the shape of the histogram of a PCD image, parameters of a

fuzzy membership function of change can be determined.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#75:1> While a fuzzy membership function may take a variety of forms (

Zadeh, 1978), in the case of <bold> Figure 1 </bold> an inverse

triangular-shaped function may be suitable.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#76:1> A more sophisticated change membership function may be determined

based on the knowledge of the various types of change in the study area.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#77:1> For example, statistics on various change types can be estimated from

selected training samples. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-033#78:1> A fuzzy membership function of change, &mu;cj(&delta; <sb> e

</sb> ) , can be defined as: <O> mathematical equation </O> where &mu; <sb>

cj </sb> ( &delta; <sb> e </sb> ) represents the degree of pixel value

&delta; <sb> e </sb> in image PCD <sb> j </sb> belonging to a fuzzy set of

change, C.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#79:1> L&delta; , ave, and H&delta; are the three parameters defining the

inverse triangular-shaped func <l> tion.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#80:1> L&delta; and H&delta; can be determined empirically by examining the

histogram distribution of image PCD <sb> j </sb> , and ave is the average

pixel value in image PCD <sb> j </sb> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#81:1> A graphical form of &mu; <sb> cj </sb> ( &delta; <sb> e </sb> ) is

shown in <bold> Figure 2 </bold> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#82:1> After applying a fuzzy membership function, &mu; <sb> cj </sb> (

&delta; <sb> e </sb> ) , to an image, PCD <sb> j </sb> a change membership (

CM) image, CM <sb> j </sb> = { &mu; <sb> cj </sb> ( &delta; <sb> ei </sb> ) |

i = 1, 2, &dotted-line;, n}, is obtained. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-033#83:1> At the fifth step, various change information from different CM

images can be combined into one image, CCM, by applying the fuzzy set theory

( Zadeh, 1965).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#84:1> Most operations based on the fuzzy set theory can be realized by

using three basic types of fuzzy set operator: fuzzy union ( &square-root;),

fuzzy intersection ( <O> mathematical symbol </O> ) , and fuzzy complement (

<O> mathematical symbol </O> ) .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#85:1> While there are a number of definitions for fuzzy union and fuzzy

intersection, the maximum and minimum rule are used in this study.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#86:1> Therefore, fuzzy union of &mu; <sb> 1 </sb> and &mu; <sb> 2 </sb> is

equivalent to max ( &mu; <sb> 1 </sb> , &mu; <sb> 2 </sb> ) , and their fuzzy

intersection is min( &mu; <sb> 1 </sb> , &mu; <sb> 2 </sb> ) .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#87:1> A fuzzy complement of &mu; <sb> 1 </sb> is 1 - &mu; <sb> 1 </sb> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#88:1> For example, if one wishes to combine change information in three CM

images in such a manner that both the subtle changes in CM <sb> 3 </sb> and

changes in either CM <sb> 1 </sb> or CM <sb> 2 </sb> are included in the

final resultant image, CCM = { &mu;(&delta; <sb> i </sb> ) | i = 1, 2,

&dotted-line;, n}, the following operation can be used: <O> mathematical

equation </O> where 1 - &mu; <sb> c </sb> 3(&delta; <sb> i </sb> ) represents

the complement of &mu; <sb> c3 </sb> ( &delta; <sb> i </sb> ) because subtle

changes have lower degrees of change membership in image CM <sb> 3 </sb> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#89:1> Fuzzy set operations should be defined according to the

characteristics of changes. <O> Chart </O> <O> Figure 2 caption </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#90:1> In most cases, successful change information extraction requires that

knowledge about the study area and expert knowledge on various change types

be properly represented with fuzzy membership functions and fuzzy set

operations. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-033#91:1> Once the desirable change information from different image

channels has been combined into one image CCM, at the final step, the CCM

itself can be stored in a database to represent change information.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#92:1> One can also apply the thresholding or classification technique to

determine and identify areas of change and to make a change map. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#93:1> <h> <bold> TEST AND RESULTS </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-033#94:1> In this section, steps one to five on the use of PCA and fuzzy

set theory in change detection in the previous section are il <l> lustrated

using an example.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#95:1> However, no attempt was made for step six to undertake a thorough

change detection of the study area.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#96:1> Instead, the purpose is to combine change information from different

image channels into a newly created image channel. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-033#97:1> The principal component analysis module, PCA, image arith <l>

metic, ARI, and image display programs in the EASI/PACE image analysis

<ICE-CAN:W2A-033#98:1> Programs implementing the grey-scale mapping, the fuzzy mem <l>

bership functions, and the fuzzy set operations have been developed by the
