<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#3:1> We used to live in Chicago which I never much liked.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#4:1> Summers were always hot and humid and in winter the wind cut right

through any protective clothing.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#5:1> Too many people, too much decay.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#6:1> Before we moved to Calgary we were living in a small rented flat with

most of our things in storage.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#7:1> Laura had insisted I sell the house.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#8:1> A Chicago police detective called us one day and told us they'd caught

a burglar who had confessed to robbing our house.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#9:1> Why hadn't I reported the burglary?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#10:1> There must have been some mistake, I told him.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#11:1> Was my name Jeff?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#12:1> Was my wife's name Laura?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#13:1> Had I given her a silver and diamond necklace with an inscription on

the clasp?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#14:1> The burglary had taken place more than a month before the phone call

and we hadn't known.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#15:1> We weren't the first people not to know they'd been robbed, he

explained.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#16:1> Especially when the guy was a real pro like the one they'd caught.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#17:1> But Laura made me sell the house.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#18:1> It made her feel violated and vulnerable she told me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#19:1> What's the difference?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#20:1> I'd asked.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#21:1> We'd been living there over a month since it happened and never even

noticed.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#22:1> It was knowing, she'd said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#23:1> Things were never very pleasant in Chicago after that.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#24:1> Even for Laura.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#25:1> I got a great offer from The University of Calgary medical school and

the Foothills Hospital Department of Pediatrics to be on staff and teach.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#26:1> Laura hadn't wanted to leave but when she visited she liked Calgary.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#27:1> Walking around the neighbourhood of the hospital she saw a beautiful

little house we eventually bought.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#28:1> It was bigger than the house in Chicago but not too big.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#29:1> A nice family house that would be great for kids.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#30:1> She thought it was funny I was a pediatrician and didn't want kids.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#31:1> How can you tell other people how to take care of their kids?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#32:1> You don't know, she said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#33:1> Not yet, I told her.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#34:1> I didn't feel we were ready. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#35:1> I'd walked to work that day.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#36:1> I went home now along the winding sidewalks, feeling the warmth of

the sunset on my back.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#37:1> I was surprised by the late September orange, red, and pale

yellow-greens of the trees.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#38:1> When had they changed?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#39:1> I'd been planning to take Laura out to dinner but I'd had to cancel

when the clinic filled up at five o'clock.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#40:1> Laura said she'd microwave a slice of the frozen pizza we'd brought

with us from Chicago.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#41:1> I said I'd grab a bite at the hospital cafeteria. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#42:1> The streetlamp in front of the house was already on.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#43:1> Coming up the long stairs in the front yard I felt tired and had to

rest.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#44:1> It was past eight o'clock already, despite the sunset.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#45:1> I thought about when I could get to the yard work.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#46:1> The leaves were going to need raking and there was some kind of weed

that had choked off and killed a bush in the hedge. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#47:1> When I came inside, I could hear Joni Mitchell playing loudly,

which is always a bad sign.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#48:1> Laura was in the TV room downstairs on the old armchair with her legs

drawn up under her singing along and crying. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#49:1> " Hi," I said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#50:1> Laura looked at me singing <quote> " &dotted-line; and her heart

is full and hollow like a cactus tree while she's so busy being free."

</quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#51:1> I hate it when she sings Joni Mitchell songs to me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#52:1> I don't know what she's talking about.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#53:1> I sat on the padded armrest next to her and slid my hand over her

shoulders.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#54:1> She hunched her shoulders and turned her head sideways and the

muscles thumped against each other.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#55:1> Her shoulders hurt her all the time and she cracks them to relieve

the ache.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#56:1> It just makes them worse in the long run. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#57:1> " Like rocks," I said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#58:1> " Rocks," Laura said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#59:1> " So what happened?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#60:1> " Jerry hit Lucy over the head with a chair." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#61:1> " What?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#62:1> " Lucy just called me from the hospital.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#63:1> They think she's got a con <l> cussion.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#64:1> They're going to admit her for observation." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#65:1> " Is she alright?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#66:1> " No, she's not alright.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#67:1> Her husband hit her over the head with a goddamn chair and she's got

a god <l> damn concussion.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#68:1> Does that sound alright to you?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#69:1> " Is anybody with her?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#70:1> " No.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#71:1> We live in Calgary, for God's sake." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#72:1> " I mean does she have any friends who could be with her?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#73:1> " How should I know if she's got any friends?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#74:1> She doesn't have any family because her sister lives in goddamn

Calgary." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#75:1> " What hospital?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#76:1> " God.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#77:1> I didn't even ask." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#78:1> " Probably Rush.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#79:1> She's near there.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#80:1> I know some people at Rush.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#81:1> I'll call Bill Weddington."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#82:1> I said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#83:1> " He'll look in on her." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#84:1> " He's a pediatrician.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#85:1> You're a pediatrician.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#86:1> What do you know?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#87:1> You don't know." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#88:1> I listened to the needle click on the empty bands at the end of

the Joni Mitchell record then I got up and turned it off.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#89:1> When I put the record away Laura said, " I don't want to hear any

more Joni Mitchell." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#90:1> " That's good." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#91:1> Laura looked at me sharply. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#92:1> " Can I get you anything?" I said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#93:1> " What?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#94:1> " You want some tea?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#95:1> " No, nothing.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#96:1> Do you think I should fly to Chicago?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#97:1> " No.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#98:1> I mean, did Lucy ask you to?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#99:1> " If Lucy asked me to I would have been gone already.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#100:1> You would have got home and found a note," Laura said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#101:1> " Well, I'm going to have some tea." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#102:1> " She shouldn't have to ask.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#103:1> I should just fly down." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#104:1> " Don't." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#105:1> " What do you mean don't?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#106:1> " I need some tea."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#107:1> I didn't want to have this conversation now.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#108:1> I knew what she was going to say and what I was going to say and how

it'd end.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#109:1> I went upstairs to get my tea. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#110:1> Laura was talking while the water ran into the electric kettle.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#111:1> Laura was talking when I plugged it in and the heating coils hissed

and bubbled.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#112:1> She came up the stairs and the kettle began to whistle.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#113:1> I picked out something decaffeinated.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#114:1> I didn't want to be up all night. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#115:1> " Jeff!
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#116:1> Why don't you answer for God's sake?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#117:1> Laura stood at the top of the stairs glaring furiously at me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#118:1> " You haven't heard a thing I've said." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#119:1> " Honey, you know I can't hear anything with the racket that

thing makes." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#120:1> " You weren't listening." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#121:1> " I was listening but you were downstairs and the kettle was

on."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#122:1> I squeezed the tea bag and tossed it into the garbage.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#123:1> " What were you saying?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#124:1> " You don't care." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#125:1> " If I didn't care I wouldn't ask." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#126:1> " It doesn't mean anything when you ask.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#127:1> You just ask because you think you should ask.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#128:1> You asked me if I would mind moving to Calgary and I told you I

would damn well mind and did you care?"
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#129:1> Laura said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#130:1> " No." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#131:1> " What did she do?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#132:1> " What are you talking about?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#133:1> " I was wondering about your sister." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#134:1> " What do you mean what did she do?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#135:1> " I can't imagine Jerry hitting Lucy with a chair." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#136:1> " Well, he did." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#137:1> " But can you imagine?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#138:1> Jerry?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#139:1> Laura looked at me with her head twisted.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#140:1> I thought she was going to crack her shoulders again but she was

just looking.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#141:1> Like she was a bird and I was a worm. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#142:1> " You think he had a reason." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#143:1> " He had to have a reason.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#144:1> I mean, Jerry, after all." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#145:1> " You're as sick a bastard as he is.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#146:1> You really think there is any reason, <it> any reason </it> , to hit

someone over the head with a chair?"
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#147:1> Laura was shak <l> ing mad. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#148:1> " Let's sit down, honey."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#149:1> I tried to slip my arm around her waist and move her into the living

room but she hit my arm.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#150:1> Hard.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#151:1> I went ahead and sat down in my chair.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#152:1> I blew on the tea and listened to Laura rattle bottles on the

refrigerator door.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#153:1> Something would fall when she slammed it.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#154:1> Oyster sauce.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#155:1> She would clean it up right away and somehow that would calm her.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#156:1> " Honey," I said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#157:1> " Remember the oyster sauce." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#158:1> " I'm not going to slam the door.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#159:1> Okay?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#160:1> Some of us learn from our mistakes." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#161:1> Laura brought me some cut up lemon.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#162:1> I wanted to hug her but she'd just push my arm away.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#163:1> She was thinking of something else.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#164:1> Standing by the chair, holding the plate with the lemon, looking out

the picture win <l> dow.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#165:1> Weak orange sunlight seeped in now the trees were half bare.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#166:1> Tiny threads and dust motes hung in the light beams.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#167:1> I looked at them and wondered what kept them up.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#168:1> Just waiting out Laura.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#169:1> The plate in her hand dipped and I finally reached up and took it

from her. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#170:1> " Thanks, honey.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#171:1> I love you," I told her. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#172:1> Now she started to cry.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#173:1> I put the cup and the plate of lemons down, stood and hugged her,

running my hand over her aching neck and letting her rich brown hair slip

smooth and cool through my fingers.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#174:1> She dug her face into my chest, wrapped her arms around my bony hips

and hugged me back, smelling like cashews and lemons, crying in the light

shafts. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#175:1> " How can you think there's a reason?" Laura said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#176:1> " It's not like you." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#177:1> " To think he must have a reason?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#178:1> I'm not saying he's got any excuse for hitting her.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#179:1> But what can possibly have gone through his mind?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#180:1> " I've never trusted him." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#181:1> " Jerry?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#182:1> He does all our taxes, he wrote our wills, he makes most of our

investments." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#183:1> " It's not the same," Laura said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#184:1> " When it comes to love it isn't the same.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#185:1> Some men act crazy when it comes to love.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#186:1> You're not like that.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#187:1> You don't know.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#188:1> You would never hit me over the head with a chair." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#189:1> " No." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#190:1> " Just yourself." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#191:1> I didn't say anything.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#192:1> I knew what she was talking about but I didn't say anything. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#193:1> Laura started laughing.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#194:1> I loved to hear her laugh.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#195:1> It was a low sexy throaty laugh.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#196:1> In college when she asked me why I loved her I used to say it was

because of her laugh and the way she smelled like roasted cashews.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#197:1> " You remember when you hit your <l> self with the chair?" Laura

asked. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#198:1> " Yes."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#199:1> I held her close and inhaled.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#200:1> " Let's go to bed." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#201:1> Laura pulled back and looked at me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#202:1> We hadn't made love in a month.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#203:1> My fault.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#204:1> Too much work, I'd told her.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#205:1> Too much work, too many distractions.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#206:1> Too many unhappy stories from unhappy parents of every patient I'd

examined. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#207:1> In bed, Laura said she couldn't.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#208:1> She was thinking about Lucy and Jerry. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#209:1> " I think she should call Sol Epstein," Laura said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#210:1> " Jeff?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#211:1> Don't you think she should call Sol Epstein?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#212:1> What are you thinking about?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#213:1> " Why should she call Sol?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#214:1> " Because he's a friend and a killer divorce lawyer." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#215:1> " What makes you think she wants to divorce Jerry?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#216:1> " Come on." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#217:1> " Come on?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#218:1> " She'd have to be crazy to go hack to him.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#219:1> My sister is not crazy.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#220:1> A little impulsive, a little wild, but not crazy.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#221:1> She is not one of those women who could just forgive and forget."

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#222:1> " How could that happen?" I said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#223:1> " They've been together four years." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#224:1> " Five.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#225:1> Married four." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#226:1> " Five years and suddenly he hits her with a chair?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#227:1> " He was trying to kill her." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#228:1> " You really think they'll get divorced'?" I asked. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#229:1> " Some things you just can't patch up.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#230:1> Some things just are so bad you can't fix them.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#231:1> How could she ever feel safe again?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#232:1> She'd never know if he was going to go after her.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#233:1> She wants kids, for God's sake.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#234:1> You think it would be a good idea for her to have kids with a man

who tried to crush her skull?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#235:1> " And you don't think she did anything to provoke him?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#236:1> " What could possibly provoke any sane person to hit somebody

over the head with a chair?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#237:1> " Bob Marcus," I whispered. </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#239:1> Laura sat up in the water bed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#240:1> " I just wondered if maybe she'd had an affair." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#241:1> " You said Robert Marcus." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#242:1> " I was thinking about Lucy." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-003#243:1> " No, you weren't.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#244:1> You were thinking about me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#245:1> You were talking about Robert and me like you thought I was having

an affair. </I> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-003#X246:1> Like something that happened fifteen years ago &dotted-line;" </p>
