<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#1:1> <h> 7 Feb 94 </h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#2:1> <h> Dear Mum - </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#3:1> Well, now we are having colder weather - I hope it doesn't snow.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#4:1> All those nice little flowers are going to suffer, not to mention me!

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#5:1> Your long letter arrived on Monday - thanks - and here it is

Monday again.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#6:1> It was a busy week - and <@> Erhard </@> <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+>

</}> <@> Hubert </@> went to a hockey game at <@> UCAN </@> on Friday, we

went out to dinner on Saturday - <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> yesterday I

went out and got a rhubarb root from <@> Becky Hansen </@> , the woman I met

on Saturday.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#7:1> I think she's written some books - maybe one on totem poles.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#8:1> ( Sorry, that pen was getting scratchy - here's a better one…)
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#9:1> Look her up on the catalogue. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#10:1> Now to reply to your letter - ( 1) yes <@> Sonya </@> <}> <-> &

</-> <+> and </+> </}> I did have fun at the Bay <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+>

</}> I bought two pull-on brassieres - this time <ul> not </ul> cotton, which

goes a horrible shade of grey <ul> instantly </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#11:1> ( 2) Well, all right, I see what you mean about <ul> talismanic </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#12:1> Was that Shields?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#13:1> I just sent off to the Strathy an example of <mention> <ul> coiffeur

</ul> </mention> ( when <mention> <ul> coiffure </ul> </mention> was meant)

from <ul> the Stone Diaries </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#14:1> ( 3) I didn't <ul> tell </ul> you about the pool because I hadn't

realized it was open <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> heated in the winter.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#15:1> They are now <}> <-> questionning </-> <+> questioning </+> </}> the

expense of the heating - so I'd better start using it!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#16:1> ( Maybe this morning?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#17:1> - Cringe cringe).
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#18:1> ( 4) I enclose some <@> Hubert </@> soccer pictures - they have now

started to tie their games, which is real progress.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#19:1> We'll see about getting you to a game - it ought to be easy because

he plays every weekend.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#20:1> ( 5) No I didn't get a cheque for &dollar;5350 - I'm busy, but not to

<del> that </del> the extent that I wouldn't have noticed!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#21:1> I guess the check mark beside that item means you figured out what

happened to it.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#22:1> ( 6) re the &dollar;10,000 - well, I think it would <ul> save </ul>

us more interest than you could <ul> earn </ul> on it, and I think we will

sell the <@> Kavic </@> house before you need it back - so yes, we would like

to put it in our open mortgage ( Maybe holding a little out to cover the

taxes on <@> Kavic </@> , <@> Shine </@> Terrace, here, etc!) </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#23:1> How can we arrange the transaction?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#24:1> ( and again, shall it be interest - free?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#25:1> - at least until the day you need the interest?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#26:1> If you have second thoughts, voice them!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#27:1> We are thinking of changing the mortgage to a closed 6 month one,

because the rate for that is 5.5% ( as opposed to 6.25%) - so we should

either do it now or in August. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#28:1> I read <ul> The Most Beautiful House in the World </ul> ( I seem

to recall raves from you about <ul> Home </ul> - and I see why.) </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#29:1> <@> Sonya </@> will be over here next weekend at a book fair

downtown - hooray - have you read anything by Buchi Emecheta?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#30:1> - I'm teaching <ul> Joys of Motherhood </ul> - but you might enjoy

her semi-autobiographical stuff more, In the Ditch <}> <-> & </-> <+> and

</+> </}> Second - class Citizen.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#31:1> And have I ever told you about Sam Selvon?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#32:1> He's very funny - try <ul> The Lonely Londoners </ul> <}> <-> & </->

<+> and </+> </}> <ul> Moses ascending </ul> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#33:1> Must zoom, love, <@> Margaret </@> </p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#34:2> <h> 25 January 1994 </h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#35:2> <h> Dear Mum - </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#36:2> I'm sorry we didn't get shopping ( <@> Sonya </@> <}> <-> & </->

<+> and </+> </}> I spent an hour in the lingerie section at the Bay!)
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#37:2> I think my eyes are bigger than my stomach - I always think I can do

more than I can.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#38:2> I blame it on your supportive parenting! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#39:2> 70 is 3 score years and 10 <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}>

therefore talismanic ( Quoth the paragon!). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#40:2> I sent you the Richardson Greenshields letter for interest

really.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#41:2> If you don't want to put it ( the &dollar;20,000) into a Mutual Fund

or whatever, maybe we <ul> should </ul> put it in our mortgage.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#42:2> I will find out what difference this would make to our monthly

payments <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> see if it's more than you are

earning in interest.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#43:2> But should we not ( you <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> I) have a

piece of paper writing out these things?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#44:2> I have now received &dollar;20,000 from you in 1982 and &dollar;2,500

in 1993, right?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#45:2> And if you ever need it, it will come back. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#46:2> Isn't the weather amazing?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#47:2> I love it!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#48:2> We went out to dinner in North Vancouver on Friday <}> <-> & </-> <+>

and </+> </}> it just reinforced my feeling that we made the right choice to

move here.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#49:2> They get up at 5.30 or 6 so as to beat the traffic <}> <-> & </-> <+>

and </+> </}> often spend an hour getting home.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#50:2> It took us an hour, and we started after 6.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#51:2> They do have a beautiful house with a view over Vancouver but it's

not worth it! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#52:2> On Saturday, <@> Hubert </@> 's soccer team played and tied 1-1 -

<@> Hubert </@> scored the only goal.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#53:2> This was quite satisfying to him because he hadn't gone to bed <ul>

particularly </ul> early the night before ( he had stayed by himself).
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#54:2> Yesterday his basketball team won.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#55:2> On Saturday we watched volleyball at <@> UCAN </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#56:2> Anyway, you are requested to find out when the World Cup is on TV

because we hear from <@> Marcus </@> that Switzerland made the finals.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#57:2> <}> <-> V. </-> <+> Very </+> </}> exciting.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#58:2> We may all have to come <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> watch it at

your place. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#59:2> Today will be wild ( it's 8 am) - I have a " reading" student at

11.30; lecture to hear at 12.30, meeting <}> <-> w. </-> <+> with </+> </}>

colleague at 1.30, grad class at 3.30.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#60:2> Last week was all messed up because the grad students had a

conference <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> thus I cancelled my grad class

for last week, so this week I have two. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#61:2> Horrible ( although I do like the students!).
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#62:2> Must shift myself,
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#63:2> Love, <@> Margaret </@> . </p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#64:3> <h> 5 March 1994 </h> <h> Dear Mum - </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#65:3> I realized ( after I sealed my last letter) that I had forgotten

to thank you for the loan ( Thanks!) and to tell you that I checked my will

<}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> it does provide for payment of debts out of

my estate.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#66:3> We also wrote it down in our mortgage record book.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#67:3> I am going to Kingston on April 10 and will be back late April 25 (

can't remember how specific I was about this). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#68:3> <@> Hubert </@> 's team won again 1-0, a real squeaker.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#69:3> In fact, a member of the opposing team kicked the ball in!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#70:3> Another beautiful day, lovely green field, mountains in the distance.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#71:3> And did I tell you we found a new bike at second-hand price for him

<}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> turned in his old one.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#72:3> So he's been out practice riding it ( with helmet!) - we might

consider riding it to school next week if the weather improves. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#73:3> Soon term will be over - I can't really believe it!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#74:3> Ug - I have to make up 3 exams <ul> <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}>

</ul> mark them.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#75:3> Not to mention a lot of other stuff.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#76:3> Oh, well, thank heaven the British managed to elevate muddling

through to a virtue! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#77:3> <@> Hubert </@> and <@> Erhard </@> are playing Monopoly - lucky

I went bankrupt and left to tidy my desk, eh? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#78:3> We read that the Canadian soccer team will be holding a practice

in Vancouver - maybe I will investigate going, although every little soccer

player ( <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> big) will want to go I expect! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#79:3> <@> Hubert </@> is now supplementing his diet of Garfields with

Jack London and Gerry Paulsen, so it looks as if he's through the child <}>

<-> lit </-> <+> literature </+> </}> barrier.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#80:3> I gave him a Hornblower book <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> <ul>

Catcher in the Rye </ul> - we'll see if either " takes".
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#81:3> Now when we're at the library I control my urge to take out fat

irrelevant novels <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> stick to finding him

books.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#82:3> He handed in a " project" on Germany in French - he doesn't seem to

actually write anything in English, instead engaging in something he calls

<mention> Commskills </mention> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#83:3> Hm.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#84:3> Oh well he's learning how to punctuate I suppose.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#85:3> I'm tempted to get him to take the novel he wrote in grade 5 in to

school just to startle the teacher! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#86:3> I enclose some news on vitamins which may explain some of the

startling effect of your tonic! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#87:3> Keep me posted re your plans.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#88:3> Love, <@> Margaret </@> </p> </I>


<I> <h> February 28, 1994

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#89:4> Dear Mum,
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#90:4> Thanks for writing us so promptly to let us know you made it home all

right.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#91:4> I'm sorry that my dimwittedness caused you to miss that bus - - but

I'll know how to do it next time.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#92:4> I'm really pleased to have met <@> Brenda </@> and to have seen the

Cassatt show, which I only would have thought about if you hadn't been here.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#93:4> It is nice to get an idea of how you spend your time peering at those

interesting birds and carrying newspapers hither and yon!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#94:4> Thanks for the extra Mondays and clippings, too.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#95:4> I am enclosing the gallery lists from the latest <ul> Georgia

Straight </ul> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#96:4> I hope you weren't too tired to appreciate the skating or to

grate carrots.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#97:4> Too bad about the hockey, eh? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#98:4> <@> Hubert </@> 's team actually won a game on Saturday - 3-1.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#99:4> However, it was raining and freezing throughout, and poor <@>

Lawrence </@> hurt a finger in practice ( probably broken), so it wasn't

unrelieved fun.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#100:4> <@> Hubert </@> got an assist, and another boy got two goals, so

they were happy.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#101:4> You had the better viewing weather, anyway.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#102:4> Today was rainy again, but <@> Hubert </@> watched a soccer game

over at <@> UCAN </@> and found it thrilling.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#103:4> We rearranged the bedroom, and I think it looks much tidier.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#104:4> The week just flew along, as usual.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#105:4> I have been trying to get five people together to have an oral

examination, and it is near-impossible.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#106:4> My Commonwealth students have been doing their group projects - -

one group put on pieces from a play, another got in a speaker, a 26-year-old

South African woman who grew up in Soweto and was just a wonderful speaker,

imitating herself at 18 coming out of jail and returning to school, a "

hero", racist Canadians smiling at her ( all teeth and insincerity), rolling

her eyes wonderful.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#107:4> Next week is Caribbean religion and music, so we are just rolling

along.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#108:4> I shouldn't have scheduled it all in a clump like this, but will do

better next time I teach the course, which is in May! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#109:4> I just realized that I had said I would let you know when I

could be free to stay with you after your operation if you decide to have it.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#110:4> I teach until the 31st of March, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday,

Friday.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#111:4> Tuesdays could be free if that's any use.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#112:4> I have one student who comes in every Tuesday, but she could easily

be shifted.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#113:4> Then there's Easter weekend.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#114:4> But then I am free until the 8th, i.e. the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th of

April.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#115:4> Then I have two examinations on the 8th, mark like mad on the 9th,

and depart on the 10th for Kingston, returning late on the 25th. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#116:4> I have been swimming in the pool and riding the exercise bike so

I feel most virtuous - - hardly anyone seems to use the equipment though, so

I suspect they might want to stop heating the pool.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#117:4> Oh, that reminds me, did I tell you that <@> UCAN </@> is planning

to build at least 3 highrises at the back of this property ( just near the

woods).
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#118:4> Although the signs saying highrise have been up for a while, no one

realized how big they might be ( could be 30 storeys), so I am trying to

encourage people to write protest letters to the <@> UCAN </@> Board of

Governors and the BOG of the <@> UCAN </@> Real Estate Company.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#119:4> I am glad <@> KNAO </@> was cancelled, because the woods right

across from our bedroom would likely have been where it would have sat!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#120:4> Must go,
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#121:4> love, <@> Margaret </@> </p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#122:5> <h> 25 June 1994 </h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#123:5> <h> Dear Mum, </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#124:5> First, thanks a lot for supplying the venue for <@> Hubert </@> 's

World Cup viewing.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#125:5> I realize you probably didn't have much time for interesting

conversations, but he enjoyed himself, particularly the ice cream.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#126:5> We made it to lunch on time and <@> Hubert </@> got to help <@> Cory

</@> pull up the crab trap ( 2 crabs).
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#127:5> Did I tell you <@> Cory </@> is making furniture now?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#128:5> Anyway we bought 2 garden chairs <O> drawing </O> ( like that) which

he and <@> Sara </@> are bringing over next week, probably. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-001#129:5> The really exciting news is that we <ul> sold the house </ul> ! !
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#130:5> What a relief, even though we got back a little less than we paid

and there is no point thinking about making back what we paid for the roof,

the deck, the new circuit breakers, etc. etc.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#131:5> With interest rates surging, Kingston's real estate market is also

likely to slump and mortgage rates are rising at a horrifying pace.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-001#132:5> What is truly striking is that interest paid on accounts is still at

1/4% while the prime lending rate is now 8%. </p> </I>
