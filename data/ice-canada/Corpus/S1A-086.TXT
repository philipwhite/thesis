<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#192:1:B> Some females writers
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#193:1:B> Uh <,,> <@> Webequie </@> has this huge preoccupation with death

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#194:1:A> <?> You're right </?>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#195:1:B> Almost every story coming out of uh <@> Webequie </@> uhm had

something to do with someone dying <,,> you know committing suicide or

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#196:1:A> <unclear> word </unclear> <}> <-> it's the forth </-> <=>

<{> <[> <,> like </[> at the moment

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#197:1:B> <[> Mhh hmm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#198:1:A> You know what I mean
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#199:1:A> If there's a lot of suicides in that area you're naturally going

to think about those things when you think about home

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#200:1:B> Ya
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#201:1:B> But like <,,> to me <}> <-> that's like </-> <=> that's like </=>

</}> not a very healthy indication of <,> the town
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#202:1:B> I mean <}> <-> that's </-> <=> <{1> <[1> that's </[1> </=> </}>

you know <}> <-> your </-> <=> your </=> </}> youth's major preoccupation is

death and suicides and whatnot I mean <,,> obviously <}> <-> there's </-> <=>

there's </=> </}> something wrong there
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#203:1:B> <{2> <[2> <,,> </[2> you know

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#204:1:A> <[1> No </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#205:1:A> <[2> Mhh hmm </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#206:1:B> But then we always knew there was something wrong there <{>

<[> anyhow <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#207:1:B> <?> That's why </?> we write about it </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#208:1:A> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#209:1:A> You fellas better start finding something good about <}> <-> <@>

Weben </@> </-> <=> <{> <[> <@> Webequie </@> </[> </=> </}>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#210:1:B> <[> Oh we </[> </{> do find good things about <@> Webequie

</@>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#211:1:B> We've written good things about <@> Webequie </@>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#212:1:B> I mean people just don't see that
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#213:1:B> They <{> <[> just </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#214:1:A> <[> No </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#215:1:B> Of course they hear <}> <-> all the </-> <=> all the </=>

</}> other scandalous stories <O> laugh </O> and they get <{> <[> off on that

a lot </[> more

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#216:1:A> <[> Right right </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#217:1:A> That's true

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#218:1:B> But I mean the guy is a scandal
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#219:1:B> He should just get out of there

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#220:1:A> Ya

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#221:1:B> You know <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> reason why I

think he's holding on so much is he's got a lot of <unclear> two words

</unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#222:1:B> You know like <,,> you don't hold on <}> <-> this to <.> m </.>

</-> <=> uh with </=> </}> <}> <-> such a </-> <=> <,,> such a </=> </}> grip

unless there is something there

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#223:1:A> Mhh hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#224:1:B> I mean <}> <-> it's </-> <=> it's </=> </}> kind of obvious

<{> <[> <,,> </[> when your financial statements that you hand in

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#225:1:A> <[> Ya </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#226:1:B> You're supposed to hand in your financial statements every

year
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#227:1:B> And the statements that you hand in are two years out of date

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#228:1:A> Right <{> <[> ya </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#229:1:A> <[> Then you </[> </{> refuse to give you know <}> <-> your

</-> <=> your </=> </}> holding company
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#230:1:A> Like you know how we have uh <@> Eastmain </@> Enterprises <{> <[>

and that </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#231:1:A> <[> Mhh hmm </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#232:1:B> Well could you imagine them refusing to give their annual

statements at a uh annual band meeting of everybody

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#233:1:A> No <,> I can <{> <[> see them </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#234:1:B> <[> Well </[> </{> <,> that's what they did at uh <,> <@>

Webequie </@> for Sageen

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#235:1:A> But many times those things are presented uh uh to the public

<,> and the public don't understand what they're about <{> <[> anyway </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#236:1:B> <[> Mhh hmm </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#237:1:B> But these guys refused to even bring up any numbers <{> <[> <,,>

</[> so I mean

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#238:1:A> <[> <O> cough </O> </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#239:1:B> I know the first years uh I went to the Band Council meetings

at home <,> hardly anyone ever questioned the amounts of money <}> <-> that

we were </-> <=> <,> that they were </=> </}> being asked to to pass <{> <[>

<,,> </[> to approve for whatever <,> project was going on

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#240:1:B> <[> To approve ya </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#241:1:A> That's why <,> <?> Nis'ko </?> became such ah <,,> a white

elephant in the end
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#242:1:A> I mean <{> <[> <,,> </[> you know

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#243:1:B> <[> Mhh hmm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#244:1:A> And then they <}> <-> tried </-> <=> tried </=> </}> to bury

that and you can't bury it
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#245:1:A> It's going to come up all the time <,,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#246:1:B> That's probably why you see an entire new Band Council there

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#247:1:A> It could be
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#248:1:A> It could be <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#249:1:A> But uh you don't or people seem to be afraid to speak out and say

well <,> <}> <-> that's </-> <=> uh I don't think </=> </}> you should <,>

give them any more money
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#250:1:A> Nobody wanted to <unclear> two or three words </unclear>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#251:1:B> Well <,,> the problem with that is I think <}> <-> is is </->

<=> it's </=> </}> because when you do speak out <,,> <}> <-> you get <,> you

get </-> <=> uh <,,> you get </=> </}> singled out <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#252:1:B> You know what I mean
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#253:1:B> <}> <-> And </-> <=> and </=> </}> people <,> sitting up there

that are supposed to be listening to you and looking for your <,> responses

and whatnot attack you

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#254:1:A> Mhh hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#255:1:B> And I mean <}> <-> it's </-> <=> it's </=> </}> embarrassing

to be attacked
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#256:1:B> <unclear> word </unclear> <?> hand </?>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#257:1:B> First of all they're sitting higher than you
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#258:1:B> You know like usually they're not even the same level

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#259:1:A> No and you know that they have disagreed with you that <{1>

<[1> <,> three </[1> - quarters <}> <-> of the </-> <=> of the </=> </}>

public that you're sitting with <,> will feel <,> the way that they do
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#260:1:A> <{2> <[2> <,,> </[2> because they're sitting in that position
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#261:1:A> <{3> <[3> <,,> </[3> and people come out from out of nowhere <}>

<-> and <.> a </.> </-> <=> and attack </=> </}> the system that they're you

know
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#262:1:A> <{4> <[4> <,,> </[4>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#263:1:A> <{5> <[5> <unclear> word </unclear> </[5> <,,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#264:1:B> <[1> Mhh hmm </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#265:1:B> <[2> Ya </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#266:1:B> <[3> Mhh hmm </[3> </{3>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#267:1:B> <[4> Mhh hmm </[4> </{4>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#268:1:B> <[5> It's uh </[5> </{5>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#269:1:B> <}> <-> It's </-> <=> it's </=> </}> like what they did to the

trappers
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#270:1:B> They ganged up on them and <}> <-> they </-> <=> <,> they </=>

</}> used Cree culture against them
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#271:1:B> You know their own culture and they go this is for the best of the

people the best of everybody <{> <[> <,> </[> and you're the one holding it

up you're the one causing the problems you know

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#272:1:A> <[> Ya </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#273:1:B> And Cree way of life is sharing and cooperation everything

else
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#274:1:B> And so they're saying you're going against that when you're

actually living the traditional <{> <[> life <,,> </[> and they're not

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#275:1:A> <[> Right right </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-086#276:1:A> Ya

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#277:1:B> You know <,,> they're the ones <,> forcing you into that

thing

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#278:1:A> Ya yup

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#279:1:B> And that's what I feel is wrong <,,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-086#280:1:A> Yup I do too </I>
