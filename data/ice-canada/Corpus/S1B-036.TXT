<ICE-CAN:S1B-036#1:1> If your kids are bigger than that <,> you know that won't work and uhm

<,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-036#2:1:A> <}> <-> The </-> <=> the </=> </}> hardest thing I found I

remember we used to get questions about this and I never realized what a

problem it was <,> is for boys and I imagine for girls but I'm the mother of

boys <,> who reach a certain age where their size is bigger than their age
<ICE-CAN:S1B-036#3:1:A> <}> <-> My </-> <=> My </=> </}> older son is only ten <,> but he's

already five feet tall wears a size seven men's shoe and he's not a man he's

a <{> <[> little </[> boy

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-036#4:1:B> <[> Right </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-036#5:1:B> It's worse for girls actually

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-036#6:1:A> { > <[> Oh really </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-036#7:1:B> <[> For guys </[> </{> you really can get away with <,> putting

them in a man's pants putting them in a man's running suit it's not going to

make a difference
<ICE-CAN:S1B-036#8:1:B> When you take a little <,> girl and you try and put her in a <w>

ladies' </w> size five or seven it <}> <-> ain't </-> <+> isn't </+> </}> <}>

<-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> work because she's a different shape
<ICE-CAN:S1B-036#9:1:B> So it's <{> <[> much harder </[> for the girls and there's less to

buy cos again you want them to look like a little girl but the <w> ladies'

</w> stuff is <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> be much too mature

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-036#10:1:A> <[> That's true </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-036#11:1:B> So you're really lucky that you have boys
<ICE-CAN:S1B-036#12:1:B> Uhm <}> <-> it's </-> <=> it's </=> </}> sort of easier yeah
<ICE-CAN:S1B-036#13:1:B> And the men's shoes <,> you still can get a boot you know <}> <->

that </-> <=> that </=> </}> looks good on him a slip on a tie shoe that's

<[> so </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-036#14:1:A> <[> Can </[> </{> you get running shoes for example most of

periodically </+> </}> </-> <=> once a year </=> </}> they wear loafers uh

can you get running shoes <}> <-> at </-> <=> at </=> </}> the cheap price

sixty-nine dollars and <,> you know if you transfer that into a U S price and

<,> you're not going to get much in the U S for forty bucks <,,> in a running

shoe
<ICE-CAN:S1B-036#20:1:B> So you're almost in the same price range
