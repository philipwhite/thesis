     since the fall of 1988.   Doug MacDougall      mature from a very intriguing and  interesting adolescent to an equally fascinating yet productive and mature  young adult.    possesses a depth of character that is most  refreshing.  His artwork, his humour and his ease with conversation are all strong  indicators of the depth and richness of his character.    as a diligent student with a  work ethic that many could learn from.  He has also consistently shown himself as a person with great  sensitivity and compassion for all those he meets.  I fully expect the post secondary milieu will be a place where he can  truly flourish.    's teenage years have provided him with the  opportunity for travel, unique learning situations and a number of work  settings.    I wish him the best and offer him God's blessings in whatever he  takes on as his next challenge.

Enjoy yourself!!!          I am writing this letter in order that you can bring the concerns  of the United Church's  before your Annual General Meeting  or equivalent of your Pastoral Charge / Congregation and respond to the camp  before February 28th, 1995.    The camp has many reasons to celebrate: There is a small but very  dedicated core of people who love the camp and passionately believe in its  mission; the physical property retains its beauty and has been augmented by  successful building projects in the last four years; the camp has a healthy  stable of horses; investment in youth leadership has produced an enthusiastic  group of junior counsellors; this is one of the few tangible ways our church  reaches out to youth and children; the committee has an openness to God's  voice and is ready to consider change in the future.    The camp also has real concerns: The camp committee members are  few in number and very tired, the physical distance and other challenges have  contributed to a lack of a real sense of ownership on behalf of the  congregations and outreach ministries of   Regional  Presbyteries; Congregations are not supporting the camp!  The camp has had operating deficits during the last few years and is  drawing upon accumulated funds from logging revenue that was marked for  capital improvements and also appears to have been exhausted as a resource.     The camp wants to provide you with an opportunity to make your  feelings and willingness to support the camp known.  As such, we ask that you bring the attached questionnaire before your  Annual General Meeting and reply to the camp before February 28th, 1996.  Please take time to consider the letter before that date and if you  are in need of clarification contact myself or the Camp President, Ms.   Lynn Stone    IF YOU DO NOT RESPOND, WE WILL BE FORCED TO ASSUME THAT YOU HAVE  NO PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE MINISTRY OF THE CAMP.  Please take this request seriously.  Please take time to strategize, perhaps including the questionnaire  in your annual report so that your response is both considered and helpful.     Presbytery  delegate to the committee        and   will be married this forthcoming summer in a Roman  Catholic service in New Brunswick.    We are very pleased to hear of the celebrations planned and  delight with them in the occasion.    is a member in good standing of the United  Church of Canada and we support him in his freedom to be married in whatever  church he and    May God be with them in the day of celebration and long years of  matrimony to follow.          I am sorry I didn't find you in the office when I phoned about a  month ago.  You were away doing a training event for ministry of supervision.  Again, I want to affirm your calling to that all important ministry,  I often reflect on your great help to me.   and a personal letter from  .  's death.  You might recall that we spent some wonderful time with him and have  kept in touch regularly ever since.  family.  I'd like to share some thoughts with you that I trust you find an  appropriate way to share with the congregation ... many of whom, no doubt,  are new since my time there.    There was a movie out a few years ago called " Six Degrees of  Separation."  The title comes from a theory that everyone on the globe is connected  by " six degrees."  Put another way, everyone in the world is at least a friend of a  friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend.  I found this to be the most comforting of ideas ... it somehow makes  the world seem smaller, more friendly and caring.   congregation, even as I am involved in a part of the world far away both  geographically and in many other ways.  I like to think this letter as being something that will bring each  of us closer to our " neighbours."    I wanted to talk to you about The Healing Fund, the fund our  church is building to help address the profound hurt that is the unfortunate  legacy of the Residential School system in which our church participated.  While some of the Roman Catholic legacy around such schools is all   well known, our own United Church  participation has been less well documented.

Some good print resources that are nicely laid out and to the point  are also available.    ...  a traditional  village in northern B.C. along the highway  from Prince George to Prince Rupert near the larger community of   Middleton  , B.C.  Many of the people who I work with are in need of the healing that  this fund is hoping to support.    Yes, many folks were able to get an education that they may not  have otherwise had and some were taken away from homes that were quite  threatening.  But everyone who attended those schools was deprived of learning  their own culture and language and of having any reason to value their own  traditions.  And while not all suffered the atrocities of physical and sexual  abuse that are now coming to light, the honest truth is that such things were  not uncommon.  The people spoken of in the material put out by the church are the  people I work and minister with each day.    This year is the tenth anniversary of the apology to First  Nations made by our church.  I like to think that every step of the ministry that I do is taken  with that apology in mind.  As such, finding a role in the healing journey of those who went to  the schools and their children and even their children's children is part of  my everyday life.  In short, residential schools were not great places for learning  parenting skills and that impacts on the communities now.    Money doesn't heal but the programs being created to facilitate  that healing cost money.    I recognize that there are many pressures on limited financial  resources of each individual and that substantial support may not be possible  for all.  If that is the case, rest assured that your attention to and prayers  for the work going on here and throughout many other First Nations  communities is also of great value.      P.S. Feel free to make use of this letter in which ever way you  choose: simple encouragement, read as a " minute for mission", a bulletin  insert, include in the newsletter or whatever helps you do what you are  trying to do.         Welch   to our community.  Those who were able to meet with him were very thankful for the  opportunity.  He was entertaining, informative and passionate about his teaching.     As convener of the Pastoral Care Committee, I have been asked to  write a letter to formally acknowledge the work done by both you and  Dora   here and in promoting his workshops in  the community.    The pastoral care committee well recognizes the benefits of a  hospice society.  However there are two blocks in the path to the formation of one in   .  house system and some  initiatives of the Health Authority already meet many of these needs for a  great portion of the community.  The other is that in spite of a number of people who have shown an  interest to date, interestingly an overwhelming number from the Seventh Day  Adventist Church, we have not had many people with particular gifts of  administration step forward with the time or inclination to do the ground  work of forming a society or the ongoing administrative work of matching  volunteers with those who could use services.
