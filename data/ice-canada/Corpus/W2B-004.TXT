<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#1:1> <h> BRAVE NEW BALLET: ideas and athleticism shape an exciting work

</h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-004#2:1> New York City-born choreographer William Forsythe says that

nothing would surprise him more in life than <quote> " no surprises."

</quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#3:1> And when the National Ballet of Canada presented the world premiere of

his 25-minute work " the second detail" in Toronto last week, the surprises

exploded in rapid succession.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#4:1> The uniformly grey set, designed by Forsythe, was reminiscent of a

rehearsal hall - but at one point, snow began falling inside it.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#5:1> High above the grey-clad <w> dancers' </w> heads, a filmy white dress

remained suspended in the air, <?> attainable </?> as a cloud, throughout the

piece.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#6:1> Meanwhile, the choreography, both cerebral and daringly athletic,

provided surprises of its own.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#7:1> Now 42 and the artistic director of Germany's Frankfurt Ballet,

Forsythe has been hailed by critics as one of the most original interpreters

of classical dance since George Balanchine, the Russian-born master of the

mid-20th century. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-004#8:1> Forsythe's decision to create a work for the National was a major

honor for the Toronto-based company - and a welcome respite from the

recessionary gloom that has been gathering around the troupe in recent

months.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#9:1> Earlier this year, artistic director Reid Anderson announced that as a

cost-cutting measure, he would not renew the contracts of five company

members, among them two principal dancers.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#10:1> The company also cancelled plans to produce three ballets for a 1991

Mozart festival in Toronto.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#11:1> National Ballet officials predict that, even with those cuts, the

company's accumulated deficit will mount to &dollar;2 million by the end of

the 1991-1992 season, up from the current &dollar;1.6 million. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-004#12:1> Still, at last week's opening, the performers looked strong and

adventurous.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#13:1> Forsythe's distinctive vocabulary of angular, ferociously swift

movements is already familiar to the company's dancers - his 1985 work,

Steptext, entered the National's repertoire in 1989.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#14:1> Like Steptext, the second detail applies a <unclear> one word

</unclear> , risk-taking freedom to the diamond-hard precision of classical

dance.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#15:1> Forsythe, who used to dance the classics in New York's Joffrey

Ballet, told Maclean's: <quote> " A lot of my stuff doesn't look like ballet,

but only ballet dancers could do it." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-004#16:1> In person, the lanky, freckled choreographer is a mixture of

bubbly humor and intellectual adventurousness.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#17:1> His enthusiasms range from dancing in the rap music videos ( <quote> "

M. C. Hammer is the greatest" </quote> ) to French deconstructionist Michel

Foucault's Archeology of Knowledge ( <quote> " a really groovy book" </quote> ) .
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#18:1> The eclectic nature of his creativity is readily apparent in " the

second detail".
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#19:1> For several minutes, a film of icebergs, underwear and other random

images is projected onto a blank wall, competing with the dancers for

attention.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#20:1> The effect is distracting - but ultimately stimulating.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#21:1> For everyone involved, a Forsythe ballet is an exhilarating workout.

<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#22:2> <h> EXISTENTIAL ACROBATICS: Robert Desrosiers choreographs a life

</h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-004#23:2> The best-known works of Toronto-based choreographer Robert

Desrosiers have unfolded in a strange and spectacular dream world - a place

where athletic dancers in elaborate, unearthly costumes cavort among the

special effects.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#24:2> In Blue Snake, the choreographer's 1985 commission for the National

Ballet of Canada, a 30-foot-high giant's head gobbles up zebra-suited

dancers.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#25:2> Incognito, which the artist created for the 1988 Calgary Winter

Olympics arts festival and revised in 1989, combines surreal imagery with

high-tech trickery.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#26:2> By comparison, his latest work for his own company is a surprisingly

straightforward piece.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#27:2> The <?> hour </?> Jeux ( Games), which debuted last week at Toronto's

Premiere Dance Theatre, is about the phases of human life from conception to

the grave.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#28:2> It is a production in which dance rather than spectacle is dominant.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#29:2> Unfortunately, the absence of spectacle is all too conspicuous: on

its own, Desrosiers's choreography proves to be only intermittently

interesting. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-004#30:2> Described by its 37-year-old choreographer as <quote> " a

portrayal of the cyclical nature of our lives," </quote> Jeux begins with two

lovers conceiving a child on a billowing sheet.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#31:2> In an inventive scene change, the sheet becomes the wall of a womb,

revealing Desrosiers as the fetus within.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#32:2> He bursts through the sheet, simulating birth.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#33:2> In the rest of the first act, members of the Premiere Dance Theatre

and guest artists from the Canadian Children's Dance Theatre portray

successive stages of life.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#34:2> For most of Jeux's second act, titled <quote> " Life Carnival,"

</quote> the narrative disappears and the relationships among the dancers

become abstract.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#35:2> At the end, an old man totters onto the stage and dies, completing

the life cycle. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-004#36:2> Desrosiers's choreography is dynamic, and his dancers are, for

the most part, equal to the punishingly acrobatic demands that he places on

them.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#37:2> But he relies heavily on a fairly limited range of swirling, churning

movements that eventually seem repetitive.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#38:2> Jeux's other major weakness is that the first and second acts bear

little relation to each other; the finale with the old man seems <unclear>

one word </unclear> on and fails to draw the two halves together.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#39:2> Like the wizard of Oz, Robert Desrosiers looks disconcertingly human

when he emerges from his arsenal of special effects. </p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#40:3> <h> Eloquent ambiguity </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-004#41:3> When Joanne Tod was a student at the Ontario College of Art in

the early 1970s, painting was a decidedly unfashionable activity.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#42:3> Making art with a video camera, or by arranging rocks on a gallery

floor - that was fashionable.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#43:3> And for those who felt compelled to paint, there was always abstract

art.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#44:3> But in her large canvases, which often addressed thorny social

issues, Tod persisted in depicting subjects realistically.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#45:3> Since the 1970s, such figurative painting has made a comeback - and

Tod, now 38, is one of its most celebrated Canadian practitioners.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#46:3> A major exhibition of her work opened recently at Toronto's Power

Plant gallery, where it will be on view until Aug. 25.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#47:3> It then travels to Saskatoon's Mendel Art Gallery ( Sept. 20 to Nov.

3), the co-organizer of the show with the Power Plant, and to the Winnipeg

Art Gallery ( Nov. 29 to Feb. 16).
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#48:3> The artist says that she does not regret having been out of step in

art school.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#49:3> <quote> " It was a good experience because it put me in a position to

be contrary," </quote> said Tod. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#X50:3> <quote> " I find it really interesting to put myself in opposition

to other things." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-004#51:3> What is clear from the show, which features 20 large paintings

from the past decade, is that Tod's work simmers with opposition to sexism,

racism and absolutist thinking.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#52:3> Those topics have led many other artists into the mire of diatribe.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#53:3> But Tod has confronted such issues with engaging originality and, on

occasion, mordant humor.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#54:3> Institutions including the National Gallery of Canada and the

Vancouver Art Gallery have acquired her work.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#55:3> And now she is starting to gain recognition abroad: in the fall, some

of her paintings, which currently sell for between &dollar;15,000 and

&dollar;35,000 each, will be part of a group show at the Thaddaeus Ropac

Gallery in Paris.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#56:3> Said Mendel curator Bruce Grenville, who put together the current

show: <quote> " Anyone can be a flash in the pan, but Joanne has been

producing very strong, articulate work for 10 years." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-004#57:3> A vibrant, affable woman who rode her bicycle to a recent

interview with Maclean's, Tod recalled that she began drawing and painting

during her childhood.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#58:3> Raised in Mississauga, Ont., she was the only child of computer

technician Andrew Tod and his homemaker wife, Georgina Tod.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#59:3> After graduating from the Ontario College of Art in 1974, Tod worked

as an assistant in a private gallery for a number of years.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#60:3> But since 1982, she has been able to devote herself to painting full

time.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#61:3> The artist now lives in downtown Toronto with Bob Becker, a musician

with the award-winning percussion group Nexus. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-004#62:3> While Tod's work has become more complex and less direct over the

past decade, one constant has been her use of photographs as the basis for

her paintings.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#63:3> Self Portrait, a 1982 canvas that is perhaps her best-known work, is

derived from a 1940s advertisement showing an elegant, formally gowned woman

posing on a flight of steps beneath a night sky.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#64:3> Calling the glamorous figure a self-portrait appears to be a simple

act of fantasizing - except for one thing.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#65:3> In yellow letters printed over the figure's dress are the words

<quote> " <}> <-> <w> 'neath </w> </-> <+> beneath </+> </}> my arm is the

color of Russell's Subaru." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#66:3> That prosaic stray thought - it refers to the shade of a friend's car

- stomps across the dreamy vision, challenging its outdated conception of

ideal womanhood without entirely cancelling out the image's nostalgically

romantic allure. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-004#67:3> In 1983, Tod turned that painting into a picture within a picture

with Self Portrait as Prostitute.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#68:3> In the latter work, the earlier painting hangs on the wall of a

tasteful dining room.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#69:3> Clearly, the original work has become a commodity, something to be

consumed along with dinner.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#70:3> Tod now says that at that point in her career, she worried whether

the need to sell paintings would cause her to compromise her work.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#71:3> But since then, she adds, she has learned from feminism that <quote>

" it's in my best interest to have the financial autonomy that selling

paintings makes possible.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#72:3> I haven't had to take jobs that would take away from my painting

time.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#73:3> As a result, I think my product has improved." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-004#74:3> By the mid-1980s, Tod was dealing with race-related questions in

her work.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#75:3> The 1984 canvas A Diamond Is Forever shows a well-dressed elderly

couple evidently posing for the camera in their own upper-class home - the

woman's hand rests on a table in a proprietary fashion.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#76:3> The picture would be a typical society portrait, except that the

couple is black.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#77:3> And that unexpected element forces viewers to confront their

preconceptions about who belongs where in society. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-004#78:3> For several years, Tod has been combining disparate, often

perplexing images in her work, which on the whole has become more <unclear>

one word </unclear> .
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#79:3> Tod says that Purple Heart, a massive ( 10 feet by 15 feet) 1989

composition, was inspired by the massacre in Beijing's Tiananmen Square two

years ago.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#80:3> In the painting, a pair of intricately carved Chinese panels frame a

close-up of two traditionally decorated Chinese vases.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#81:3> Incongruously, a vertical row of chevrons painted in a flat, abstract

style bridges a gap between the two vases.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#82:3> And diagonal smears of magenta paint deface the side panels. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-004#83:3> Like much of Tod's work, the painting is a highly personal

response to a larger event.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#84:3> Said Tod, with reference to the smears: <quote> " Something that

struck me was a news report about students throwing cans of paint at the

official portraits of Mao." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#85:3> She added that among her own early works had been a series of

idealized Mao portraits.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#86:3> The smears also recall the work of American abstract painter Morris

Louis, while the chevrons allude to a shape repeatedly used by another,

Kenneth Noland.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#87:3> <quote> " In referring to those painters, I was referring back to my

own education, and to when I made those Mao paintings with all this hope and

idealism," </quote> said the artist.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#88:3> She noted that the combination of the chevrons and the smears in

Purple Heart also suggested a spinal column and a rib cage: <quote> " It

anthropomorphizes the image and puts it back to the real thing that happened

there - mass killing." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-004#89:3> While it was Tod's contempt for a repressive political regime

that inspired Purple Heart, she opposes absolutism in all of its lesser

guises as well.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#90:3> In particular, she balks at the kind of art that screams out its

message without allowing any room for dissent or ambiguity.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#91:3> <quote> " I have gone through a really vehement political phase,"

</quote> she said, <quote> " but I never felt I was trying to be didactic in

the sense of saying <quote> 'This is how I feel and this is what is right and

this is what you should feel, too.' </quote> " </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#92:3> Combining passionate commitment and a questioning intelligence,

Joanne Tod has a knack for probing unsettling issues. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#93:4> <h> A DECADE THAT ROARED: a Montreal show explores the manic 1920s

</h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-004#94:4> Perhaps more than any decade this century, the 1920s were years

of social flux and artistic frenzy.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#95:4> The desolation of the First World War gave way to the machine age -

and an acceleration in all aspects of life.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#96:4> It was the era of sprouting skyscrapers and Charles Lindberg's

historic transatlantic flight.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#97:4> In the smoke-filled cabarets of Berlin, the crowded cafes of Paris

and the steamy nightclubs of New York City, there was a frantic burst of

creative energy.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-004#98:4> A number of artists provided glimpses of the technological furture:

German film-maker Fritz Lang's Metropolis ( 1926) and French painter Fernand

Leger's industrial paintings visualized the <quote> " robot," </quote> a word

coined in 1921. </p> </I>
