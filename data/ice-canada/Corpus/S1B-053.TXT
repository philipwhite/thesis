<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#3:1:A> In Matsqui prison in B C today is another repeat offender who has

been ordered deported nine times
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#4:1:A> Does the minister intend to deport this rapist nine times as well

because the gory details day in and day out Mister Speaker give no

satisfaction and no pleasure to any member on this side as it doesn't give

any pleasure and satisfaction to that side Mister Speaker
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#9:1:B> We have laws
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#10:1:B> We also have a process
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#11:1:B> We also move to deport individuals and we have
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#12:1:B> And we will further strengthen that
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#13:1:B> I will give a commitment to look into those individual cases but

<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#16:1:A> While at the present time <,> we are waiting for results from

different consultation processes and studies I'd like to offer the minister

the chance to show Canadians his bite is as big as his bark as he has

previously claimed <&> audience laughter </&>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#17:1:A> The hearing for the once deported rapist my colleague referred to

will be held at eight thirty A M tomorrow morning

individual and guarantee Canadians that he will never <,> ever enter Canada

that excitement can <}> <-> in <.> f </.> in </-> <=> in fact </=> </}> throw

the case out because he and other members could be in contempt of court

<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#23:1:B> Why don't you
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#24:1:B> Firstly why don't you settle down
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#25:1:B> Maybe you should settle down firstly
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#26:1:B> And secondly <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#27:1:B> Secondly if we do have the case at heart and we want to create

think documentation for a number of individuals is impossible if in fact they

documentation sometimes is an impossibility which is taken into account

<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#43:1:G> My question is for the Minister of Justice
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#44:1:G> We have been told that law abiding firearms owners are the primary

source of guns <,> used in crime because their firearms can be stolen
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#45:1:G> Accurate information regarding the sources of guns for criminals is

necessary to determine if further firearms controls will reduce gun related

crime yet the statistics are unavailable
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#46:1:G> Mister Speaker will the minister undertake <,> a comprehensive

national study to determine the source of firearms for criminal activities

and will he make the information readily available to all Canadians <&>

<$I> <ICE-CAN:S1B-053#54:1:I> <unclear> word </unclear> Speaker
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#55:1:I> Uh Mister Speaker my question is for the Minister of Transport
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#56:1:I> Recently the minister gave an address uh outlining the government's

plans to systematically dismantle the transportation system in this country

and it should have been entitled Goodbye to the National Dream
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#57:1:I> Mister Speaker the minister calls his plan <mention>

commercialization </mention> but it is clear that he means <mention>

privatization </mention> and will affect seventy-five per cent of the

department's activities
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#58:1:I> And I want to ask the minister to be clear <,> with Canadians
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#59:1:I> His policy clearly follows the Tory Royal Commission on transport
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#60:1:I> And I'd like to ask the minister to explain how his plan to

commercialize is different from the Tory's plan to privatize which he opposed

so vehemently in the last Parliament

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-053#61:1:C> The honourable Minister of Transport

<$E> <ICE-CAN:S1B-053#62:1:E> Yes uh Mister Speaker <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> want to

assure uh my honourable colleague that there is no intention to dismantle the

transportation system
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#63:1:E> What in fact we're trying to do Mister Speaker is to ensure that

there is an integrated affordable transportation system available to

Canadians to <}> <-> move </-> <=> move </=> </}> both people and products
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#64:1:E> But I want to say to my honourable colleague that uh many uh people

who follow the transportation scene will recognize uh in the

commercialization approach that we are trying to maintain the Government of

Canada's involvement in a supervisory a regulatory <}> <-> a </-> <=> a </=>

</}> policy uh way uh uh <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> work that we're

doing in transportation but we also understand that we have to have business

and commercial practices applied to the way we do administer the

transportation system
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#65:1:E> Mister Speaker the people who've been around <}> <-> <.> ha </.>

</-> <=> have </=> </}> seen former uh ministers of transport uh uh <}> <->

of a </-> <=> of a </=> </}> Liberal stripe attempt to do these kinds of

things
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#66:1:E> It is not a Tory agenda
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#67:1:E> It's an agenda designed to provide Canada with a transportation

system that will support the economy that's required to pay for the social

programs that are at the heart of Liberal policy <&> applause </&> <,,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-053#76:2:B> Madam Speaker I've been working on amendments to the Young

Offenders Act since the day I was elected
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#77:2:B> I want to share with my colleage across because some of the things

that I have heard just certainly I could not comprehend
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#78:2:B> <}> <-> The <,> the </-> <=> This </=> </}> particular act that

we're dealing with right now was first tested in nineteen eighty-five when a

young individual in my riding <,> killed uh three people a mother a father

and a seven-year old uh <,> daughter
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#79:2:B> This young offender received in total three years
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#80:2:B> My constituents were just just just <,> could
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#81:2:B> There were no words to describe their feelings
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#82:2:B> What I'm hearing from the honourable member is that the Liberal

</=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#83:2:B> Madam Speaker I don't think the Liberal Party brought <}> <-> this

Act
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#85:2:B> And certainly I disagree with my colleague is saying

<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#87:2:B> Well this young individual that snuffed <,> snuffed Madam Speaker

three lives <,> he was not an adolescent
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#88:2:B> He had moved already <,> into that particular world which is called

an adult
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#89:2:B> He committed a crime <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#90:2:B> There's a saying that says <,> <quote> you do the crime you pay the

<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#91:2:B> Now <,> I've heard with great interest <}> <-> the Speaker the the

<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#92:2:B> But the one question that I have for the honurable member is the

following
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#93:2:B> What in her view <,,> should <,> a young offender get <,> when that

individual <,> commits a severe crime such as <,> a killing <,,> or a rape

we <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> say to that adolescent you did

<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#95:2:B> <}> <-> More </-> <=> <,> More </=> </}> at home Madam Speaker if a

young offender were to kill a member of her family what would the honourable

<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#102:2:D> Uhm uh my colleague in her speech mentioned that the preamble uh

of the amendments to the Young Offenders Act falls very short and I would

just like her to comment what does my colleague from Quebec say about what

should be the balance between uh victim's needs and offender's needs uh as

outlined uh in the preamble as to the general direction as to where the act

uh should be administered
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#103:2:D> I notice that uhm the word <mention> victim </mention> I don't

believe is not mentioned at all in the preamble and I would like her views on

support of the government's recent actions <,> <O> cough </O> to crack down

on violent young offenders who commit serious crimes
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#112:2:F> Madam Speaker I'd like to uh sort of preambulate my speech by

saying that we all have responsibilities in this country of Canada that we

shouldn't predicate <,> the effectiveness of programs uhm on what our <}> <->

<.> p </.> </-> <=> political </=> </}> agendas are
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#113:2:F> I think we have a responsibility for the young people of this

to address the needs that are there
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#114:2:F> Uhm I must say that I'm happy to be a member of Parliament and a

contributing member so to speak <,> that will perhaps add to a healthy debate

<,> and makes viable suggestions <,> that would <,> fortify the country bring

people together and to carve out a future for young people in this country

rather than to talk about some rather destructive means uh that uhm would <,>

not bring any enjoyment or any good health to the country such as it is
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#115:2:F> I'm pleased uh uh on June the second the Minister of Justice

tabled amendments to the Young Offenders Act
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#116:2:F> These amendments recognize the public's growing concern about <,>

youth violence and demonstrate the priority this government places on

protecting the public
<ICE-CAN:S1B-053#117:2:F> These amendments uh by shifting the onus on young people to take

responsibility for their violent crimes sends a strong signal <,> to young

people that their actions carry serious consequences </I>
