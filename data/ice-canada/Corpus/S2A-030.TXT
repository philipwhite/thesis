<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#1:1:A> When the person who paid for the painting is actually part of

painting itself
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#2:1:A> Does anybody have any questions
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#3:1:A> Mhh hmm <X>

<$ZH> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X4:1:Z> <O> Question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X5:1:A> The red
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X6:1:A> <}> <-> <.> Wha </.> </-> <+> what </+> </}>

<$ZH> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X7:1:Z> <O> Clarifies question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X8:1:A> Ya it's just part of the throne <,> and it links it to Mary

</X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#9:1:A> So but if we think of the colour red or blue and if we think of how

people <,> uhm got paint those days
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#10:1:A> You know they obviously didn't buy it at their local art stores
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#11:1:A> Where would they have gotten the colours to grind <,> in for the

pigments <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#12:1:A> What would those come from

<$ZI> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#13:1:Z> <O> Answer </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#14:1:Z> Ya they would often come from fruits or vegetables and dyes but the

ones that were to last really long would also be <,> from rocks and minerals
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#15:1:Z> Right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#16:1:Z> Have you seen very many <}> <-> rock </-> <=> red or blue rocks

</=> </}> in your lifetime
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#17:1:Z> No
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#18:1:Z> They're among the most <,> rare pigments
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#19:1:Z> So it would make sense <}> <-> when they </-> <=> when they're </=>

</}> making paintings like this that they're going to reserve these more <,>

rare colours for the things that have the most important part of the painting

themselves
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#20:1:Z> So <,> we'll see these colours again in the painting ah soon
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#21:1:Z> Any other questions
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#22:1:Z> Mhh hmm <X>

<$ZJ> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X23:1:Z> <O> Question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X24:1:A> Okay I'll show you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X25:1:A> It's uh just right up here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X26:1:A> It's kind of scratched in the painting itself
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X27:1:A> So as we ah go to the next room you can take a closer look <,> at

it </X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#28:1:A> Any other questions
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#29:1:A> No
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#30:1:A> Okay <&> Tape cuts out </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#31:1:A> Just going to explain a little bit about how the lighting

system works <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#32:1:A> Uhm we're actually going to go though this way
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#33:1:A> Uh you can see that these <,> skylights <}> <-> open up directly to

the to the </-> well <=> allows <}> <-> them </-> <=> the </=> </}> light to

come directly into these galleries </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#34:1:A> So <,> those blinds underneath the skylights just are uhm connected

to a computer that <,> limits the amount of light that comes in
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#35:1:A> So if all of a sudden it gets sunny then the blinds will close

quite a bit
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#36:1:A> Uh so it's all regulated very specifically
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#37:1:A> As we walk through here you're going to see circular windows
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#38:1:A> The same type of skylight <,> exists on the other side of this wall

only in this case it's to allow the natural lighting to go all the way down

to the Canadian galleries underneath us
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#39:1:A> So that's what we're going to be seeing through these windows <&>

Tape cuts out </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#40:1:A> So I'll begin by talking about the price of this painting
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#41:1:A> Not because I think that the price of any <,> painting is of

particular significance but I can hear you all talking about it and the first

question I was asked was how much is it worth <,> and I believe it's worth

about four million dollars
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#42:1:A> How much we paid for it uh the National Gallery paid one point

seven eight million for it <,> a few years ago
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#43:1:A> And it was pretty much the purchase of the painting ah that

received a lot of attention because this painting was hanging in this room

for a couple of years before and nobody took much notice of it and then uh

the Gallery finally bought it and of course it meant for probably the first

time in the history of Canada uh people were actually talking about art
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#44:1:A> So uhm I'll <,> discuss a little bit why this painting has the

market value that it does and then after that I'd be glad to answer any

questions that you have about that particular aspect of it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#45:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#46:1:A> So Barnett Newman <,> is the name of the artist
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#47:1:A> He is an American artist
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#48:1:A> He was born in nineteen oh two
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#49:1:A> He painted this in nineteen sixty-seven
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#50:1:A> So how old was he then <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#51:1:A> Sixty-five years old at the time
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#52:1:A> He died three years later <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#53:1:A> And uh today in nineteen ninety-five he's considered to be probably

uh the most important artist since the Second World War
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#54:1:A> He only did about a hundred and thirty-five works of art in his

lifetime
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#55:1:A> And so you can imagine that there are many art galleries like this

one <,> whose mandate it is to collect art that's considered important in its

time that want to collect works by him and others who worked uh in New York

around the same time
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#56:1:A> So <,,> does that answer your question about the market value

itself
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#57:1:A> You know supply demand <,> uhm
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#58:1:A> Just like a pair of Nike running shoes or a hockey player
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#59:1:A> Right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#60:1:A> It just depends on what people want to spend
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#61:1:A> How many have that talent or how many are <}> <-> <.> th </.> </->

<=> there </=> </}> in the world and it drives the price <,> up
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#62:1:A> Alright <X>

<$ZK> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X63:1:Z> <O> Answer </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X64:1:A> So ya </X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#65:1:A> That <,> moves us to stage two
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#66:1:A> You are probably wondering why this painting <&> Suspected speakers

not recorded </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#67:1:A> You guys just want to listen at the back <,> for a minute
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#68:1:A> I'm trying to explain it to you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#69:1:A> You might be wondering why uhm this very simple looking painting

<,> is considered so important
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#70:1:A> Right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#71:1:A> Or why the artist who painted it is considered so important
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#72:1:A> It looks so simple
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#73:1:A> Anybody could do it <,> blah blah blah <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#74:1:A> Right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#75:1:A> Okay <,> ehm so what I'll do is I'll take you back further than

nineteen sixty-seven
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#76:1:A> I'll take you back to nineteen fifty-one or nineteen fifty-two when

that little painting over there was painted
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#77:1:A> Can you imagine living in that time and seeing a painting like that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#78:1:A> How do you think that was received <,,> by the public <X>

<$ZL> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X79:1:Z> <O> Answer </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X80:1:A> Pardon me

<$ZL> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X81:1:Z> <O> Answer </O>

<$ZM> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X82:1:Z> <O> Answer </O> </X>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#83:1:A> Boring <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#84:1:A> What comments do you think people would have made

<$ZL> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#85:1:Z> <O> Answer </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#86:1:A> Plain
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#87:1:A> I could do it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#88:1:A> My grandchild could do it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#89:1:A> Right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#90:1:A> Things like that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#91:1:A> Depending on how old we are my little brother et cetera
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#92:1:A> So we have to wonder why an artist forty years ago or fifty years

ago would decide to put such a simple painting <,> in the world
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#93:1:A> Right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#94:1:A> I mean <,> <}> <-> he obviously </-> <=> uh he didn't get very much

</=> </}> <,,> or he didn't have very much support from even other artists
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#95:1:A> Jackson Pollock whose work is over there was about the only artist

that supported him
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#96:1:A> I won't give you too much of a sob story of the starving artist but

apparently he actually did have to sell things that he owned to put <,> <}>

<-> art </-> <=> food </=> </}> on the table <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#97:1:A> So why did he do these simple simple paintings
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#98:1:A> One of the reasons was <,> he wanted his paintings to be for

everybody
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#99:1:A> So if we think of <,> how a painting can be for everybody then we

will not ask in front of a painting like this <,> what does it represent in

the same way that we would ask that question in the painting that I just

showed you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#100:1:A> Right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#101:1:A> And I very uhm you know uh gradually told you what the other

painting represented
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#102:1:A> The cow <,> or the pig represented this or the uhm pineapple

represented that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#103:1:A> So every object had this specific <,> meaning that was hidden from

us as twentieth century <,> ah Canadians let's say
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#104:1:A> It was really made for fourteenth century Flemish Christians the

last painting
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#105:1:A> This painting <,> we're not <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+>

</}> look at the meanings behind it but in fact we are actually going to look

at the painting
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#106:1:A> And that difference <,> is really I think <}> <-> the </-> <=> the

</=> </}> most crucial thing <}> <-> to </-> <=> to </=> </}> realize when we

look at this painting
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#107:1:A> So <,> what I'm going to suggest is that we actually look at this

in a very specific way
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#108:1:A> I'm going to give you instructions to look at this painting
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#109:1:A> <}> <-> Does it </-> <=> do you </=> </}> mind doing that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#110:1:A> I do it just to save a bit of time <}> <-> in and I </-> <=> you

know we </=> </}> want to see Van Gogh and other things as well
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#111:1:A> So would you mind following my instructions for a couple of

minutes <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#112:1:A> <}> <-> <.> Kay </.> </-> <+> okay </+> </}> I promise you I won't

make you look at the painting for longer than two minutes
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#113:1:A> <}> <-> <.> Kay </.> </-> <+> okay </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#114:1:A> Could I borrow somebody's watch to ensure that <,> I'll only make

you look at it for two minutes
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#115:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#116:1:A> Whatever <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#117:1:A> <O> laugh </O> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#118:1:A> I'm timing you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#119:1:A> I would like you to look at the blue stripe on your right hand

side <,> for the entire two minutes
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#120:1:A> So we'll start <X>

<$ZN> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X121:1:Z> <O> interrupts </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X122:1:A> That's okay </X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#123:1:A> No no I'll just look at it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#124:1:A> So we will start now <&> Tape cuts out </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#125:1:A> We'll just focus our eyes all that time just on the blue to the

right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#126:1:A> The red's <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> try to creep

in a bit but just keep refocusing on the blue <&> Tape cuts out </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#127:1:A> <}> <-> <.> Kay </.> </-> <+> okay </+> </}> one minute has gone

by so we'll look at it for another minute <&> Tape cuts out </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#128:1:A> There are thirty seconds left
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#129:1:A> They're <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> most crucial thirty

seconds <,,> <&> Tape cuts out </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#130:1:A> So what happens to the blues <&> Multiple audience members

respond. Speaker A engages their thoughts </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#131:1:A> Is anybody still looking at the painting
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#132:1:A> Does the whole painting look like it's coming off the wall <&>

Multiple audience members agree </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#133:1:A> <O> laugh </O> So see what I mean the difference between looking

at the painting <,> and looking at the meaning behind it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#134:1:A> Right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#135:1:A> Ehm I just choose that as something specific just cos I know <,>

our time is fairly limited but I promise you that if <,> anybody here spent

twenty minutes in front of this painting with an open mind it would do pretty

incredible <,> things
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#136:1:A> The only thing is is that we live in a society even more then when

this was made <,> twenty-five years ago that we expect to get something

really quick
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#137:1:A> Right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#138:1:A> So <,> it doesn't dawn on people to look at it longer than just to

say okay it's three stripes and go onto the next thing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#139:1:A> So uhm when I do that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#140:1:A> It's just certainly one way to look at it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#141:1:A> It's not the only way to look at it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#142:1:A> But I know that <,> it gives you a <,> pretty dramatic uh effect
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#143:1:A> So that's just one thing that I choose but I certainly don't <}>

<-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> give the impression that you know you

have to have these <,> special instructions behind every one
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#144:1:A> But did you like that experience
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#145:1:A> Was it <,> cool <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#146:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#147:1:A> So you can see that you have to be here <,,> for the painting to

work
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#148:1:A> You have to be open to what it has to offer
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#149:1:A> If you spend <,> twenty seconds looking at this work <,> which is

probably more than a lot of people will spend looking at it then your

experience is going to be <,> much different than if you actually sit down

and give it a chance
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#150:1:A> Right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#151:1:A> So what we realize is a lot of what we get out of it it comes from

within us
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#152:1:A> So if we're open to what it has to offer then we'll get something
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#153:1:A> If we're just <,> you know worried about how hard it is to make

from a technical point of view we'd probably be <,> more impressed with the

person who laid down this floor
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#154:1:A> You know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#155:1:A> Uh we don't know the person's name but it's true that person has a

lot of <,> talent and was probably chosen pretty carefully because of his

technical skills
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#156:1:A> With art <,> although the technique is <,> often important some

artists feel that to accomplish their <,> idea the technique might be <,>

more simple in some cases more involved in others
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#157:1:A> It <}> <-> <-> <.> depend </.> <}> <=> </-> <.> pends </.> </->

<+> depends </+> </}> </=> </}> really what kind of things they want to get

across or what kind of idea they want to get across
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#158:1:A> Any comments or questions <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#159:1:A> No <X>

<$ZO> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X160:1:Z> <O> question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X161:1:A> Pardon me

<$ZO> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X162:1:Z> <O> repeats question </O 

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X163:1:A> In a sense </X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#164:1:A> You know I choose that because it's probably the most dramatic one

<}> <-> and and </-> <=> so </=> </}> it gets across the point really clearly
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#165:1:A> If you look at that one it does <,,> neat things too
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#166:1:A> It's a little bit more subtle
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#167:1:A>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#168:1:A> But uh certainly also in in the nineteen sixties there were a lot

of artists that worked with optical effects <,> and were interested in that

effect
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#169:1:A> I'd say with Barnett Newman what makes him a little bit different

from many abstract artists <,> is that <,> <}> <-> there's </-> <=> <,> ah he

offers </=> </}> you a little bit more
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#170:1:A> It's <O> laugh </O> hard to explain a little bit but there's kind

of ah a subject there or something <,> uhm I'd say more moving in his works

than some of the Op art that is just optical illusions <,> although I realize

that I just showed you an optical illusion
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#171:1:A> I said there's other ways of looking at it too <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#172:1:A> Okay <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#173:1:A> Any other <,> questions comments
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#174:1:A> Mhh hmm <X>

<$ZP> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X175:1:Z> <O> question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X176:1:A> <}> <-> <.> Kay </.> </-> <+> okay </+> </}> why don't we

take a look at it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#X177:1:A> <}> <-> We'll </-> <=> what we'll </=> </}> do is we'll stand up

in a certain area and we'll all look at it together </X> <&> Tape cuts out

</&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#178:1:A> And around this area so that we're in front of this <}> <->

painting </-> <=> uh sculpture </=> </}> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#179:1:A> So if you're towards the centre you'll probably have the best

point of view <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#180:1:A> <}> <-> <.> Kay </.> </-> <+> okay </+> </}> so <,> my first

question to you is <,> is this a beautiful work of art <&> Audience responds

</&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#181:1:A> No
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#182:1:A> So the artist obviously made this so we would have some kind of

reaction other than an aesthetic one
<ICE-CAN:S2A-030#183:1:A> You know we're going to look at it differently than it's a piece

of wallpaper or a new pair shoes </I>
