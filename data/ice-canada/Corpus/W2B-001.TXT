<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#3:1> <it> by Michael Crabb </it>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-001#4:1> For those with a taste for statistics the first fifty years of the

Royal Winnipeg Bal <l> let could be counted in numbers of toeshoes beaten to

a pulp, of cities visited on five continents, of original ballets created,

and of disasters that have periodically challenged the 26-mem <l> ber

company's legendary stamina and pure grit.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#5:1> Impressive, but mean <l> ingless without the story of the remarkable

human beings who have consistently breathed life into an institution that by

all common-sense reckoning should never have happened. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-001#6:1> First, let's take Winnipeg.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#7:1> No one would imply that the Prairie capital was a cultural wasteland

when those redoubtable and very English ladies Gwenneth Lloyd and Betty

Farrally arrived in 1938.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#8:1> There was music, there was theatre; above all there was a burning

civic pride.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#9:1> Even so, great ballet companies have traditionally emerged in larger,

richer, more cosmopolitan and more strategically placed cities.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#10:1> Winnipeg was a long way from anywhere and even now when curious

foreigners reach for an atlas to discover exactly where it is they must be

struck by the seeming improbability of such a city giving birth to a vigorous

cultural flower. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-001#11:1> Second, let's take Canada.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#12:1> Until Lloyd and Farrally decided to make a go of things in their

adopted home nobody else had succeeded in estab <l> lishing a permanent

ballet troupe here.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#13:1> There were attempts, of course - most notably by Boris Volkoff in

Toronto - but none that had the originality and vigour of the new

Winnipegers.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#14:1> Canada in 1938, though receptive enough to distin <l> guished ballet

companies from abroad, was still unfer <l> tile soil for the growth of an

indigenous dance culture. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-001#15:1> Lloyd and Farrally turned both conditions to their advantage.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#16:1> If Winnipeg was isolated, they could forge a company that suited

their environment; a robust troupe that would appeal to the people, that

could dance ballets about wheat and hydro-electricity as easily as it could

recreate the elegance of tradi <l> tional toeshoes and tutus.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#17:1> If Canadi <l> ans seemed content to patronize imported dance

attractions, Lloyd and Farrally would deliver some <l> thing different,

something more attuned to the particular energy of a young, ambitious nation.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-001#18:1> It took more than Lloyd and Farrally to bring these dreams to

fruition.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#19:1> Although the Winnipeg Ballet ( it picked up the useful " Royal" title

in 1953) can trace its formal origins to 1939 it could not call itself fully

professional until a decade later.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#20:1> By then rival Toron <l> tonians were beginning to formulate plans for

their own " Canadian" ballet company. <O> photograph </O> (
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#21:1> To this day Celia Franca, founder of the National Ballet of Canada,

maintains that on her arrival in 1950 she was assured that the Winnipeg

Ballet had ceased operations.) </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-001#22:1> A tenuous first decade proved that homegrown dance could find a

footing against such odds as chronic lack of money and an inadequate supply

of well-trained dancers.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#23:1> Even the disas <l> trous fire of June 1954, which destroyed most of

the RWB's material assets - including the notes of Lloyd's many

choreographies - could not consume the ambi <l> tions of those who stayed to

clear up the mess.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#24:1> This crippling, almost paralyzing disas <l> ter ushered in a

turbulent period in the RWB's history that saw the final exodus of Lloyd and

Farrally and the installation ( in 1958) of Arnold Spohr as artistic

director.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#25:1> Spohr was a former company dancer, a tall, lean, elegant partner for

the Winnipeg Ballet's leading ladies.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#26:1> When American choreographer and director Benjamin Harkarvy shook the

dust of Winnipeg from his heels just weeks before scheduled perfor <l>

mances, the company board turned to Spohr for temporary help.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#27:1> The result was the best shows the RWB had given in years and Spohr

was persuaded to take up permanent residence.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#28:1> He stayed for thirty years and still has his own office in the

impressive new &dollar;10 million home the RWB built for itself in 1988. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-001#29:1> Under Spohr the company began to attract international attention,

but it was another decade before the RWB's triumphant gold-medal-win <l> ning

visit to the 1968 Paris International Ballet Festival.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#30:1> Before that Spohr and his board of directors had had to deal with the

threat of extinction as the young Canada Council debated whether the country

could really afford three ballet troupes.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#31:1> Spohr, always a great believer in tradition and loyalty, had no

desire to wrench the RWB from the populist image it had enjoyed under Lloyd

and Farrally. <O> Distinctly dynamic: Jorden Morris and Amy Brogan in

</it> circa 1977. </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#32:1> Although the RWB presented Canada's first indigenous full-length

ballet ( <it> Rose Latulippe </it> , with choreography by Brian Macdonald) in

1966, the company did not tackle another full-length work until John Neu <l>

meier's version of <it> The Nutcracker </it> ten years later.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#33:1> For the most part Spohr stuck to the proven formula of a repertoire

of shorter works that could be mixed and matched to create programs with

broad appeal. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-001#34:1> The mixing and matching, how <l> ever, was artful in the extreme.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#35:1> It was accomplished with one eye cannily focussed on audience taste

and the other on the needs of the RWB's constantly improving ensem <l> ble of

dancers.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#36:1> In this respect Spohr served both sides of the footlights well.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#37:1> With his natural curiosity and eye for talent he became accom <l>

plished at grabbing emerging chor <l> eographers - Macdonald, Vesak,

Neumeier, Araiz - before they became too well known.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#38:1> He was willing to shock his audiences with the uncompromising realism

of Vesak's <it> The Ecstasy of Rita Joe </it> , jolt their political

sensitivities with Kurt <w> Jooss' </w> classic anti-war ballet <it> The

Green Table </it> or make an appeal to the youth of Canada with Neu <l>

meier's <it> The Game </it> ( set to a rock version of Mussorgsky's <it>

Pictures at an Exhibition </it> ) .
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#39:1> Spohr's vision of dance encompassed a range that also included the

elegant dance-for <l> dance's-sake of Dutch choreo <l> grapher Hans van

Manen, the foot-stomping good humour of Agnes de Mille's <it> Rodeo </it> ,

the pretti <l> ness of Frederick Ashton's <it> Les Patineurs </it> and the

poetic charm of Fokine's <it> Les Sylphides </it> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-001#40:1> The RWB embraced eclecticism long before other companies around

the world acknowledged it as a valid - and marketable - approach.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#41:1> Then, just when the RWB had been pigeonholed as the "

something-for-everyone" company of mixed bills, Arnold Spohr set about giving

Winnipegers the kind of multi-act spectacles that everyone had come to assume

were the prerogative of the National Ballet.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#42:1> First came Rudi van Dantzig's <it> Romeo and Juliet </it> , then <it>

Giselle </it> and most recently <it> Swan Lake </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#43:1> The timing of these produc <l> tions, as critics hastily pointed out,

coincided with the rise to fame of the RWB's most brilliant and bank <l> able

dancer, 1980 gold medal-winner at the prestigious Varna ballet competition,

Evelyn Hart.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#44:1> Certainly it made sense to mount the kind of ballets that could do

justice to Hart's talent and ambi <l> tion. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-001#45:1> In 1970 Spohr had encouraged former principal dancer David Moroni

to develop a professional training program as an extension of the RWB's

general and profitable community ballet school. <O> photograph </O> <O>

Paquita, with Evelyn Hart. Brilliant and bankable. </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#46:1> When Hart felt smothered by the hothouse pressures of Toronto's

National Ballet School it was to Moroni that she had come for help.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#47:1> Both Moroni and Spohr looked to Russia for inspiration and through

the legendary teacher Vera Volkova, in her time the major exponent of the

Vaganova training system, the RWB's professional school began to produce

dancers with a distinctly more expansive and dynamic way of moving than those

to be found in either Montreal or Toronto. </p> <O> photograph </O> <O> From

left, founders Lloyd and Farally, Arnold Spohr, Henny Jurriens </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-001#48:1> When Spohr decided to mount the big story ballets it was because

the company was ready for the chal <l> lenge, because it had to prove itself

in works that are still regarded as the acid test of a ballet troupe's clas

<l> sical credentials.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#49:1> It was an antidote to those perhaps unintentionally patronising

descriptions of the RWB as <quote> " prairie fresh" </quote> and <quote> "

youthfully exuberant" </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#50:1> It was proof that the RWB was not somehow caught in permanent

adolescence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-001#51:1> It would be foolish to pretend that the RWB can pull off a <it>

Swan Lake </it> or <it> Giselle </it> with the same depth and finesse as the

much larger seventy-member National Ballet.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#52:1> The RWB is still a company of indi <l> viduals with a variety of

physiques that often run counter to the demands of pure classicism.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#53:1> Never <l> theless, Spohr would never have produced these works if he

had doubted for a moment that his com <l> pany could dance them with integ

<l> rity - an integrity founded in total dramatic conviction and a sensitiv

<l> ity to the nuances of style.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#54:1> The RWB dances the classics its own way, but they are still the

classics. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-001#55:1> One of the dangers of artistic eclecticism as practiced by Spohr

during his thirty-year directorship is that the company itself never assumes

an identity, that it remains faceless.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#56:1> Yet nobody who has seen the RWB perform would ever call it faceless.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#57:1> Even if it lacks a consistent physical style it has a distinctive

approach to the business of per <l> forming that is strongly linked to the

troupe's pop <l> ulist roots.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#58:1> Where the National Bal <l> let at times looks more concerned to

impress with its sheer magnifi <l> cence, the RWB always evinces an insistent

urge to communicate.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#59:1> It is a company with personality, with a winning stage manner that

some <l> times flirts danger <l> ously with cute <l> ness, that overtly sets

out to enter <l> tain and that ( in David Moroni's words) <quote> " never

looks down at its audience." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-001#60:1> Oddly enough, it is questionable whether that en <l> during

personal <l> ity that survives the perennial flow of dancers, of staff

changes and even changes of director, could have happened anywhere else but

Winnipeg.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#61:1> As Evelyn Hart describes it, <quote> " there is a special commitment

about the people who come to work here.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#62:1> They are here because they are committed to dance." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-001#63:1> Now, as it is celebrating its 50th anniversary, the RWB is having

to endure one of the most emotional upheavals in its history, the cumulative

effect of three deaths.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#64:1> One, that of co-founder Betty Farrally, is a symbolic loss; the other

two, those of newly installed director Henny Jurriens and principal dancer

David Peregrine, are of more practical consequence.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#65:1> Jurriens, who died with his wife in a car crash ( on the same day

Farrally died of cancer), had already proved himself an exceptional leader.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#66:1> The dancers still feel genuinely bereft.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#67:1> The vision of the future shown them by Jurriens appears to have been

snatched away and the company must begin its second half-century under a veil

of uncertainty. </p> <O> photograph </O> <O> Dancing in spirit of the west;

</O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-001#68:1> That future, however, became a little clearer on February 2, when

the Royal Winnipeg Ballet announced it had found a new artistic director to

take over immediately from interim head Andr&eacute; Lewis.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#69:1> After an intensive search, the RWB's board of directors named

Australian-born John Meehan.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#70:1> As Meehan himself admitted, the com <l> pany is taking a calculated

risk picking him since Meehan has no previous experience directing a ballet

company.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#71:1> However, he has much else to recom <l> mend him.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#72:1> As a former star of the Australian Ballet and of American Ballet

Theatre, Meehan won critical acclaim for the nobility and theatrical flair of

his dancing.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#73:1> Canadian audiences had a chance to sample this two years ago when

Meehan starred with Karen Kain in a CBC-TV production of <it> The Merry Widow

</it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#74:1> Meehan, who turns 40 in May, says he has now retired from dancing but

the wealth of experience gained in a career that spans Broadway, London's

West End and even a stint on television's <it> The Love Boat </it> is certain

to prove valuable as he takes over the Royal Winnipegers. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-001#75:1> Those who know Meehan well describe him as friendly and open -

qualities that should suit him admir <l> ably to the almost family atmosphere

of Canada's oldest dance troupe.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-001#76:1> Meehan's task is to build on the tradi <l> tions established by

Arnold Spohr and on the vision of the future offered by Henny Jurriens. </p>
