<I>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#1:1> And <,> the other aspect of it <}> <-> it has </-> <=> it has </=>

</}> to be uh profitable has to be something in it has to be some money

otherwise it's a hobby
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#2:1> Normally <}> <-> there uh eighty a <}> <-> <.> hund </.> </-> <+>

hundred </+> </}> </-> <=> ah eighty percent </=> </}> <,> of business ideas

come from people's hobbies or their work <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#3:1> Uh in your working situation working for somebody else you'll find

business opportunities <,> sometimes <,> selling your services back to your

employer <,,> as a contractual worker <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#4:1> <?> You'll be in a win-win </?> situation
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#5:1> In other words if you can work from home <,,> and do everything you're

doing at work <,> and show your employer <?> how <?> to pay you less <,> and

no benefits <}> <-> no </-> <=> no </=> </}> <?> whether </?> sick days no

vacation and at the same time now you get to write off all the expenses <,>

then you've just found a business opportunity
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#6:1> Hobbies are another big area for business opportunities </I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-043#7:2:A> Well my name is <@> Jessica Mailing </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#8:2:A> I am a volunteer here at the gallery <,> and what I'm to do this

afternoon is to take you on a tour <,> of <,> the upstairs galleries
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#9:2:A> Mainly European <,> some American <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#10:2:A> Uh and the tour's normally an hour <,> long
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#11:2:A> And you know just go along and look
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#12:2:A> <}> <-> The <.> gal </.> </-> <=> the galleries </=> </}> are

arranged chronologically in a big <?> V </?> starting here going down there

across <}> <-> the the ah the </-> <=> the </=> </}> bottom and then up here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#13:2:A> If you look across <?> to there </?> you can see a <unclear> word

</unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#14:2:A> So <?> we're </?> getting up <,> into fairly modern art over there
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#15:2:A> And since that's the way we're going to go I just do uh <,> a sort

of a <,> cursory development of <,> uh art <?> art </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#16:2:A> We'll have a little bit of art history
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#17:2:A> We'll have some looking at paintings
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#18:2:A> You know just what whatever <}> <-> you </-> <=> you </=> </}> want

to do
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#19:2:A> Are you interested in anything in particular <X>

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2A-043#X20:2:Z> <O> Answer </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-043#X21:2:A> Hm

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2A-043#X22:2:Z> <{> <[> <O> Answer </O> </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-043#X23:2:A> <[> Italian paintings
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#X24:2:A> Ya </[> </{> </X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#25:2:A> We're starting right here with Italian paintings
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#26:2:A> <}> <-> This is </-> <=> Uhm this is </=> </}> an Italian
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#27:2:A> Well let's start right here <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#28:2:A> Uhm a painting by Simone di Martini <,> of Siena which is among the

earliest things that we've got in the gallery
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#29:2:A> This was painted <,> about thirteen twenty <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#30:2:A> It's uhm <,,> on wood <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#31:2:A> Tempera on wood which the <unclear> word </unclear> <?> hundreds

</?> were uh on wood panels
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#32:2:A> This is <unclear> word </unclear> to be part of a triptych ah ah a

three <,> part <,,> probably a devotional piece
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#33:2:A> Probably a private devotional piece
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#34:2:A> This would have been
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#35:2:A> The left hand side there would have been ah ah a middle one <,>

somewhat larger
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#36:2:A> That was a mother and child and that one is still <,> uhm on

display in Orvieto
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#37:2:A> The one on the other side is lost
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#38:2:A> They don't know where it is
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#39:2:A> But <}> <-> they the </-> <=> the way they </=> </}> can tell that

the one in Orvieto is part of one is because of this punchwork along here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#40:2:A> This is called punchwork
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#41:2:A> And <,> it exactly matches up with the one in Orvieto
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#42:2:A> So <}> <-> <.> th </.> they </-> <=> they </=> </}> were at one

time part <}> <-> of the same </-> <=> of the same </=> </}> triptych
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#43:2:A> Uhm plain gold background
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#44:2:A> <}> <-> This was </-> <=> uh at this time </=> </}> they wouldn't

have put a landscape in there or anything to distract
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#45:2:A> <?> Cos </?> this is a religious painting you were supposed to

concentrate <}> <-> on the </-> <=> uhm on the </=> </}> figure
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#46:2:A> Who was St Catherine of Alexandria
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#47:2:A> Now <,,> people <}> <-> of </-> <=> of </=> </}> that day <,>

thirteen twenty would have known right away that this was St Catherine <,>

because uhm <}> <-> they </-> <=> they </=> </}> hid <,> uh in religious

paintings <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> they're not only in <unclear>

word </unclear> ones some later ones <,> uhm have got clues in them <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#48:2:A> Attributes shown along with the saint that tell you who they are
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#49:2:A> And so Catherine's attribute is a wheel because she was uhm <,,>

put to death or they attempted to put her to death on the wheel
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#50:2:A> <?> Tying <?> her <,> body to <unclear> word </unclear> wheels <?>

and </?> rather nasty <,> results
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#51:2:A> Well actually the wheel shattered and uhm she was freed and <}> <->

she </-> <=> in the end she </=> </}> was <?> beheaded </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#52:2:A> But the wheel is the attribute of St Catherine
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#53:2:A> <?> And wherever </?> you see a picture of St Catherine you'll find

a wheel in it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#54:2:A> Uh sometimes on the ground
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#55:2:A> Sometimes she's holding it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#56:2:A> The wheel is her <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#57:2:A> And it has the spokes that you usually find <}> <-> in </-> <=> in

</=> </}> the <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#58:2:A> Also to indicate that she was beheaded she has <,> a sword in her

hand here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#59:2:A> She's got her hand around the top of a sword
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#60:2:A> And she has a pen to indicate that she was an author
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#61:2:A> So you see you've got all kinds of clues
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#62:2:A> They would also have known that she was <,> uhm from a wealthy

family by her clothing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#63:2:A> By her halo you could tell she was a religious person
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#64:2:A> So a lot of things that go right over our heads <}> <-> were </->

<=> uhm <,> could be </=> </}> <?> there </?> quite easily <}> <-> in in </->

<=> uh <,> uh in </=> </}> the days that uhm <}> <-> that </-> <=> that </=>

</}> Simone di Martini was painting
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#65:2:A> But it's typical Simone di Martini
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#66:2:A> It's typical Siennese in the beautiful <,> elegant line of the

Siennese
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#67:2:A> The Siennese <}> <-> did not </-> <=> were not </=> </}> so

interested in modern <,> <?> inviting </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#68:2:A> <?> Although </?> the use of shadow in her face here but it's

pretty flat
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#69:2:A> Pretty two-dimensional
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#70:2:A> But <}> <-> this is </-> <=> there's this </=> </}> marvellous line

that comes up and you can just follow it around
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#71:2:A> Very elegant
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#72:2:A> <}> <-> Very </-> <=> uhm <,> uh very </=> </}> graceful <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#73:2:A> Now if you have any questions or you want to make any comments go

ahead any time you want <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#74:2:A> Uhm if not we're going to keep going cos <}> <-> if </-> <=> if

</=> </}> we're to get around here in an hour uhm we really have to keep

moving <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#75:2:A> Another Italian painting <,> uhm of the Italian Renaissance by

Piero di Cosimo
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#76:2:A> Uh and it is the Italian Renaissance and there are a number of

things about it that indicate that this <}> <-> is is </-> <=> is </=> </}>

really what the Renaissance was about
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#77:2:A> <}> <-> It it </-> <=> The </=> </}> subject of it is Vulcan and

Aeolus
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#78:2:A> Vulcan here with uh the sword
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#79:2:A> Vulcan the <}> <-> <.> glo </.> god of fider </-> <=> uh <}> <->

<.> g </.> </-> <=> god </=> </}> of fire </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#80:2:A> Aeolus was the god of the winds
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#81:2:A> And he's shown here <,> with <}> <-> a </-> <=> a </=> </}> huge

pair of bellows making the wind that keeps the fire going <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#82:2:A> Uhm the reference <,,> is to uhm <,,> first of all mythological <,>

figures
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#83:2:A> Vulcan and Aeolus <}> <-> were </-> <=> were </=> </}> gods
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#84:2:A> And this is what the Renaissance was about
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#85:2:A> Going back to Greek and going back to Greek mythology going back to

the early days
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#86:2:A> Uhm as was the importance of the human being <,> Humanism
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#87:2:A> Uhm and <,> the beginning of Man as the important thing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#88:2:A> The beginning of civilization uh which was seen <,> to begin when

man got control of fire
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#89:2:A> Up until this time <,> uhm fire <}> <-> was </-> <=> was </=> </}>

something that happened but you couldn't control it and it was usually

destructive
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#90:2:A> But <,> uhm Vulcan <?> who this is </?> brought fire to man and man

could use it for his own uses to cook with
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#91:2:A> And here he's shown making horseshoes
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#92:2:A> And so with that comes civilization
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#93:2:A> And people began to tame animals
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#94:2:A> Uh they begin to build houses
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#95:2:A> They begin to live in family units
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#96:2:A> And so you have uh the beginning <}> <-> of </-> <=> of </=> </}>

society <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> this is another focus <}> <-> of

of </-> <=> of </=> </}> the Renaissance
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#97:2:A> Uhm under that is a chest
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#98:2:A> It's called a cassone chest
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#99:2:A> That's the Italian word
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#100:2:A> <}> <-> It's </-> <=> <,,> well I suppose it's </=> </}> sort of

like a hope chest <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#101:2:A> Uhm <,,> it was what brides got and grooms got it too to put <}>

<-> their </-> <=> their </=> </}> uh belongings into
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#102:2:A> It was used in a home <,> uh <}> <-> for </-> <=> as </=> </}> a

place to sit <}> <-> as a </-> <=> as a </=> </}> place to put things
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#103:2:A> The reason it's <}> <-> here there </-> <=> here </=> </}> is not

because they want to demonstrate a cassone chest but it is here to inform

these two <,> paintings over here <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#104:2:A> Two little paintings done by uh Filipino Lippi <,> who was an

Italian Renaissance painter working probably in the workshop of Botticelli
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#105:2:A> And these paintings when they were made they're not made to hang

on the wall in a <?> sense </?> like you see them here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#106:2:A> They were made to go on a cassone chest
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#107:2:A> And cassone chests were <,> uhm very often decorated with three

paintings
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#108:2:A> And you read it <,,> well in a series
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#109:2:A> You <}> <-> read <}> <-> em </-> <+> them </+> </}> </-> <=> read

it </=> </}> starting over there on the left end
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#110:2:A> That would be the first part of the story
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#111:2:A> Then a big painting across the front
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#112:2:A> And then the denouemount <,> would be uh on this end here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#113:2:A> And so these are two that were commissioned by an Italian family
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#114:2:A> One was the story of Esther <}> <-> the the </-> <=> the </=> </}>

Jewish biblical heroine
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#115:2:A> And the other one was the story of Mordecai
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#116:2:A> Esther went on <}> <-> the <}> <-> <.> woma </.> </-> <+> woman's

</+> </}> </-> <=> <}> <-> the the </-> <=> the </=> </}> bride's </=> </}>

chest and Mordecai on the groom's chest <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#117:2:A> And uhm <,,> this one here <,> <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}>

Esther <}> <-> did the </-> <=> Bottecelli did not do the </=> </}> painting
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#118:2:A> Or it's not known exactly whether he did or not but it's thought

<,> that he probably turned it over to Filipino Lippi who was <,> one of his

star pupils and who did a lot of these cassone chests
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#119:2:A> So you see Esther <,> uhm approaching the palace
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#120:2:A> Uh the king has sent for a number of young women to come in
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#121:2:A> He's going to pick a new wife <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#122:2:A> And that is the one in the far end
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#123:2:A> And the big one here which is in France <,> shows the king with

the women assembled who does pick Esther
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#124:2:A> And the one on the end which is in the Horne Museum in Florence

shows her leaving <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#125:2:A> Uhm <,> now <,,> <}> <-> it </-> <=> it's </=> </}> typically <,>

Italian Renaissance in the grace uhm the beauty the elegance of the form uhm

the way she's <,> seen approaching the castle but <,,> hesitant about it

because she doesn't know what's <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}>

happen and what she's getting into
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#126:2:A> And the <}> <-> <.> hesi </.> </-> <=> hesitance </=> </}> is

indicated by <,,> the way her foot is dragging and the way her dress is sort

of dragging not coming along
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#127:2:A> And this is echoed by the tree here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#128:2:A> The shape of the tree <,> you see it has the same graceful shape

the same lines as she has with a little bit <}> <-> of </-> <=> <}> <-> that

</-> <=> that </=> </}> </=> </}> suggests here <?> the </?> shrubberies here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#129:2:A> <}> <-> This is is </-> <=> It </=> </}> was one of the first uses

of landscape in the picture
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#130:2:A> It's called supportive <}> <-> landsch </-> <=> landscape </=>

</}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#131:2:A> And it supported <,,> the main figure
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#132:2:A> So you see Esther coming up in this very elegant fashion <}> <->

to uh the the </-> <=> <}> <-> <?> and </?> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> </=>

</}> the colours <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> the rendition uh that was

typically Renaissance
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#133:2:A> The other one is Mordecai
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#134:2:A> This was a groom's chest
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#135:2:A> And this tells another story
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#136:2:A> Mordecai on the first panel comes to Esther and tells her that the

king has issued an edict saying that all Jews will be put to death
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#137:2:A> And she is Jewish but the king does not know it <,,> which seems

to me to be a peculiar part of the story but anyway
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#138:2:A> Uhm <,> this is in the Book of Esther <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#139:2:A> Uh he says to her come and talk to him and see if you can <,> talk

him out of this
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#140:2:A> It's as much as her life is worth to go into the presence of the

king without being summoned <,> and so she hesitates
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#141:2:A> She doesn't know what to do but in the end she decides that she

must risk her own life to try to free her people
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#142:2:A> She goes
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#143:2:A> Uhm and that is the large one uh <}> <-> <.> sh </.> </-> <=>

showing </=> </}> her coming into the presence of the king
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#144:2:A> She talks the king out of his edict
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#145:2:A> And this is the final one <,> where you see Mordecai coming out of

the castle <,> and <,> the horse is being led by Haman who is the man who <,>

proposed the edict in the first place and he's now <,> reduced to the

<unclear> word </unclear> of the groom and leading Mordecai's horse
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#146:2:A> Mordecai is <}> <-> victoried </-> <=> <,> victorious </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#147:2:A> The horse is prancing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#148:2:A> <}> <-> It </-> <=> it </=> </}> <?> almost </?> seems to me as

though the horse is laughing <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#149:2:A> Uhm <,> so <}> <-> these these uhm <,> this is </-> <=> these are

</=> </}> the stories
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#150:2:A> This is the kind of art that was being done at that time
<ICE-CAN:S2A-043#151:2:A> And <,> uhm <}> <-> it </-> <=> it </=> </}> gives us another idea

<}> <-> of </-> <=> of </=> </}> art and what art was used for <}> <-> when

we </-> <=> you know when you </=> </}> can see a cassone chest and know <}>

<-> that </-> <=> uh <,> that </=> </}> that was used uhm <}> <-> to <,> uh

</-> <=> <,> to uh </=> </}> decorate the chests </I>
