<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#2:1> ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#3:1> A REPORT BY GORDON NICKEL

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#4:1> In the midst of sharing God's Word at a Baptist retreat on the

shores of the Mediterranean Sea near Alexandria, Egypt, I had to ask myself

once more what I had ever done to deserve this privilege.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#5:1> Beside me, my enthusiastic translator, a veterinarian from Assiut,

rendered my English into a melodious Arabic.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#6:1> The Baptist young people sitting be <l> fore me accepted the words

they were hear <l> ing as God's message for them.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#7:1> Through my northern European eyes, these Egyptian Arab evangelicals

looked very attractive.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#8:1> I felt it an honour to have them welcome me, a stranger, into their

fellowship - never mind to have them invite me to preach! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#9:1> Of course, I had done nothing to deserve the privilege, and that

came back to me again and again as I enjoyed a nine-day visit to Egypt in

August, 1995.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#10:1> The entire trip was arranged by Samir Youssef, a Mennonite Brethren

who pastors the Arabic Evangelical Church in New Westminster, B.C.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#11:1> He had lived most of his life in Egypt, and only a few years ago

immigrat <l> ed to Canada with his wife Lewiza and sons David and Martin.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#12:1> Samir had come to Egypt several weeks earlier and had arranged

the schedule for us ahead of time.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#13:1> My son Matthew and I arrived August 21.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#14:1> We were on our way back from Pakistan, where we had worked for three

weeks together with MB Missions/Services workers Tim and Janine Bergdahl in

witness to the Baluch people in Karachi. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#15:1> Samir met us at the Cairo airport and took us straight to the

city of El-Fayyoum, where he was preaching in a Free Methodist church.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#16:1> After two evenings there, we overnighted back to Cairo for a meeting

in a lively church on the poor side of town. <O> photograph </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#17:1> Then we took the train to Upper Egypt for three days in Assemblies of

God and Pres <l> byterian churches in Assiut and Tema.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#18:1> Final <l> ly we overnighted to Alexandria, for this Bap <l> tist

retreat and for revival meetings in anoth <l> er Free Methodist church. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#19:1> The Christians welcomed Matthew and me because they knew Samir.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#20:1> Samir has many friends in Egypt through his earlier ministry as a

pastor there.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#21:1> His father was a famous pas <l> tor and leader in the Presbyterian

Church in Egypt.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#22:1> I saw that Samir is greatly loved by a wide variety of Christians in

Egypt, and seemed to know just about everyone.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#23:1> He is a fine evangelist and revival preacher, and it was great to see

him in action.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#24:1> Samir sings songs which inspire the people; when he preaches, he

seems to have everyone in the palm of his hand with humour and emotion <l> al

appeals, all the time taking full advantage of the beauty and rhythm of the

Arabic lan <l> guage. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#25:1> We met several former professionals who are now in full-time

ministry because of Samir's encouragement.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#26:1> When I talked with various evangelical church leaders, I was im <l>

pressed with their strength of character and their competence in ministry.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#27:1> Though they spoke in a very realistic way about the diffi <l> culties

of being Christians in an extremist en <l> vironment, they did not complain

but rather testified that God is blessing the church.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#28:1> Dur <l> ing our days in Egypt, I saw a variety of very solid

ministries done by the evangelical churches, including Christian education,

ra <l> dio witness and follow-up, development of discipleship materials, and

compassionate ministries such as a large orphanage in Assi <l> ut. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#29:1> Samir and I were glad to represent the Mennonite Brethren in

Egypt, and during his stay Samir handed out to his church leader friends

about 1000 copies of the Mennonite Brethren Confession of Faith.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#30:1> When Samir had first accepted the MB Confession and joined the MB

church, he had translated the Confession into Arabic.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#31:1> The booklet he passed out in Egypt was thus " bilingual". </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#32:1> Church leaders read through the Confes <l> sion and responded in

thoughtful, interest <l> ing ways.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#33:1> On one occasion, I was conversing with two young Baptist pastors, and

told them that Mennonites have traditionally not participated in war or even

in military train <l> ing. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#34:1> The pastors asked, <quote> " Do you still not partic <l> ipate in

military training?" </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#35:1> <quote> " No, we still do not participate," </quote> Samir an <l>

swered for us.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#36:1> This is no insignificant point for Egyptian men, who are required by

law to take two years of military training. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#37:1> Preaching 11 times in eight days did not leave a lot of time for

the sightseeing we wanted to do.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#38:1> But Matthew and I were able to see the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid

at Giza, and we spent an afternoon at a resort beside Lake Qaroun near

El-Fayyoum.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#39:1> Later on in the trip, we were able to do a bit of shopping in

Alexandria and take a dip in the blue-green waters of the Mediterranean

there. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#40:1> On the last day of our time together, sitting in the living room

of Samir's mother's apart <l> ment in Alexandria with a pleasant breeze

blowing in through the open balcony doors, we reflected on the possibilities

of European-background Mennonite Brethren and Arabic Mennonite Brethren doing

something to <l> gether in the Middle East. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#41:1> <quote> " There are millions of people who need a ministry in

Egypt," </quote> we agreed. <X> <quote> " Our goal is to bring people to

Jesus Christ.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#X42:1> We stand for a <w> Believers' </w> Church." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#43:1> Samir and many Egyptian evangelicals have a special burden for

members of the Or <l> thodox Coptic Church who do not yet have the joy of

knowing Jesus Christ.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#44:1> When they speak of " evangelism", they normally have these people in

mind. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#45:1> Mennonite Brethren Missions/Services, on the other hand, has a

desire to expand its gospel witness among Muslims, the religious group which

makes up the majority of Egypt's population.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#46:1> It was clear from our ex <l> plorations that this kind of witness

would only be possible through local Egyptian Christians themselves. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#47:1> Considering an entry into a new region raises important questions

about how we re <l> late to local churches.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#48:1> The Orthodox Coptic Church, for example, goes back to the time of the

early church, and it has been faithful through nearly 1350 years of Muslim

rule.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#49:1> Another crucial question is how MB initia <l> tives might relate to

the established work of Mennonite agencies in the region, such as Mennonite

Central Committee. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#50:1> Samir and I didn't have the authority to make decisions in any

case; we were only there to explore.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#51:1> But that didn't stop us from dreaming together.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#52:1> When Arabic Mennonite Brethren open up windows for us into a region

where we have not yet worked as a church, might these not at some point be

<l> come doors of opportunity?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#53:1> It wouldn't be the first time that our non-European MB fel <l>

lowships have led us into privileges of min <l> istry which we've done

nothing to de <l> serve.

prayer </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#56:2> BOTSWANA

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#57:2> MBM/S missionaries in Botswana, Bryan and Teresa Born, have

issued an urgent plea for prayer in September for the AIDS-dec <l> imated

population of Botswana.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#58:2> The country has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world. (
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#59:2> HIV is the virus which develops into AIDS, eventually resulting in

death.) </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#60:2> In August, the Borns attended a gathering of ministers and health

officials where the grim statistics, say the Borns, <quote> " broke our

hearts and brought us to our knees." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#61:2> The numbers are staggering; they represent a hor <l> rendous toll of

human suffering, grief and death that threaten to wipe out Botswanan society.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#62:2> &bullet; 50% of the students at the University of Botswana - the

only university in the coun <l> try - are HIV+.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#63:2> Barring a major medical break-through, almost all the infected will

die in 5-10 years. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#64:2> * In the major towns and cities, 40% of pregnant women test

positive for AIDS; many of the children will be born under a sentence of

death. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#65:2> &bullet; 25% of all persons over 15 are infected.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#66:2> Re <l> searchers fear that the figure will double in four years. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#67:2> <h> <bold> CHRISTIANS MOBILIZE </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#68:2> At the August meetings, the concerned Christians declared

September a month of prayer and repentance.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#69:2> Churches are being challenged to follow the pattern prescribed in II

Chronicles 7:14: <quote> " If my people, who are called by my name, will

humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways,

then I will hear from heav <l> en and will forgive their sin and will heal

their land." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#70:2> Along with the call for national repentance, special events will

be organized in major towns and villages.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#71:2> Workshops will train the healthy <quote> " to take care of the sick

and dying, as well as help the grieving," </quote> say the Borns. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#72:2> <h> <bold> PRESIDENT TO PROMOTE MORALITY </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#73:2> The president of Botswana, Sir Keitumile Masire, will open the

educational campaign on September 1 with a speech decrying ram <l> pant

sexual promiscuity and embracing <quote> " the biblical principles of

abstinence before mar <l> riage and absolute faithfulness within mar <l>

riage" </quote> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#74:2> Meanwhile, the Borns need fresh energiz <l> ing from the Holy

Spirit. </p>

of this people." </quote>

<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#79:3> <h> <bold> Mission adventure for Zaire Mennonite conferences </bold>

</h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#80:3> For many years Zaire Mennonite conferences concentrated most of

their outreach efforts in Kinshasa, Bandundu and Kasai provinces.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#81:3> In 1994, with the outbreak of ethnic conflicts in Rwanda, attention

turned to eastern Zaire, first with humanitarian assistance and now for

church planting in Bukavu, near the Great Lakes Re <l> gion. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#82:3> The three Mennonite conferences in Zaire, in collaboration with

their partners, Mennonite Brethren Missions/Services, Africa Inde <l> pendent

Mennonite Missions and Mennonite Central Committee are sending two couples

into the region.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#83:3> In affirmation, the MBM/S Board has allocated &dollar;5,200 to share

in this partnership. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#84:3> Two features of the Great Lakes Project are especially

noteworthy. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#85:3> 1. The excellent advance work of two lay leadership couples al

<l> ready involved in organizing a local congregation. &bullet;
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#86:3> Fidel and Christa Lumeya were sent by MCC to work in the area as

coordinator of MCC program in the region.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#87:3> Before going to Bukavu, they were very involved in Kinshasa church

life of the Zaire MB conference. &bullet;
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#88:3> Dr. and Mrs. Kalumuna were involved in a congregation in Kin <l>

shasa.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#89:3> This tent-making couple went to Bukavu with the blessing and

financial assistance from their congregation and with the hope of planting a

church. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#90:3> Thanks to these two couples, a local international congregation

has fully organized in Bukavu with 50 people meeting each Sunday for worship.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#91:3> A congregational Bible study meets each Friday evening. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#92:3> 2. Mission Training Through Local Structure.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#93:3> In addition, two Mennonite pastor couples are getting ready to be

sent to Bukavu as the first missionaries to the region.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#94:3> Before starting, both couples are immersed in a nine-week training

program especially designed for them by the International Missiology Center

run by Dr. Nzash Lumeya.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#95:3> Courses include Anabaptist history, history of the Great Lakes

region, history of African religions, cultural anthropology, bib <l> lical

theology of mission, conflict resolution, cross-cultural commu <l> nication,

personality studies, church administration and group dy <l> namics. </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#106:4> John H. REDEKOP

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-007#107:4> During the 26 years I lived in Waterloo County, On <l> tario,

the Old Order Mennonites were a constant source of fascination, at times also

of inspiration, and occasionally of disappointment.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#108:4> The fascination related to their dogged determination to retain a

distinctive and very old-fashioned lifestyle.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#109:4> The inspiration arose from their insistence on being a separate,

peaceful people who practised authentic simplicity and mutual assis <l>

tance, and avoided all forms of vengeance.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-007#110:4> The disap <l> pointment pertained to their preoccupation with exter

<l> nalities, especially dress codes, their rejection of com <l> promise on

non-essentials of the gospel, their adamant insistence on conformity, their

apparent indifference to the Great Commission, and their general legalism.
