<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#2:1> Frances Itani

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#3:1> Pauline was startled by the sudden memory.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#4:1> Mae West swung herself around and said, " <foreign> Ich habe meine

Schl&uuml;ssel im Zimmer liegen gelassen. </foreign> "
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#5:1> This was hopeful; Pauline's first dream in German.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#6:1> The evening re-runs on the ten-inch black-and-white were invading, but

they were invading dubbed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#7:1> Pauline put her own front door key on the ring, gathered up the

garbage, and called for Maggie.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#8:1> Maggie had been learning about Japan during the past week at school

and had borrowed Pauline's kimono to practise her geisha kick.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#9:1> Since breakfast she'd been doing a high-speed shuffle around the

dining room circuit, her right foot making a side-stepping circle, followed

by a quick below-the-knee thrust under the cloth.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#10:1> The extra folds of kimono - a foot longer than Maggie - were even

straightening out behind.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#11:1> Pauline would have laughed if <foreign> Frau </foreign> Becker hadn't

been on her mind. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#12:1> The past five weeks, <foreign> Frau </foreign> Becker had been

arriving with food when she came to clean on Fridays.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#13:1> Not only had she been bringing food, she'd begun to ask for food.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#14:1> Last week she'd brought windfalls, a paper shopping bag of them bump

<l> ing against the front fender of her bike.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#15:1> They'd been in her storeroom most of the winter and were shrivelled,

almost dried.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#16:1> The week before that, a torte - Maggie called it a pie ( Fraud

Becker's solid body shaking with laughter at the abrupt <l> ness of the word)

- and before that, six brown eggs, the feathers of her dark hens still stuck

to the splotchy shells. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#17:1> " Butter," she'd said, the first time, to Pauline.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#18:1> " <foreign> Sie k&ouml;nnen mir Butter bringen. </foreign> "
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#19:1> She'd even opened her change purse, taken out two mark seventy, and

snapped it shut again.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#20:1> She offered the coins with a quick glance into Pauline's face.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#21:1> " <foreign> Sie verstehen, Frau Travers, </foreign> " she said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#22:1> " <foreign> Sie verstehen. </foreign> "
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#23:1> And yes, Pauline understood.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#24:1> <it> German in 15 Easy Lessons </it> had been at her bedside table

for six months now, and anyway, who wouldn't have understood the word "

<mention> butter </mention> ."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#25:1> It was just that trading or even selling goods from the commissary

was - " ver <l> boten."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#26:1> And she'd been warned by Richard's host family when she arrived.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#27:1> Once the villagers find out you have a NATO con <l> nection, she'd

been told, look out.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#28:1> Coffee, butter, sugar, especially cigarettes and whisky. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#29:1> But it didn't seem like that to Pauline who was the one, after

all, who had to look directly into <foreign> Frau </foreign> Becker's face,

the one who had to read what was behind the eyes.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#30:1> She'd pushed the hand back, and <foreign> Frau </foreign> Becker had

returned the coins to her purse.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#31:1> But before she'd reached for her mop and chamois, she'd held three

fingers up to Pauline, her order firmly placed, " <foreign> Drei pfund

butter, bitte. </foreign> " </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#32:1> The following Friday, three packages of butter were tucked into

the bicycle bag and the order given for the next week, " <foreign> Schinken

</foreign> ."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#33:1> <foreign> Frau </foreign> Becker seemed to know that ham in the

commissary that week was half the price of ham in the village store, though

Pauline could not even think about how she got this information.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#34:1> The commissary was in the city and <foreign> Frau </foreign> Becker

did not go to the city.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#35:1> She did not speak one word of English - except to say to Maggie, "

<}> <-> Byeee-Byee </-> <+> bye bye </+> </}> , " as she left each Friday at

four.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#36:1> The rest of the time, she muttered through her work as if telling

herself stories.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#37:1> Stories which Pauline could not or was not to know.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#38:1> And complicated explanations, such as the reasons why commissary

purchases were " ver <l> boten," Pauline could not struggle through.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#39:1> " <foreign> Es tut mir leid.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#40:1> Ich verstehe nicht </foreign> , " she could say, as her book had

taught her.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#41:1> " I'm sorry.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#42:1> I do not understand."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#43:1> But <foreign> Frau </foreign> Becker's head, with the grey-blond bun

pinned tightly behind, gave the nod now, each week when she placed her order:

you understand. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#44:1> Pauline stood for a moment by the radio.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#45:1> Maggie had the dial set on the short wave, her way of satisfying her

longing for her own language.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#46:1> Pauline turned the knob, just catching a German voice speaking

English - a woman's voice: " <}> <-> Nine-ty-five </-> <+> Ninety-five </+>

</}> <}> <-> pair-cent </-> <+> percent </+> </}> said they <}> <->

pray-fair-red </-> <+> preferred </+> </}> <}> <-> blond-is </-> <+> blondes

</+> </}> ! "
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#47:1> And then, it was lost.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#48:1> Gone in a garble of static and tongues and retorts. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#49:1> She left the key under the lantern for <foreign> Frau </foreign>

Becker, helped Maggie with her jacket, and together they wheeled the outdoor

garbage container to the curb.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#50:1> She thought of Mae West, one hand on a hip, the other holding out her

kitchen and bathroom bags to the garbage collector: " <foreign> Sie haben

meinen M&uuml;ll verges <l> sen. </foreign> " </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#51:1> Their skates were in the back of the car.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#52:1> The rink was on the edge of the city, a twenty-minute drive.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#53:1> An indoor rink, and a good thing, too, as the air seemed unsettled

today.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#54:1> Pauline was becoming used to the chill, the snowless winter, the blue

light.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#55:1> Already - and it was only February - the farmers were burning off the

feathery growth of last year's asparagus.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#56:1> But she thought she could smell something wild, the wind, per <l>

haps, holding patterns of dust over long mounds in the fields.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#57:1> Or a storm, unseen, but about to move down into the valley in a

horizontal black line. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#58:1> Grades three and four from the International School would be

skating; Pauline was a parent-helper.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#59:1> The school would be closed in the afternoon, so she'd bring Maggie

back with her and stop at the commissary on the way home.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#60:1> <foreign> <it> Kaffee </it> </foreign> , this week.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#61:1> Three half-kilo packages.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#62:1> Never so much asked for that Pauline could protest, not really.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#63:1> Still, she imagined, over time, a pantry shelf in <foreign> Frau

</foreign> Becker's tiny farm bulging with North American staples that

Pauline herself was providing.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#64:1> A thought flashed through her mind, not for the first time.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#65:1> <it> What if <foreign> Frau </foreign> Becker was selling these items

to the villagers? </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#66:1> She bit hard on her bottom lip.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#67:1> This was paranoia.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#68:1> For those few things.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#69:1> Richard, though - she had not told Richard.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#70:1> Wasn't he part of the administration that kept tight control over

this very activity?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#71:1> In any case, it was going to stop.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#72:1> She would hand over the coffee that afternoon and firmly say, "

<foreign> Nicht mehr.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#73:1> Ich kann nicht. </foreign> " </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#74:1> Wasn't <foreign> Frau </foreign> Becker well paid?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#75:1> Didn't Pauline agree to the exact hourly wage <foreign> Frau

</foreign> Becker had requested that first day she'd propped the old bike

beside the rose bushes and stood ex <l> pressionless in the doorway, waiting

to be hired?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#76:1> Hadn't Pauline been more than fair?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#77:1> But the eyes of <foreign> Frau </foreign> Becker seemed to be fixed

on her from the windshield and Pauline had to shake her head to keep the car

from being towed into the fast lane as she joined the lunatic speed of the

autobahn.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#78:1> She hoped <foreign> Frau </foreign> Becker would arrive today without

food.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#79:1> It would make it easier to say, " <foreign> Nicht mehr.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#80:1> Icht kann nicht. </foreign> " </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#81:1> The rink was crowded because busloads of children had ar <l>

rived from German schools, too.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#82:1> And although the loudspeaker blared instructions to skate in <it> one

</it> direction, there were, of course, skaters who darted in and around and

against the solid oval rush that glided like a heavy murmur.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#83:1> Rock music, instructions again, more music.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#84:1> <it> The Rules </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#85:1> Pauline never entirely felt that she knew <it> The Rules </it> in

this country.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#86:1> Blasted over loudspeakers in rinks, posted on fences at outdoor

pools, welded to locker doors at indoor stadiums.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#87:1> It was she who barged into <}> <-> change-rooms </-> <+> change rooms

</+> </}> from the wrong side ( and was chased back by custodians), she who

emerged wearing boots where only bare feet were permitted, she who entered

turn <l> stiles through exits, who forgot to bring her market basket to

stores that did not provide bags, who pulled out the wrong cur <l> rency in

lineups at the <foreign> <it> B&auml;ckerei </it> </foreign> , who did not

know the word <foreign> <it> &Ouml;l </it> </foreign> at the gas station.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#88:1> It was she who, with Maggie beside her, had walked across village

field roads with a present for their landlord's three-year-old baby and, when

the door was opened and they were greeted, blurted out, " <foreign> Ein gift,

f&uuml;rs baby </foreign> , " not knowing until she dug out the pocket

dictionary on the way home that <foreign> <mention> <it> gift </it>

</mention> </foreign> was the word for poison.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#89:1> ( " Why didn't the mother invite us in to see the baby?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#90:1> Why?"
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#91:1> Maggie kept asking.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#92:1> " I could see its crib across the kitchen.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#93:1> You didn't say anything awful, did you?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#94:1> Did you?")
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#95:1> The door was shut slowly, in their faces. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#96:1> When all the laces were tied and mittens pulled onto small hands,

Maggie and her Grade 3 friends entered the stream of skaters and formed a

chain on the ice.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#97:1> The music was fast, and several older skaters were twisting in and

out at high speeds.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#98:1> Pauline watched from the boards and stepped out just as the music was

about to change - probably the direction, too.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#99:1> This instruction was shouted out that very second, as if Pauline had

thought it through the loudspeaker.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#100:1> The ribbon of skaters wavered, seemed to buckle, and executed a

surprisingly grace <l> ful about-face. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#101:1> It was as she rounded the curve on her skates that, out of the

corner of her eye ( how she would go over and over this), Pauline saw the

tall youth go down when a fast skater darted close to him at the far end of

the rink.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#102:1> He was bigger and taller than the hundreds of school children on the

ice, and when he fell Pauline noted four things ( remembering these later,

much later): how far he had to fall because of his height; that his legs had

been moving awkwardly; that he wasn't wearing a helmet ( German children did

not wear helmets at the rinks, whether they were beginners or not); that he

went over backwards, his head being the first part of him to strike the ice.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#103:1> When her legs had taken her to the end of the rink she bent over

the boy, and the small group around him made way as she kneeled beside his

head.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#104:1> The music had switched to a waltz; the skaters carried on.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#105:1> But the boy - he seemed sixteen, seventeen - was convulsing

violently, his back an arc, his legs and arms spastic, saliva oozing from the

side of his mouth, his head rising and falling from the ice.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#106:1> And the most terrible thing - a click, a regular clicking sound

coming from some deep deep part of him.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#107:1> The children who had bunched round, seemed poised in terror.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#108:1> Two adults circled close and went back to their skating.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#109:1> Pauline held the boy's head and shoulders gently in her arms until

the terrible writhing and clicking - which seemed to go on for minutes - was

over. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#110:1> " <foreign> <it> Bitte </it> </foreign> , a stretcher, an

ambulance!" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#111:1> She was shouting.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#112:1> If he had been with friends, they had dis <l> appeared.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#113:1> If he was with a school, no teacher arrived.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#114:1> The boy was unconscious, it seemed, but began to stir. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#115:1> " No, you must not move," Pauline told him softly, know <l> ing

he could not understand but that he would stay as he was. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#116:1> A man wearing a blue windbreaker, shoes - no skates - slid over

from the nearest gate.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#117:1> He was smoking a cigarette, looked at the boy, looked at Pauline,

shook his head.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#118:1> He called out be <l> hind him and two young men brought a stretcher

onto the ice.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#119:1> As Pauline kept the head and neck straight, they lifted the boy and

transported him to a sparsely equipped first aid room. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#120:1> " An ambulance," Pauline said again.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#121:1> " Please, call an ambu <l> lance."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#122:1> The man in blue waved an arm - Yes, yes, the <foreign> <it>

Krankenwagen </it> </foreign> was on the way. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#123:1> And that was that.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#124:1> No one stayed.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#125:1> No friends inquired.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#126:1> Only Pauline, talking softly as the boy made confused at <l> tempts

to move his arms, his legs, to raise himself from the stretcher.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#127:1> The two were alone in the room. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#128:1> Maggie's face appeared round the doorway.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#129:1> " Mom, is he all right?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#130:1> Did the boy die when he fell?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#131:1> " Oh, Maggie, I hope he's okay.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#132:1> He had a very bad fall.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#133:1> Can you wait for me on the benches?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#134:1> As soon as the ambulance gets here, I'll come for you." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#135:1> But when the ambulance came, she could not make the at <l>

tendant understand about the convulsion.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#136:1> " It's important.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#137:1> A head injury.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#138:1> He fell."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#139:1> Her hands pointed to his head; she mimed the fall, the bump.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#140:1> " The doctors must be told about the convulsion." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#141:1> The boy was quickly put into the ambulance; the faces blank; no

one spoke English.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#142:1> Did they understand? </p> </I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-011#143:1> " Convulsion!"
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#144:1> Pauline did not know the word.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#145:1> <foreign> " Es ist wichtig! </foreign>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#146:1> It's important."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#147:1> But there was no dictionary in her bag today; she'd wanted to be

free of weight at the rink. </I> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#X148:1> And the two attendants?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#X149:1> She wasn't certain, from their faces, that they understood.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#X150:1> She tore a piece of paper from a gauze wrap <l> per and wrote, "

Convulsion.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-011#X151:1> Lasted more than 1 minute." </p> </X>
