<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-045#218:1:A> I think that's a good point <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#219:1:A> Like every time you have a discipline problem ask yourself why <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#220:1:A> Why did you have that problem <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#221:1:A> <}> <-> That's what I Usually </-> <=> Cos whenever </=> </}> I

have a problem <,,> a discipline problem <,> it goes back to that idea of any

group of kids can certainly become problem
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#222:1:A> And it's usually has to do with the way <}> <-> you <,> you </->

<=> you </=> </}> presented your activity
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#223:1:A> It usually has <.> w </.> the activity itself
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#224:1:A> You know always question the activity <,> that you're working with

<,> you know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#225:1:A> But <}> <-> what I'm what I that's </-> <=> that's </=> </}> a

part of class management
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#226:1:A> And uhm <,> but <}> <-> what I </-> <=> what I'm </=> </}> trying

<}> <-> to </-> <=> to </=> </}> say is that <,,> you will always have

discipline problems
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#227:1:A> And you have to deal with the discipline problems
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#228:1:A> <}> <-> This this </-> <=> This </=> </}> uhm <,,> student that

you have <,> okay <,> a student who is hyperactive
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#229:1:A> You're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> have to deal with

that student <,> for the rest of the year
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#230:1:A> So you're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> have to find

ways <,> to deal with that student <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#231:1:A> You're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> have to <,,> you

know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#232:1:A> You have no choice <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#233:1:A> The thing <}> <-> that that that that that </-> <=> that </=> </}>

is <}> <-> a </-> <,> <=> a </=> </}> big problem today in teaching <,> in my

<,> opinion is that <,> a lot of <,> teachers think they have a choice <,>

and that choice is to do nothing <,,> but that's not a choice cos you're just

<}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> have more discipline problems
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#234:1:A> You're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> <?> have </?>

many many many more discipline problems <,> than if you <.> s </.> take it

<,,> head-on <,,> and you think about it <,,> you know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#235:1:A> And you try to find solutions
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#236:1:A> I think <,> discipline problems the worst discipline problems <,>

turn into solutions <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#237:1:A> The kids that you'll have the problems with <,> could become your

best students after <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#238:1:A> You know these things will happen
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#239:1:A> <}> <-> When I'm <.> tea </.> </-> <=> You know that it sounds <,>

ah <,,> </=> </}> you know like that kid isn't <}> <-> <.> i </.> the <}> <->

wor </-> <=> worst </=> </}> </-> <=> the ones </=> </}> <}> <-> who </-> <=>

who </=> </}> cause you the most problems could be your best most interesting

students <,,> you know <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#240:1:A> Could be the most dynamic could be the funniest <,> you know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#241:1:A> Could be the most <,> creative <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#242:1:A> But <}> <-> they're </-> <=> they're </=> </}> wasting their time

in school
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#243:1:A> And they give up <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#244:1:A> They've given up in school a lot of them you know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#245:1:A> Like they find it <,> boring and stupid

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-045#289:1:A> But <}> <-> the </-> uh <=> <,,> I think one of <}> <-> the

the </-> <=> the </=> </}> </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#290:1:A> That's a good point <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#291:1:A> And that's a good point too <{> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[> <[> <O>

Audience members laugh </O> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-045#292:1:A> I can see all of your points <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#293:1:A> And the idea is that you have <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#294:1:A> One of the things you'll notice when you walk in the classes <,>

is each class has its energy <,> you know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#295:1:A> And <}> <-> a </-> <=> a </=> </}> class can have a negative

energy like a class can have a positive energy
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#296:1:A> And <}> <-> what you </-> <=> what class management </=> </}> has

to deal with <}> <-> in in uh <,> in uh </-> <,,> <=> in </=> </}> uh

teaching what class management has to do is how you're going to control <,,>

or <,> manipulate that energy to <.> k </.> make it into a positive energy
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#297:1:A> A learning energy <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#298:1:A> Your <,> goal is always learning
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#299:1:A> So <,,> you have to think of ways to do that <,,> okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#300:1:A> And that has a lot to do with motivation <,> okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#301:1:A> How you're going to motivate your students <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#302:1:A> And <,> what I'm trying to tell you is you have your first part

which is <,> very traditional teaching <,> and then you have to start <,>

learning <,> how to motivate your students and to make your class more

interesting
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#303:1:A> Cos the traditional will not work that long <,,> right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#304:1:A> You know what I mean
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#305:1:A> <}> <-> <}> <-> <.> Li </.> </-> <+> Like </+> you you </}> </->

<=> You </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#306:1:A> You know how long you do vocabulary <,> you know what I mean

before they catch on <{> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[> <[> <O> Audience members

laugh </O> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-045#307:1:A> <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#308:1:A> It's true <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#309:1:A> So <}> <-> you have to </-> <=> you have to </=> </}> start <,>

you know <,> getting more and more
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#310:1:A> And it's a kind of a tricky
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#311:1:A> And I'll tell you <}> <-> this is the </-> <=> this is </=> </}>

when you're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> be more insecure <,>

because <,> you'll have the students <,> okay like uh <,> you have them <}>

<-> in your </-> <=> in their </=> </}> <.> s </.> places and you're doing

vocabulary you're walking <?> around </?> and you're going okay what's this

word and <,> you know you're kind of arr arr arr <&> funny noise </&> you

know you got your <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#312:1:A> And then <unclear> word </unclear> you're <?> not </?> <}> <->

gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> start making them <,,> do group work <,>

and <,> cooperative learning <,> <}> <-> and </-> <,> <=> and </=> </}> then

you start getting scared
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#313:1:A> Cos it's insecure right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-045#314:1:A> It's an insecurity cos <}> <-> you're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going

to </+> </}> let it </-> <=> you're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}>

let your whole structure </=> </}> grow into a new one <,,> and you have to
