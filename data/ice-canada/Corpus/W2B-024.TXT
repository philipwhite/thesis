<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#1:1> “It is a real privi <l> lege to be doing something you love so much,”

she says.

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#2:1> Dr. Anthony Burke, another member of <}> <-> <}> <-> UVic </-> <+>

University of Victoria </+> </}> </-> <+> University of Victoria </+> </}> ’s

astronomy group, has in the past undertaken significant theoretical studies

on the formation of stars and on the interstellar medium, which is the dif

<l> fuse gas between stars.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#3:1> Recently he has concentrated on teaching and adminis <l> tration.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#4:1> He arrived at the university in 1968, has served on the Senate for

most of the past ten years, and is the current chair of the Senate Honorary

Degrees Committee. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#5:1> Dr. Jeremy Tatum and Dave Balam, a research assistant who has been

at <}> <-> UVic </-> <+> University of Victoria </+> </}> for 14 years, work

as a team to observe asteroids ( which are referred to as minor planets),

comets and other bodies in space.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#6:1> The astronomers make measure <l> ments of the <w> objects’ </w>

positions and com <l> pute their orbits.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#7:1> This aspect of the disci <l> pline is called astrometry, and Tatum

says that Balam is “one of the finest astrometrists that Canada has ever pro

<l> duced.” </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#8:1> Tatum and Balam form one of only about eighteen observing teams in

the world, and there are even fewer orbital computing teams, Balam says.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#9:1> Usually the two functions are performed by dis <l> tinct groups, but

the <}> <-> UVic </-> <+> University of Victoria </+> </}> duo is diver <l>

sified enough to do both. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#10:1> Tatum and Balam have several tasks, one of the most significant

of which is observing minor planets which have been provisionally numbered by

the international Minor Planet Center.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#11:1> Tatum and Balam calculate precision orbits so that the objects may be

perma <l> nently numbered.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#12:1> They also obtain pre <l> cise positions of short period comets.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#13:1> The most timely of their objectives is to provide rapid astrometry

for newly-dis <l> covered comets and unusual asteroids in response to

telegrams from the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams of the

International Astronomical Union in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#14:1> They are often able to provide this information within a few hours of

receiving a tele <l> gram. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#15:1> “The main emphasis in the study of the solar system is on what

things are, but first you have to know where they are,” Balam says.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#16:1> <X> “We find things so that others can study them.” </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#17:1> A central irony in the discipline is captured by Balam when he

says, “Over the years, I have seen only three of the things I have worked

with: comet Halley and two others.”
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#18:1> While many astronomers are drawn to the field by their love of

looking at the stars, like John Climenhaga, once they enter the field as

professionals their major contact with stellar objects is by looking at pho

<l> tographic plates or CCD-generated images.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#19:1> Even for people who are primar <l> ily observers, computations are

much more a part of their daily astronomical routine than staring into space.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#20:1> That romantic notion of astronomy is not lost completely,

however.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#21:1> Chris Spratt, who is a gardener with <}> <-> UVic </-> <+> University

of Victoria </+> </}> Buildings and Grounds, is one of the world’s foremost

amateur astronomers.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#22:1> He carries his eight-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope around with

him, and “can’t pass by a clear night without looking at something.”
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#23:1> Most clear evenings Spratt, who lives in a condo <l> minium that does

not afford good view <l> ing, will drive to Cattle Point or a friend’s house

and observe for two to three hours.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#24:1> He says that September through October and March through April are

the best times of year for visual observations. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#25:1> Spratt also works in conjunction with Balam and Tatum.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#26:1> He receives the co <l> ordinates of a comet from them, then is able

to locate it with his telescope.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#27:1> He gathers information, especially on new comets, and enters it into

a computer at home.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#28:1> Spratt is able to measure the mag <l> nitude of a comet and to make

visual observations about unusual activity in variable stars.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#29:1> “In a way I feel like I’m helping the scientists,” he says. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#X30:1> “Also, for thousands of years humans revered the stars.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#X31:1> At one time, mankind was geared to the stars and was more attuned to

nature. </X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#32:1> I’ve had this interest since I was about nine,” Spratt says, and he

finally managed to get his own telescope when he was 15.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#33:1> “My mother thought I was a bit off,” because of his interest in

stars, he adds. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#34:1> Spratt’s success as an amateur astronomer should certainly have

al <l> layed any fears that he is “a bit off.”
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#35:1> He has received the Chant Medal and the Ken Chilton Prize, both of

which are awarded by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, in recognition

of his visual observations of comets, variable stars, asteroids, and

eclipses.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#36:1> He was named the top variable star observer in the world in 1976-77

and was second in 1980-81.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#37:1> He has published numerous papers in <it> The Journal of the Royal

Astronomical Society of Canada </it> , <it> The Journal of the American

Association of Variable Star Observers </it> , and <it> Astronomy Magazine

</it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#38:1> He has also written editorials for lay readers that have appeared in

the <it> Globe and Mail </it> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#39:1> Tatum says of the astronomers at <}> <-> UVic </-> <+> University

of Victoria </+> </}> , “We tend to be pretty much indi <l> vidual scientists

doing what we want to do and being successful at it.”
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#40:1> Students who have come through the <}> <-> UVic </-> <+> University

of Victoria </+> </}> astronomy program are beginning to make their mark in

the world of astrono <l> my as well.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#41:1> Tatum says that in his read <l> ing of the literature in the field,

he has begun to see a number of <}> <-> UVic </-> <+> University of Victoria

</+> </}> astrono <l> my graduates publishing important papers.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#42:1> “They are becoming good astronomers in their own right,” he says.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#43:1> Staff of the Climenhaga Observatory are also making <}> <-> UVic

</-> <+> University of Victoria </+> </}> ’s program acces <l> sible to

younger students.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#44:1> Lab instructor Russ Robb is an eager and enthusiastic tour guide for

high school students and others who choose to view the dome as part of a

campus tour.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#45:1> He demonstrates the power of the sun’s heat by placing a pencil under

the ray reflected by a small telescope on the Elliot Building roof.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#46:1> The pencil immediately beings to smoke and is on the verge of

bursting into flames when he pulls it out of the ray.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#47:1> He then shows guests the inside of the dome and explains the

operation of the main telescope; if Venus or some other body is visible on

the day of the tour, he will focus the telescope on it to give the guests an

extra treat. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#48:1> Humans have always been fascinated by the sky and what lies

beyond our world.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#49:1> Astronomers at <}> <-> UVic </-> <+> University of Victoria </+> </}>

have become international leaders in the quest to know and understand the

origins, his <l> tory, and secrets of the universe. </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#50:2> If flower <l> ing plants become leggy and pale, refuse to flower

and lean towards a light source, move them to an east window where they will

get more light.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#51:2> Plants in a north window in the sum <l> mer may have to be moved to a

brighter location in the winter. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#52:2> <h> The east </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#53:2> Many plants benefit from the cool morning sun that radiates

through an east-facing window.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#54:2> Eaves and over <l> hangs lessen the duration of direct sun from this

exposure.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#55:2> If you are unsure about a plant’s light requirements, an east window

is a safe bet.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#56:2> It receives up to four hours of sun per day, which many flowering

plants appreciate. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#57:2> <h> The south </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#58:2> The seasonal variation in light from the south is greater than

any other exposure.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#59:2> In the summer, bright, direct light fills the room and is at its most

intense at midday.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#60:2> Tropical flowering plants, cacti and succulents do well in this

window. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#61:2> <h> The west </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#62:2> Even though the sun is not at its highest in this window, it is

at its hot <l> test for four hours in the afternoon.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#63:2> Cacti, succulents and some tropical foliage plants do well here.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#64:2> West-facing windows are not always hot because elevation and latitude

play an important role in light intensity, which is higher in the mountains,

where the air is thinner, than at sea level. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#65:2> Many tropical flowering plants do well with a western exposure

during the summer.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#66:2> If possible, cacti and suc <l> culents should be moved to a window

that faces south in the winter. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#67:2> <h> Hanging plants </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#68:2> Many hanging plants may suffer from too little light even when

placed in a bright, sunny window.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#69:2> When ceil <l> ings are high and windows are low the plant dangles

above the light.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#70:2> To rec <l> tify this, attach brackets to the wall beside the window

and hang the plant there, tie a rope to the hanger to lengthen it or select

plants that need less light. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#71:2> <h> Skylights </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#72:2> Many people have skylights in their homes, which add extra light

for plants to grow.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#73:2> How big the skylight is and how far it is from the ceiling of the

room to the top of the skylight deter <l> mines the type of plant that should

be placed there. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#74:2> Some openings are over six feet ( 2 m) from the ceiling to the

roof of the house, which allows for limited light.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#75:2> To grow plants up the shaft is an appealing idea but it’s hard to

main <l> tain the plants.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#76:2> Note the hours of direct sun and the intensity of light the skylight

receives and select plants accordingly. </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#77:3> <?> But </?> Ronald Worton, geneticist-in-chief at Toronto’s

Hospital for Sick Children, said that, until recently, various organizations

that fund Canadian scientific studies, including the National Research

Council, the Medical Research Council ( MRC) and the Natural Sciences and

Engineering Research Council ( NSERC), have as yet been unable to agree on

which agency should provide the money, or where the money will come from.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#78:3> One problem is that agencies want specific research proposals, which

scientists say they need money to provide.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#79:3> Said Worton: “It’s a fairly complex undertaking that can’t be

presented as a regular research proposal, or funded from the existing pot.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#80:3> So nobody is quite sure where to start.” </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#81:3> The global project that Canadian scientists want to join is aimed

at producing, by the early 21st century, a complete so-called map, actually a

huge chart, showing the exact molecular sequence of about 100,000 genes, the

genetic code-carrying units that are embedded in the deoxyribonucleic acid,

or DNA, that makes up the core of human cells.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#82:3> Each gene contains part of the overall genetic blueprint that

determines the physical makeup of all forms of life.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#83:3> The information is encoded in combinations of four chemical “bases,”

as scientists call them – adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#84:3> Each piece of genetic information directs cells to produce proteins

that determine everything from the height of a man and the color of his hair,

to the shape of a woman’s foot and her tendency to develop certain illnesses.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#85:3> In <?> all </?> , a total of three billion DNA bases are involved in

determining human characteristics. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#86:3> The project that involves charting each of the bases and the

genes they make up, so that doctors will some day know exactly which gene is

responsible for every function of the human body, is the first comprehensive

project to embrace the science of molecular biology.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#87:3> The brainchild of Robert Sinsheimer, then chancellor of the

University of California at Santa Cruz, the idea attracted the attention in

1986 of James Watson, the American biologist who, with British biologist

Francis Crick, discovered the molecular structure of the DNA molecule in

1953.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#88:3> In 1988, the Bethesda, Md.-based U.S. National Institutes of Health (

NIH) established an office of human genome research, led by Watson, to

co-ordinate American efforts to map the genome. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#89:3> Despite the delay in establishing a Canadian contribution to the

project, Canada is a highly regarded participant in genetic research.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#90:3> Last August, doctors at Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children located

the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis, a fatal disorder that affects one

in every 2,000 children and causes excess mucus to clog the lungs and

digestive system.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#91:3> The team leader was Dr. Lap-Chee Tsui, who says a complete genome map

would have allowed the discovery to take place three years earlier.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#92:3> “Right now, scientists have to start locating genes again with each

new project,” he said.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#93:3> Tsui and other supporters say the proposed computerized map would

eliminate that need, increasing scientific efficiency and enabling small labs

to work in complex genetics. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-024#94:3> The same hospital’s Worton is a member of the executive of the

Human Genome Organization, a Geneva-based group of about 250 scientists from

two dozen countries that was set up last year to promote international

collaboration in the genome effort.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#95:3> Said Worton: “Canada is a world leader, so people will naturally ask

why we’re dragging our feet on a project that will have huge payoffs for the

public and industry.”
<ICE-CAN:W2B-024#96:3> Last October, Worton helped to write a general proposal for Canadian

genome research, which called for grants from Ottawa of between

$25 million and

$50 million during the next five years. </p> </I>
