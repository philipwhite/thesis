    Since the early part of this century women have gradually gained  access to compete for better jobs in Canada.  They have however, been prevented from success in their attempt to  become equals in the workplace through systemic discrimination.  As well as women; native Canadians, visible minorities and persons  with disabilities have also been subjected to discriminative hiring policies  and practices by a majority of employers in Canada.  In a society based on the ideals of liberal democracy, this type of  blatant discrimination can not be allowed to continue any longer.     ious groups to have equal opportunity to achieve their full potential in  Canadian places of business, the government must enact laws that will force  employers to dismantle existing dis  criminatory hiring policies.  Employers would also be required to put into place new hiring  procedures to ensure equality for specific groups within society who are  presently proportionately under represented in certain fields of work.  The necessity for such laws has come about for the main reasons that,  first of all, the government policy of allowing businesses to undertake such  programs voluntarily has failed denying many Canadians equality of  opportunity in the workplace.  As well/ secondly, it will be shown that the main arguments against  affirmative action are invalid if the proper programs are implemented.    To fully understand the conflicts between those for and against  affirmative action we must look at the cases put forward by both sides of the  debate.  tive action we must define it  as it should be by any government legislation so that it will be both  effective and equitable to everyone concerned.    Affirmative action must be seen as a policy to ensure equal  opportunity to members of groups, such as women, natives, the disabled and  visible minorities, who have been subjected to discriminatory hiring policies  in the past.  This policy would also be implemented without penalizing equally  qualified white males who have been the beneficiaries of past hiring  policies.  Whether or not these policies have intentionally been set up to act  as barriers is of little consequence and will therefore not be discussed  beyond this point.  Equality for white males as well as the " quota system" of  affirmative action will be elaborated on later.  Presently we will turn our attention to the case against affirmative  action.    The strongest argument to be a made by those opposed to  affirmative action is that; if quota systems are implemented many qualified  applicants will have to be overlooked while many un  qualified applicants  will be given a job just because of their sex, race, ethnic background or  disability.  This is a valid argument as can be seen by simply looking at the  example of this exact problem occurring at Harvard Medical School.  Since 1968 the administration of the Harvard Medical School has  reserved twenty percent of first year admissions for what they classify as "  members of disadvantaged minority groups" ( Roberts p. 219).  In a study of the qualifications of students who were admitted to the  medical program because of this quota system, it was noted that " for them,  the usual requirements of high grades and MCAT scores were greatly relaxed" (  Havender in Roberts p.219).  A similar situation is documented at the University of California  Medical School where, because of the quota system in place, the entrance  marks of minority group members were " lower than the minimum required for  white applicants" ( U.S. News and World Report in Roberts p.219).  Another closely related argument deals with the possible, if not  likely, consequences of putting an unqualified person in a position, via the  quota system, where they are likely to fail or " perform incompetently".  The argument follows that, with increased demands on ability many of  those who achieved a position because they belong to a " minority group" will  not be able to meet the standards required of them ( Van den Haag in Roberts  p.219).  In addition, some argue that this failure will cause considerable  damage to the person's self-esteem.  Another argument put forward by critics of affirmative action is that  it causes problems between those groups who do not benefit and those who do;  as well as within the latter group.    It has been stated that within the groups that should benefit  from affirmative action policy, there are some who believe that they have the  right to receive extra benefits " simply because their ancestors were subject  to discriminatory treatment" ( Roberts p.219).  This in turn has two interesting consequences.  The first is that these people will not be motivated to acquire the  knowledge or skills that they do need to achieve their desired success.  Secondly, according to L.W. Roberts, is that those who do not benefit  from affirmative action will sense that they are still being subjected to  discriminatory treatment.  As a result, those within a target group who do not gain anything  from affirm  ative action policies may resent others of the same group who  do benefit.  Another consequence is that there will be those in the group not  meant to benefit from affirmative action policies, specifically white males,  who will begrudge those who have been advanced to their position for a reason  other than ability.    Another challenge put forward against affirmative action is that  it will penalize working class families and benefit mostly middle and upper  class couples and families.  Conrad Winn has argued that affirmative action will hurt working  class families in which the male is the sole income earner because he will  face increased competition from women prospering from new hiring and  promotion policies in all fields of employment.  It can not be denied that there is a very strong case against the  mandatory implementation of affirmative action policies!  We will now turn our attention to the case for affirmative action.      bution of women, Natives, visible minorities and the disabled across job  categories, and in their distribu  tion up and down the ranks of the  occupational hierarchy. ( Agocs p. 194)    The statement above is based on extensive data showing that the  groups mentioned have in fact, through discriminatory hiring policies, been  effectively kept from performing up to their full potential in Canada.  The reason for the present situation, it is argued, is the lax  government policy on discrimination in the workplace.  The following is a summary of affirmative action as it has been in  Canada.     tively pursue an increase in the number of Natives and franco  phones in  the civil service; this was the beginning of affirma  tive action in  Canada.  In 1977 the Canadian Human Rights Act became the first piece of  legislation passed by the federal government in support of its affirmative  action policy.  As well, since 1979 the Canadian Employment and Immigration  Commission ( CEIC), a part of the Department of Employment and Immigration,  has tried to convince employers to partake in voluntary affirma  tive  action plans.  By June of 1984 over 900 firms had been offered assistance in setting  up an affirmative action program.  However, of all those approached only sixty-seven of them had  actually signed agreements to voluntarily set up affirmative action programs;  of those sixty-seven only five of them followed through and developed  affirmative action policies!  Women were the only group covered by all 67 of the agreements.  Fifty-two of them covered Natives and the disabled but only five  covered Blacks and other visible minorities ( CEIC in Agocs p.197).  The main problem facing the CEIC was that the contracts were not  legally binding and more often than not the firms only agreed to sign them  because of ulterior motives ( Agocs p. 197).  ous that up until this point government policy, with  respect to affirmative action, has resulted in only disappointment.  To fully understand the plight of the disadvantaged groups it will be  helpful to look at some statistics concerning their position in the Canadian  labour force.    Women, who make up close to half the work force, earn only 63  percent of what males with similar qualifications earn.  Native women earn only 40 percent of the wage men do, and half of all  disabled persons who want to work are unemployed ( Geller 239).  Supporters of affirmative action contend that laws requiring  employers to adopt affirmative action policies to advance those groups who  are not now fairly represented is the only way to provide equality of  opportunity in the workplace.  These laws are necessary to remove systemic barriers for members of  the groups mentioned previously to have an equal opportunity to be hired and  for them to be able to rise through the ranks into the hierarchy of firms.     Although those opposed to affirmative action have supported their  argument well, there can be no doubt that the time has come for mandatory  affirmative action legislation to be passed.    A quota system is no good.  Qualified white, males will be losing out to unqualified persons from  target groups in areas of the work force where quota systems are in place.   " such programs ( quota systems) represent the extreme end of the  continuum"  ( Roberts p. 218).  As more women receive post-secondary education the number of women in  the upper management positions will come to properly present women in the  work force if certain laws are put into place.  If both a man and a woman are equally qualified for a job the woman  should be hired until such time that women and men are represented  proportionately in the work force according to data base      We must also take into consideration that Canadian society is  changing.  ingly  outnumbered women in terms of being better educated and in terms of sheer  number of applicants for a desired position.        " Kubla Khan", one of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's most  controversial works, has a shroud of mystery looming over it which is partly  due to the events leading up to its creation.  If Coleridge is to be taken literally, then the poem is a fragment of  a dream he had as he roughly describes in the preface.  is not  a fragment, and is as complete as Coleridge could make it.  Consisting of many opium-induced dreamlike visions, Coleridge must  have taken the time to put together these crazy ideas into their currently  polished state.  Images relating to sexuality, nature and life itself, yield a brief  glimpse of Coleridge's paradise, and show the dangers of viewing such a  paradise.    " If  Coleridge had never published his Preface, who would have thought of " Kubla  Khan" as a fragment?"   Indeed the legitimacy of the Preface is problematic, for the poet was  forever down-playing his accomplishments, he notoriously plagiarized, and  likely edited and revised the poem before it was published.    ( 330),  and never seemed particularly confident about his accomplishments.  Thus he may have been trying to deflect criticism by describing "  Kubla Khan" as a  ( 353).  " adapted ( or simply adopted) passages from  other writers, with little or no acknowledgement, and sometimes in a context  that seems designed to obfuscate his literary motives and to reveal the  subterfuge"  ( 330).  While Coleridge likely created " Kubla Khan" himself, his lack of  ethics certainly allowed him to alter the " true" story as he saw fit.    " On awakening he  appeared to himself to have a distinct recollection of the whole, and taking  his pen, ink and paper, instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines that are  here preserved"  ( 353).  Given the rhyme scheme and stanza form, it seems strange that a poem  so well written could be composed while asleep.  " He lacked  application and staying power  ( 330), so Coleridge must have worked  on the poem.   The shadows these three doubts cast, seriously weaken the  plausibility of " Kubla Khan" being a fragment half-remembered, and lend  credence to House's claim that  " Coleridge played, out of modesty,  right into the hands of critics"
