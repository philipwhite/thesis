<,,> putting your backs up against <,> getting winter tires
<ICE-CAN:S1A-078#164:1:A> I mean <,> they seem so urban

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-078#165:1:B> Well they are they've lived in Toronto all their lives
<ICE-CAN:S1A-078#166:1:B> I mean they've live in Toronto but they <,> you know do a lot of

</{> <,> equipment <,> for looks
<ICE-CAN:S1A-078#169:1:A> It's because it's like that hard and it's that tough and it's that

slippery you know what I mean
<ICE-CAN:S1A-078#170:1:A> And <,,> it's like they didn't really seem to <}> <-> wanna </->

ended up getting them
<ICE-CAN:S1A-078#172:1:B> But by the same token I mean <}> <-> when they <,> </-> <=> when

they <=> </}> go on their trips they basically go to <,> some place park the

car at some lodge and take off on foot
<ICE-CAN:S1A-078#173:1:B> It's not like they're <,> driving any place you know

<ICE-CAN:S1A-078#180:1:B> They're not freaked out by it
