<I> <h> <}> <-> Jan. </-> <+> January </+> </}> 17, 1992 </h> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#1:1> Dear Mom, </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#2:1> Well, things seem to be back to as normal as they get around here.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#3:1> We had a doozy of a storm Tuesday and Wednesday - - started with

pouring rain Tuesday night, then freezing rain, then snow and high winds and

COLD.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#4:1> I think it fell from 0 to - 29C ( that's - 20 <}> <-> Fahrengrade </->

<+> Fahrenheit </+> </}> ) in 24 hours.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#5:1> The poor old Honda was covered in a thick coat of ice and all but one

of the doors were frozen shut.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#6:1> In fact, we only got the passenger door open this afternoon after the

temperature had risen to a balmy - 7 or so.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#7:1> I guess I told you in my note that the pipes froze but not really

solidly, so we got the water going again after a half hour or so.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#8:1> It was below freezing in the basement so we turned the heater on down

there to warm it up a bit. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#9:1> We were awakened early Wednesday morning by cracking noises coming

from the roof.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#10:1> It was just the joists popping from the cold; I guess that happens

when they contract.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#11:1> It was pretty disconcerting though, until we figured it out. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#12:1> Even with both stoves going, it is still pretty cold in the house

when the outside temperature gets so low.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#13:1> We had to keep the bathroom door open so the pipes wouldn't freeze,

so that made it even colder.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#14:1> We have lots of sweaters and everything, but we don't have long

underwear ( yet), so I've been wearing my pyjama pants under my jeans to keep

my legs warm.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#15:1> The air below knee level was very cold yesterday, even close to the

stove.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#16:1> Don't know how the cats stand it; they don't seem to mind, <}> <->

althought </-> <+> although </+> <}> one is instantly in your lap when you

sit down. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#17:1> It was only - 18C this morning when we got up, and by this

afternoon it had warmed up to about - 7C, but then it started to snow. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#18:1> In spite of all of the above, for the first time in my life I'm

starting to appreciate winter.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#19:1> I endured it as a kid ( didn't have much choice) but it's different

now.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#20:1> Even shovelling our 150-foot driveway is fun, if you can believe

that!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#21:1> And of course, driving can get kind of exciting.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#22:1> The roads have been very slippery, especially today because we had

snow and wind, so the snow covered the ice which was already on the roads,

making them very treacherous. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#23:1> <@> Paul </@> and I have gone for long walks in the forest,

looking at the animal tracks and trying to identify all the trees and plants.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#24:1> So far just deer and rabbit tracks are the only ones we are sure

about, but there are lots of tracks that look like fox or coyote ( there's a

real problem with coyotes here - - the people down the road lost 20 sheep a

week last summer to coyotes). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#25:1> We have a book which identifies the dried weeds which one finds

in winter.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#26:1> Just find an interesting skeleton sticking out of the snow and low

and behold, the book tells you what it is ( or was).
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#27:1> Then we go to the summer weed book and see what it looks like when it

is alive.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#28:1> We have a lot of something called Pepper Grass, which have really

peppery seeds. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#29:1> We may look into the idea of growing Ginseng.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#30:1> It grows wild in this area, and in the summer there are ads in the

paper from people wanting to buy it.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#31:1> People forage for it and I guess it has been pretty well wiped out in

many areas.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#32:1> It is not easy to grow, and the plants must be nurtured from 5 to 7

years before the roots can be harvested, but the stuff is almost worth its

weight in gold. </p>

<p> Got up early the other day and baked two loaves of bread in the wood cook

stove.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#33:1> Takes five hours from start to finish when you use yeast.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#34:1> Tasted good.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#35:1> I don't think I let it rise enough the second time and I burned it a

bit on top, but it wasn't too bad for the first time.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#36:1> Used <w> goats' </w> milk from <@> Heidi </@> instead of water like

in the recipe. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#37:1> We've been down to visit <@> Heidi </@> a couple of times.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#38:1> We see her about once a week to get eggs and milk.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#39:1> She's doing not too badly; worried as usual about getting her next

mortgage payment together.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#40:1> She types transcripts for CBC Radio, and that pays her bills, but I

wish she would get an additional source of income so she isn't so dependent

upon them. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#41:1> We were talking to a neighbour of <@> Heidi </@> 's the other

day; a woman by the name of <@> Wilma </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#42:1> She and her husband bought an old farm up the highway about 8 years

ago, fixed up the original farm house a bit, then decided to build a new

house on the property because it cost the same as completely renovating the

old one.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#43:1> Anyway, they said that three generations of the original family had

lived in the place without either a well or an outhouse; a period of about 70

years or so.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#44:1> They got water from a spring on the property, and I guess they used a

pail for the toilet ( hopefully a different pail).
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#45:1> So we're not suffering here at all when you consider what people used

to put up with. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#46:1> We have a barn full of pigeons, and we will have to get rid of

them.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#47:1> They have pooped all over the place and have ruined all the hay

stored there.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#48:1> Once the hay is contaminated it can't be used for anything but

compost.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#49:1> We will probably have to scrape out the barn too.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#50:1> We can't have a whole lot of wild pigeons around if we are going to

have chickens, because the pigeons will pass on all kinds of parasites etc.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#51:1> The first thing we are going to try is bird seed soaked in beer.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#52:1> The theory is that it should get them good and plastered so we will

be able to pick them up and wring their drunken little necks.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#53:1> I don't relish doing it, but I guess you have to make choices.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#54:1> Besides, I haven't had squab before. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#55:1> <@> Paul </@> 's asthma is really acting up.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#56:1> It started when he got a cold the week before Christmas, and it

hasn't really let up.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#57:1> He is feeling fine - - no sore throat or anything, but he gets some

terrific coughing fits, almost like whooping cough.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#58:1> He went to the doctor today who wants him to try something else

besides his puffer, but there isn't really much he can do.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#59:1> Evidently when you have asthma, you're stuck with it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#60:1> I've been slowly unpacking my books, although the boxes in my

room here have just about reached gridlock.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#61:1> I've been working on a story for the Star short story contest, but

its going slowly.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#62:1> Has to be mailed by the end of the month. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#63:1> Thank you again for the great shirt.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#64:1> I am going to look for a couple more so I can build up a supply.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#65:1> <}> <-> Its </-> <+> it's </+> </}> always warm shirt time in this

house. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#66:1> I've been to the library here and even got a library card.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#67:1> They've got some vertical files with all kinds of historical stuff -

- really interesting, but all crammed together in an awful jumble.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#68:1> I want to find out about a mysterious James Dobie who was granted

land south of here in 1821.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#69:1> He is mentioned once in a history of Lanark County.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#70:1> Will go to the land registry office in Perth to see if they have the

original deed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#71:1> Have you talked to the <@> Ford </@> 's yet about going to

Florida?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#72:1> Some real sunshine would be a treat for you, although I guess it can

get cold in Florida at this time of year, even if they would never admit it.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#73:1> Well, I guess that's about enough blathering.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#74:1> I've put enough in here for two letters.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#75:1> Will try to mail this tomorrow ( Saturday). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#76:1> Love, </p> </I>


<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#77:2> April 9, 1992 </h> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#78:2> Dear Mom, </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#79:2> Well, spring has finally but <}> <-> truely </-> <+> truly </+>

<}> arrived.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#80:2> The snow has gone from all but the north- and east-facing hills and

the birds are arriving by the hundreds.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#81:2> This afternoon there was a flock of more than 60 cedar waxwings in

one of the big maple trees on the hill behind the house.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#82:2> In the last week we've seen robins, bluebirds, hawks, swallows,

redwing blackbirds, herons ( five flying together today), ducks; and heard

loons and geese.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#83:2> Of course there are also lots of birds which I can't identify. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#84:2> We've been back to the creek several times, the last time two

days ago, and there was just frozen slush along the shore with open water in

the middle.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#85:2> You can hear the beaver dam roaring loudly when you stand outside the

house.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#86:2> No sign of flowers yet, although there are a few green leaves

starting to show in the fields.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#87:2> I keep looking for Trilliums and other spring flowers, but so far

just dead leaves. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#88:2> <@> Kitty </@> had to spend a couple of days at the vet.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#89:2> On Tuesday we noticed he couldn't urinate, so we took him in and they

had to stick a catheter in him so he could pee.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#90:2> We are supposed to put him on a diet of food which costs &dollar;2.00

a can!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#91:2> However, they said that any low magnesium food would be <}> <-> OK

</-> <+> okay </+> </}> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#92:2> We noticed that Purr, which we feed both the cats, is very low in

magnesium, so <@> Paul </@> suggested that maybe it is the water that is

causing the problem - - you know how much mineral is in our water.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#93:2> I guess we should get it analyzed.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#94:2> <@> Paul </@> says the soil is very high in magnesium so the water

probably is too.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#95:2> We now are giving the cats distilled water, so that hopefully that

should do the trick. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#96:2> We bought a wood-splitter on Monday.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#97:2> Saw an ad in the paper, so drove out to a farm near Ottawa to see the

thing.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#98:2> The owner is a retired Navy officer, and he and his wife run a crazy

place that is basically a huge petting zoo for kids.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#99:2> He said that they have thousands of school kids every year come on

school outings ( all paid admissions of course) to see the animals.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#100:2> They have the usual assortment of chickens, ducks and geese, and

also donkeys, sheep and goats, a llama, pigs and horses and probably lots of

other things.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#101:2> However they had a couple of pigmy goats which were the cutest

things you've ever seen.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#102:2> The adults are the size of regular breed baby goats, so I imagine

the pigmy babies are like kittens.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#103:2> This man knew <@> Ted Grimshaw </@> in the Navy.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#104:2> <@> Ted </@> was a good friend of mine in high school. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#105:2> Anyway, the wood-splitter is a big hydraulic piston which rams a

piece of wood into a stationary blade, thus splitting the wood.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#106:2> It is powered by a gas engine, so sounds like a dozen chain saws

running at once.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#107:2> However, it will beat splitting eight cords of wood by hand, not to

mention halve our wood cost by letting us buy 8 cords of logs.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#108:2> We will then cut the logs into pieces with the chain saw and split

them with the splitter. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#109:2> We spent several hours yesterday and today preparing seeds.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#110:2> We bought a couple of soil blockers which compress potting soil into

different size squares into which you put seeds for sprouting, one seed per

block of soil.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#111:2> When the seedlings are ready to be put into the ground, you don't

have to separate seedlings from each other, thus damaging the roots - - you

just pop each soil block into the ground, containing its sprouted seed.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#112:2> This also means that you don't have to thin out seedlings like you

do when you plant seeds in the ground. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-003#113:2> We are using a mixture of potting soil and worm castings for the

seeds.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-003#114:2> There is a place in Perth which sells worm castings - - they are

really cheap, &dollar;8.00 for a 60 pound bag. </p> <O> rest of letter </O>

</I>
