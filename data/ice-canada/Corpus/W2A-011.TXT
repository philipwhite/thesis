<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#2:1> <h> PART 1: A LITTLE HISTORY </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#3:1> We humans are profoundly social animals.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#4:1> The biological success of our species - our numbers, our worldwide

distribution - depends in no small measure on our ability to acquire

behaviour socially: to use and, over generations, to improve upon one

another's responses to environmental challenge.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#5:1> Members of our species, however, are not unique in using the behaviour

of others to guide their own responses to life's demands.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#6:1> Like us, various insects, fishes, birds, and mammals can exploit the

behaviour of conspecifics to bias their own behavioural development in

adaptive directions. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#7:1> We humans are, apparently, exceptional in our spontaneous use of

arbitrary signs and symbols to communicate with our fellows.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#8:1> We may well be unusual both in intentionally teaching others how to

behave ( Barnett, 1968; Ewer, 1969; Galef & Dalrymple, 1978) and in the

extent to which we acquire motor skills by observing and then imitating our

more accomplished fellows ( Davis, 1973; Galef, 1988b; Roberts, 1941; Thorpe,

1963).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#9:1> However, it is only recently that evidence supporting even these

relatively simple statements about differences in the processes supporting

social learning by members of our own and other species has become available.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#10:1> For many decades, the processes used by animals and by humans to

learn socially were assumed to be identical. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#11:1> <h> <it> Did It All Begin With Gall? </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#12:1> Late in the first half of the 19th century, Franz Gall, father of

phrenology, quoted with approval the following passage from the works of the

French philosopher and naturalist Charles-George Leroy to show that animals (

in this case foxes), like humans, used arbitrary sounds, <quote> " verbal

language" </quote> ( Gall, 1835, p. 26), to communicate ideas and emotions:

</p> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#X13:1> <quote> It is certain from observation, that before having been able

to instruct themselves by personal experience, the young foxes on leaving the

burrow, for the first time, are more distrustful, and more cautious in the

places where war is often made on them, than in places where the snares have

never been spread.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#X14:1> This observation, which is incontestable, proves absolutely the need

they have of language; for, without it, how could they acquire the knowledge

of proper precautions, which knowledge supposes a succession of facts known,

of comparisons made, of judgments rendered?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#X15:1> It appears then, that it is absurd to doubt, that brutes have among

them a language, by means of which they transmit ideas, the communication of

which is necessary to them. </quote> ( Leroy, 1802, in Gall, 1835, p. 29)

</X>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#16:1> To the modern reader, Leroy's views on the mechanisms of animal

social learning and Gall's uncritical promotion of them ( assuming, for the

sake of argument, that naive young foxes do, in fact, behave as Leroy

asserted they do) may suggest that both gentlemen were singularly thoughtless

or gullible.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#17:1> It is, however, probably more reasonable to assume that the failure

of Gall and of Leroy to provide a convincing explanation of the avoidance by

naive, young foxes of areas containing snares arose not from thoughtlessness

or gullibility, but from a lack of alternative hypotheses to explain the

behaviour of foxes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#18:1> For the contemporary reader, aware of the existence of

pheromones, in general ( Wilson & Bossert, 1963), and of warning pheromones,

in particular ( von Frisch, 1941), or knowledgeable about the ways in which

European blackbirds ( Curio, Ernst, & Vieth, 1978) or rhesus monkeys ( Cook,

Mineka, Wolkenstein, & Laitsch, 1985) come to avoid potential predators,

observations of social influences on avoidance are not evidence of an ability

of animals to communicate using language.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#19:1> However, if, like Gall and Leroy working in the 19th century, we

today knew of no means other than language for the transmission of

information between individuals, then any evidence of animal communication

would serve us, as it served Leroy and Gall, as evidence of human-like speech

in nonhumans.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#20:1> Gall and Leroy did not lack intellectual prowess, they lacked

alternative hypotheses with which to explain the behaviours in which they

were interested. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#21:1> <h> <it> Imitating Romanes </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#22:1> Attribution of social influences on the development of behaviour

in animals to their use of language disappeared from the scientific

literature in mid-19th century.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#23:1> Unfortunately, explanation of social learning by animals in terms of

humanlike speech was replaced by an equally misleading, equally

all-encompassing explanation of social influence on behaviour that proved

considerably more difficult to reject than Leroy's idea that animals talk to

one another about matters of importance. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#24:1> Darwin, Wallace, Romanes, Morgan ( for much of his life), and

other, lesser known naturalists of the latter half of the 19th century

treated learning by imitation as the primary way in which animals acquire

adaptive behaviour.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#25:1> The ability of animals to learn by imitation was taken for granted.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#26:1> The only question to be asked was whether the ability to imitate had

been exercised in particular instances of behavioural development ( Morgan,

1896, p. 184). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#27:1> Darwin's disciple and immediate intellectual heir in behavioural

matters, George Romanes, was particularly quick to infer that animals were

capable of <quote> " intelligent perception of the desirability of

modification [ in behaviour] on the part of certain individuals and to modify

their actions accordingly" </quote> ( Romanes, 1884, p. 229).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#28:1> According to Romanes ( p. 219), <quote> " with animals as with men,

original ideas are not always forthcoming at the time they are wanted, and

therefore it is often easier to imitate than to invent." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#29:1> Indeed, whenever Romanes ( 1882, 1884) saw evidence of social

influences on learning in animals - whether in groups of newly hatched chicks

learning to drink water, weanling lambs avoiding ingestion of toxic plants,

or the acquisition of responses by birds of one species to the warning cries

of another - he attributed the adaptive modifications of behaviour he

described to learning by imitation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#30:1> When a cat, resident in Romanes's household, learned to open the

garden gate by jumping up and grabbing hold of the latchguard with one

forepaw, depressing the thumb piece with the other, and simultaneously

kicking at the gate post with her hind legs, Romanes ( 1882) assumed: first,

that the cat had observed humans opening the gate by grasping the handle and

moving the latch, second, that the cat had reasoned <X> <quote> " If a hand

can do it, why not a paw?" </quote> </X> ( Romanes, 1882, p. 422), and,

finally, that the cat, motivated by this insight, had attempted to open the

garden gate and succeeded. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#31:1> Introspection had convinced Romanes ( 1882) that much of human

behaviour was learned by imitation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#32:1> Anthropomorphic inference led Romanes to generalize his

introspections to explain acquisition of novel behaviours by animals, as he

had explained acquisition of novel behaviours by members of his own species,

in terms of learning by imitation ( see Galef, 1988c, for further

discussion). </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#33:1> <h> <it> Constraints on the Study of Animal Learning </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#34:1> In the century since Romanes ( 1882, 1884) published his classic

volumes on comparative psychology, the anthropomorphism so common in

19th-century monographs on animal behaviour has been purged from the

literature.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#35:1> Discussions of animal intentions and intelligent perceptions have

been replaced by analyses in terms of stimuli, responses, and reinforcers.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#36:1> This reductionist approach to the analysis of behaviour, advocated by

Morgan, Thorndike, and Watson, profoundly influenced not only interpretations

of the results of animal learning studies but also their methods and subject

matter.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#37:1> Anecdotal reports of cats and dogs learning complex motor skills by

imitating their masters have been superceded by controlled experiments

analyzing the factors influencing association formation in laboratory

situations.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#38:1> The resultant changes in the focus of studies of animal learning

generally, and of animal social learning particularly, have proven a major

advance.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#39:1> However, as is often the case, progress was not entirely without

cost. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#40:1> The introduction, early in the present century, of experimental

procedures for investigating association formation resulted in a precipitous

shift in the subject matter of animal development studies.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#41:1> Interest in the development of behaviours exhibited by animals

outside the laboratory ( the centre of attention since the time of Aristotle)

waned.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#42:1> Conversely, study of laboratory situations in which abstract

processes of association formation could best be observed and dissected

increased dramatically.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#43:1> This shift in locus of attention had a profound impact on the study

of social learning by animals.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#44:1> Following Thorndike's ( 1898) explicit rejection, on theoretical

grounds, of the possibility of learning by imitation in animals and failure

both by Thorndike ( 1898) and by numerous other laboratory workers ( see

Holmes, 1911; Warden & Jackson, 1935; and Washburn, 1908 for reviews) to find

convincing evidence of animal imitation, discussions of learning by imitation

gradually disappeared from the behavioural literature.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#45:1> Such discussions were replaced by attempts to analyze instances of

social learning, demonstrated in laboratory situations, as special cases of

either classical or discriminant operant conditioning ( for examples see

Church, 1968; Miller & Dollard, 1941).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#46:1> Study of particular instances of apparent social learning observed

outside the laboratory seemed unnecessary; in time, all instances of

behaviour acquisition, whether individually or socially based, would be

explicable in terms of general laws describing all association formation.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#47:1> Meanwhile, in the world outside the learning laboratory,

ducklings continued to follow their mothers, song birds went on singing their

species-typical songs, and weaning animals continued to choose the same foods

to eat as their more experienced fellows.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#48:1> The psychological community simply didn't pay attention to such

occurrences.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#49:1> Those learning phenomena that could be explained easily within the

framework provided by laboratory learning paradigms received careful study by

numerous investigators.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#50:1> Those instances of animal learning that were more difficult to

assimilate into either of the prevailing laboratory paradigms were largely

ignored.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#51:1> Experimental, animal psychologists lost interest in carrying out

analyses of instances of animal learning observed outside the laboratory, at

least in part because successful study of learning in unconstrained

situations required an approach quite different both from the informal

anthropomorphizing of 19th-century naturalists and from the paradigm-bound

examination of associative processes that dominated the study of animal

learning. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#52:1> <h> <it> An Alternative Zeitgeist </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#53:1> The development by European ethologists of a complementary

framework to that provided by experimental psychology for the study of animal

behaviour, in general, and animal learning, in particular, provided the

background for a resurgence of interest in the study of behaviours that

occurred outside the laboratory.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#54:1> Ethologists studied behaviours exhibited by members of particular

species in interaction with their respective natural environments.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#55:1> Observations of such naturally occurring behaviours served

ethologists as a focus for subsequent developmental, causal, and functional

analyses.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#56:1> Consequently, analyses of the behavioural processes supporting

particular instances of social learning observed in natural circumstances fit

easily into ethologically oriented research programmes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#57:1> Further, ethologists were more eclectic than experimental

psychologists in discussing processes supporting the acquisition of

behaviour; ethologists had no particular commitment to operant or classical

paradigms as explanatory systems; and they felt no compulsion to study animal

learning in situations where it might occur <quote> " free from the helping

hand of instinct" </quote> ( Thorndike, 1911, p. 30).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#58:1> On the contrary, ethologists treated learning as an adjunct to

instinctive behavioural sequences ( Tinbergen, 1951). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#59:1> Although ethologists both promoted analyses of the development of

behaviours observed in uncontrolled environments and maintained an eclectic

approach to the study of behaviour acquisition, they lacked a tradition of

sophistication and rigour in the analysis of behavioural development, in

general, and of animal learning, in particular.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#60:1> Of course, experimental psychologists had spent decades developing

techniques that ethology lacked for the study of acquisition processes in

animals.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#61:1> Hence, by the mid-1960s, the elements of a hybrid <it>

ethopsychological </it> framework were available that permitted focus on the

question of how naturally occurring behaviours might develop and that

provided methods needed to arrive at satisfying answers.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#62:1> In particular, the question of how animals might use information

acquired from others to guide their own behaviour in adaptive directions, a

question that, at least implicitly, had been perplexing scientists for the

better part of 2 centuries, was finally open to systematic investigation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#63:1> The issue was no longer whether animals could imitate, but, rather,

how one individual might use the behaviour of others to bias its own

development in appropriate directions ( Galef, 1989d). </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#64:1> <h> PART 2: A PROGRAMME OF RESEARCH </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#65:1> For the past 20 years, my co-workers and I have been studying the

role of social interaction in the development of adaptive patterns of food

selection by Norway rats ( <foreign> <it> Rattus norvegicus </it> </foreign> ) .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#66:1> The immediate goal of this research programme has been to determine

the behavioral processes that cause one rat to direct its feeding behaviour

towards the same foods that others of its social group are eating and ignore

potential foods that others of its social group are not eating.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#67:1> Equally important, we hoped to develop a general approach to studies

of social learning that would be of use to future investigators of analogous

behavioral phenomena. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#68:1> My co-workers and I began, as any ethologist would, with field

observations of a possible case of social learning.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#69:1> We brought the behavioral phenomenon observed in the field into the

laboratory and, as any psychologist would, then tried to determine under

controlled conditions how one animal influenced another's behaviour. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#70:1> <h> <it> Problems Poisoning Norway Rats </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-011#71:1> More than 40 years ago, an applied ecologist who was an expert in

the control of Norway rats discovered that when he used a single poison bait

in a rat-infested area for several months, despite initial success, later

acceptance of the bait was negligible.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-011#72:1> As might be expected, many members of the target population died as

the result of eating the poisoned bait. </p> </I>
