<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-069#1:2:A> Now all these pictures that you <,> have <unclear> two words

</unclear> to take into the jury room
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#2:2:A> When <@> Frank </@> was arrested uh on the early morning hours of

<@> November the second </@> nineteen ninety-two uh he was instructed by

myself shortly after his release uh later on that day to get into a <unclear>

three words </unclear> have pictures of his hands <?> done knowing what the

</?> allegations were against him
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#3:2:A> Now the pictures of the hands ladies and gentlemen will
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#4:2:A> And I <unclear> word </unclear> unfortunately I don't have copies

<?> of them but </?> I'd like to show you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#5:2:A> This picture on the front shows <@> Frank's </@> two hands taken

from <}> <-> a </-> <=> a </=> </}> position above <unclear> two words

</unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#6:2:A> You can see on his right hand there appears to be a well-healed cut
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#7:2:A> This picture was taken about thirty-six hours after uhm <@> Frank

</@> was arrested <unclear> rest of utterance </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#8:2:A> It's dated on the <@> third </@> <?> I understand </?> about nine

o'clock <unclear> a few words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#9:2:A> That scar even according to Constable <@> Driscoll </@> was

well-healed <unclear> word </unclear> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#10:2:A> It wasn't fresh
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#11:2:A> It wasn't bleeding at all
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#12:2:A> And <,> the only comment that Constable <@> Driscoll </@> had was

with respect to another small <,> uh red mark or a nick <unclear> maybe three

words </unclear> which you can see in the last picture <,> ladies and

gentlemen next to or approximately half an inch <,> from the well-healed cut
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#13:2:A> <}> <-> It's very </-> <=> It's sometimes </=> </}> difficult to

pick up exactly <}> <-> what </-> <=> what </=> </}> that is but <}> <-> it

</-> <=> it </=> </}> <}> <-> is </-> <=> appears to be </=> </}> a red mark

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#14:2:A> Didn't draw blood
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#15:2:A> <unclear> sentence </unclear> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#16:2:A> Now <,> it's important to look at these pictures when you assess

whether or not <@> Frank Wasylesko </@> had punched <@> Raoul Eto </@> in

that back hallway or punched anybody throughout <}> <-> this uh this </-> <=>

the </=> </}> encounter in the washroom area all the way through to the back

room
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#17:2:A> Firstly <,> that little scar the one he had before the well-healed

one hasn't split open <?> you'll recall </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#18:2:A> Secondly <,> <}> <-> none of his </-> <=> there are </=> </}> no

other bruises or indications of lacerations or abrasions on any of his

knuckles left or right hand except that little tiny red <?> nick </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#19:2:A> If he was <?> sitting </?> there punching <@> Raoul </@> as <@>

Raoul Eto </@> suggests one would think <,> that there would be open cuts <,>

or bruises or abrasions on one or more of his knuckles
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#20:2:A> Now if he is right-handed
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#21:2:A> I don't know if that's <unclear> a few words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#22:2:A> <unclear> sentence </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#23:2:A> Even if he was left-handed uh there's nothing to indicate on either

hand that there's such a <unclear> word </unclear> and that cut <}> <-> is

not </-> <=> uh is not </=> </}> split open at all
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#24:2:A> Now <,,> if <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> you <?> have to <?>

picture the back <?> hall </?> <@> Raoul Eto </@> <}> <-> is </-> <=> is </=>

</}> lying down as I understand the evidence <,> and he suggests that he was

kicked <,> kicked and punched
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#25:2:A> Constable <@> Reif </@> has a pool of blood
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#26:2:A> Not splattered on the wall <,> not splattered on the floor but a

pool <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#27:2:A> <@> Herbert Wasylesko's </@> evidence is that yes there was a pool

<unclear> maybe three words </unclear> dripping from <@> Raoul Eto </@> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#28:2:A> <}> <-> And <unclear> word </unclear> </-> <=> And <unclear> word

</unclear> </=> </}> <unclear> maybe four words </unclear> <@> Raoul </@> was

brought in <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> brought out
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#29:2:A> Why is there no blood <,> at all <,> on the sole or <}> <-> on </->

<=> on </=> </}> the top of the shoe of <@> Frank Wasylesko </@> not even a

<unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#30:2:A> One would think that if <@> Frank Wasylesko </@> was even holding

him down <,> while other people were kicking him <,> there's going to be

splatters somewhere <,> on the wall or <?> on the floor </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#31:2:A> There's <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> be splatters on

the shoe
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#32:2:A> There's <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> be some objective

evidence which would point to what <@> Raoul Eto </@> is saying
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#33:2:A> People would've walked at or near or in that pool of blood and

there'd be footprints of blood <unclear> word </unclear> but there isn't
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#34:2:A> There is absolutely no evidence <,> that that pool of blood is

disturbed in any way
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#35:2:A> <?> It would have to have been </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#36:2:A> <unclear> word </unclear> that <@> Raoul Eto </@> <}> <-> is </->

<=> is </=> </}> getting beaten as he suggested he was <,> there has to be

some indication <,> <unclear> one or two words </unclear> spread out <,> that

<}> <-> <?> there was <?> </-> <=> somebody had walked in </=> </}> <?> it

</?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#37:2:A> Constable <@> Reif </@> <,> saw except for that pool of blood

nothing <?> else </?> <,> nothing else which would indicate at all <,> uhm

<}> <-> that </-> <=> the </=> </}> fact that there had been this big uh

beating going on in the back room
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#38:2:A> Certainly when he goes in <,> he goes in because <@> Raoul Eto </@>

<unclear> three words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#39:2:A> <unclear> sentence </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#40:2:A> Now <,,> here's another <?> interesting thought </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#41:2:A> <@> Raoul Eto </@> suggests <,> that <@> Charles </@> <,> is being

kicked only in the midsection
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#42:2:A> Not in the face <,> not in the upper chest area not in the legs but

in the midsection <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#43:2:A> Can't he cover himself up with his <?> arms </?> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#44:2:A> Is it not more <unclear> maybe two words </unclear> <?> curious <?>

<,> that <@> Charles' </@> fresh cut the one that he had recently <?>

stitched <?> on his arm <?> physically still healing </?> by the way <,>

<unclear> a few words </unclear> had not been reinjured <unclear> a few words

</unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#45:2:A> <unclear> quite a few words </unclear> there's no bruising on the

arm
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#46:2:A> And in fact <@> Raoul Eto </@> had suggested that one of the groups

had actually <?> hit his arm </?> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#47:2:A> <unclear> two words </unclear> no evidence whatsoever of bruising

on <@> Charles Montebank's </@> arms or back at that particular <unclear> a

few words </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#48:2:A> Is it not <unclear> two words </unclear> very convenient that <@>

Raoul Eto </@> had suggested that <@> Charles </@> is only being kicked

<unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#49:2:A> <@> Raoul's </@> getting it from everywhere <?> according to

himself </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#50:2:A> He was getting <?> kicked </?> in the head the back of the head the

upper shoulder area but <@> Charles </@> <,> is only getting kicked <,> in

the stomach <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#51:2:A> Is he suggesting <unclear> three words </unclear> to you that <@>

Charles </@> was complaining about a stomach problem and therefore they would

<?> kick on him </?> in that area <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#52:2:A> I suggest it's very convenient that <@> Raoul Eto </@> suggests <,>

that <@> Charles </@> was being kicked in that area because ultimately it was

shown that <@> Charles </@> had a pancreas problem <,> and it's easy to <?>

say he was kicked there </?> but there's no evidence of kicking anywhere else
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#53:2:A> There's no evidence of bruising on the ribs <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#54:2:A> There's no evidence of bruising in the upper chest area
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#55:2:A> And I already covered that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#56:2:A> There's no evidence of bruising on the <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#57:2:A> There's evidence of <,> some marks on his shoulder and I believe

some indication that he might have had <,> the next day have developed a

black eye
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#58:2:A> That's it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#59:2:A> There's no evidence otherwise of any kicks or abrasions <}> <-> or

</-> <=> or </=> </}> bruising to the body <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#60:2:A> Does that indicate
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#61:2:A> <?> Why is there no </?> evidence
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#62:2:A> <unclear> maybe three words </unclear> rely on what <@> Raoul Eto

</@> says to the police
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#63:2:A> He's <unclear> word </unclear> beaten up <unclear> two words

</unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#64:2:A> The police are already there
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#65:2:A> The police are there
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#66:2:A> <}> <-> They can </-> <=> they can </=> </}> secure it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#67:2:A> If I was being beaten up <unclear> a few words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#68:2:A> Would I not be up on my feet and saying <}> <-> this </-> <=> these

</=> </}> guys beat me up him him and him
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#69:2:A> Nothing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#70:2:A> Nothing's said <,> at all
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#71:2:A> <@> Raoul </@> left <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#72:2:A> Why doesn't <@> Reif </@> notice <@> Charles Montebank </@> <,>

bent over complaining about his stomach <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#73:2:A> There's no indication that <@> Reif </@> <unclear> three words

</unclear> no indication that <@> Reif </@> noticed anything untoward about

<@> Charles Montebank </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#74:2:A> Heck no indication that he even paid any attention to <@> Charles

Montebank </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#75:2:A> <@> Charles Montebank's </@> not complaining about his stomach
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#76:2:A> He's not yelling at the cops at all
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#77:2:A> He's not yelling at <@> Reif </@> saying come help me my stomach's

hurt or these guys hit me in my stomach <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#78:2:A> This I suggest ladies and gentlemen is not <,> uhm <,> <}> <-> it

it </-> <=> it's </=> </}> not consistent with anything going on in the

hallway </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-069#79:3:A> And if they fail <?> ed </?> <,> to prove the guilt of him

beyond a reasonable doubt then you must acquit
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#80:3:A> I'm now going to deal with <@> Peter </@> <,> <unclear> four or

five words </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#81:3:A> If you accept his evidence <?> in support </?> <}> <-> of </-> <,>

<=> of </=> </}> the defence and all the other testimonies <unclear> four or

five words </unclear> <,> that the sexual assault I E having anal intercourse

with <@> Sarah </@> did not take place <,> you must return a verdict of not

guilty <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#82:3:A> If you do not accept the evidence <?> in support </?> of the

defence <unclear> maybe a word </unclear> sexual assault did not take place

but you are left in reasonable doubt by it <,> then you must also return a

verdict of not guilty even if you are only <unclear> two or three words

</unclear> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#83:3:A> And again <,> what I said <unclear> word </unclear> <@> Roger </@>

is <?> equally </?> applicable <,> even if you are not left in a reasonable

doubt by the evidence in support of the defence that the sexual assault did

not take place <,> you must still go on to determine from all the evidence

whether or not <,> the accused is guilty
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#84:3:A> In other words I again remind you that the Crown must in our legal

system prove each and every ingredient of the offence necessary to sustain

the charge beyond a reasonable doubt
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#85:3:A> And if you're satisfied that they have then <unclear> two or three

words </unclear> guilty
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#86:3:A> As I said earlier the Crown must establish the guilt of the accused

<,> to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt and if the Crown failed to

prove [ 47.00] the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt <?> then

you must </?> <,> acquit
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#87:3:A> Now I'm going to deal with the <,> last accused and that becomes a

little more complicated <,> because <}> <-> there was </-> <,> <=> the case

against </=> </}> Mr <,> <@> Childs </@> <unclear> word </unclear> call him

<@> Matthew </@> <,> is that he <unclear> word </unclear> or aided the other

two accused <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#88:3:A> So I will now tell you about the law of aiding and abetting with

respect to <@> Matthew </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#89:3:A> In this case the Crown says that <@> Matthew </@> <,.  <?> is </?>

guilty of the offence <,> because he aided <,> either <@> Roger </@> or <@>

Peter </@> <,> to commit the offence of sexual assault
##YES##
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#90:3:A> Section twenty-one-two of the Criminal Code states that a person

may be convicted as a party to an offence <,> where he or she aids it says

<mention> aids and abets </mention> but <mention> abets </mention> doesn't

apply in this case <,> whether or not <,> he or she aids <,> someone else to

commit the offence
##YES##
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#91:3:A> It is up for you
##YES## to decide whether or not <@> Matthew </@> aided or abbetted either

<@> Roger </@> or <@> Peter </@> <,> in the commission of the offence of

sexual assault <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#92:3:A> Therefore it is my duty to explain the law to you so that you can

make this decision
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#93:3:A> First I will read Section Twenty-one-one in the Criminal Code to

you <,> and I will explain what it means <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#94:3:A> Second I will list the elements the Crown must prove before you are

allowed to convict <,> <@> Matthew </@> [ 48.30] <,> of being a party to the

sexual assault by aiding <,> <@> Roger </@> or <@> Peter </@> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#95:3:A> Section Twenty-one-one of the Criminal Code reads <O> Judge reads

from Criminal Code for approximately fifteen seconds </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#96:3:A> That section is very straightforward <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#97:3:A> It says that a person who actually commits an offence is guilty of

that offence <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#98:3:A> I'll refer to that person who actually commits an offence as the

<,> principal offender <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#99:3:A> In this case the Crown takes the position <,> that <,> <@> Roger

</@> and <@> Peter </@> are the principal <,> offenders <,> and therefore

Section Twenty-one-one B and C are the paragraphs that deal with <,> aid
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#100:3:A> Essentially they say that someone who aids <,> a principal

offender to commit an offence is a party to the offence
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#101:3:A> Under our law a person who is a party to an offence is just as

guilty <,> as the principal offender [ 49.30] <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#102:3:A> That is really what those sections say <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#103:3:A> That if you aid <,> the principal offender <,> and he's guilty <,>

then that person is also guilty <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#104:3:A> I will now tell you the elements that the Crown must prove before

you can find <@> Matthew </@> <,> guilty of sexual assault
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#105:3:A> There are three of them
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#106:3:A> The Crown must prove each of these elements beyond a reasonable

doubt
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#107:3:A> First the Crown must prove that either <,> <@> Roger </@> or <,>

<@> Peter </@> committed the offence of sexual assault
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#108:3:A> If they're both found not guilty then that's the end of the case

<,> as far as <?> uh </?> <,> <@> Matthew </@> is concerned <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#109:3:A> Second the Crown must prove <,> that <@> Matthew </@> did

accompany <,> and this actually aided <,> either <@> Roger </@> or <@> Peter

</@> to commit the offence of sexual assault
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#110:3:A> The evidence in court here the defence evidence is <}> <-> that uh

</-> <,> <=> that uh </=> </}> he didn't do it at all [ 50.30]
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#111:3:A> If you accept that or you have a reason to doubt that he didn't uh

<,> open this girl's legs <,> then that evidence <,> alone you would have to

<,> acquit
#YES#
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#112:3:A> That's <}> <-> if <?> you've <,> ever </?> </-> <=> if you accept

</=> </}> his evidence or you have a reasonable <,> doubt whether he did it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#113:3:A> Third the Crown must prove that <@> Matthew </@> intended <,> that

his act <,> would aid either <@> Roger </@> or <@> Peter </@> to commit the

offence of sexual assault <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#114:3:A> The first element <,> the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable

doubt <,> and I mentioned that before <,> is that either <@> Roger </@> or

<@> Peter </@> committed the offence of sexual assault <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#115:3:A> And <?> of course <}> <-> this is </?> </-> <=> if they haven't

</=> </}> that's the end of the case <}> <-> against </-> <,> <=> against

</=> </}> <@> Matthew </@> and you have to find him not guilty <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#116:3:A> The second element that the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable

doubt is that <@> Matthew </@> <,> did something <,> and that act <,>

actually
##NOT Rep/incomplete+complete## <,> aided either <@> Roger </@> or <@> Peter

</@> <,> to commit sexual <,> assault <,,> [ 51.40]
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#117:3:A> Now the word <mention> aid </mention> has an ordinary English

meaning
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#118:3:A> That means <mention> to <,> help </mention> <,> or <mention>

assist </mention>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#119:3:A> There are a number of ways in which a person can help or assist

another to commit an offence <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-069#120:3:A> For example <,> the aider <,> can supply the principal offender

with the instruments needed for committing the offence </I>
