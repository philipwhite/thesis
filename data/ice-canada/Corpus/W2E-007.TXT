<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#1:1> <h> <bold> <it> And then there are the people who make you sing for

supper </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#2:1> Boy!
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#3:1> Did I have a treat!
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#4:1> It was all kindness of our Chinese alumni in Toronto who invited me to

dinner.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#5:1> It wasn't just any dinner, mind you.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#6:1> It was the 1994 version of the annual Concordia Toronto Chinese Alumni

Association's New Year's ban <l> quet, this year celebrating the Year of the

Dog.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#7:1> I was just the teensiest bit nervous about the whole thing, mainly

because, right there, in black-and-white on the invitation, was the terrify

<l> ing word <mention> " karaoke." </mention> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#8:1> But that word appeared after the promise of a 10-course Chinese

meal at a fine restaurant in deepest Scarbor <l> ough.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#9:1> Gluttony overcame potential embarassment and I accepted the

assignment. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#10:1> I was picked up by Toronto chapter President Marty Ginsherman (

BA 76) and then had the pleasure of meeting his charming wife Debbie Lean (

MA 85, PhD 87).
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#11:1> She's one of the peo <l> ple known for actually standing up and

singing when the karaoke heats up - and for doing it well. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#12:1> We joined about 60 Toronto-area alumni, mostly Chinese, in a

small banquet hall glamourously outfitted for the event.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#13:1> I met Daniel Chan ( BComm 78, BA 85) who is president of the Toronto

Chinese alumni.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#14:1> His organizational skills were evident every <l> where, as was his

small and delightful daughter.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#15:1> Chan told me the group has a list of 140 members.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#16:1> For the first time, he said, Concordia grads at the New Year's

banquet outnumbered Loyola and Sir George alumni. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#17:1> The meal was all exotic dishes like shark's fin soup with

isinglass and dried scallops, broiled crab-clams, and Chinese longevity

noodles.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#18:1> Ten courses was no lie, and every one spec <l> tacular. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#19:1> Florence Yaffe ( S BA 61) and Nor <l> man Poon ( BComm 85) were

emcees for the evening and, with the able assistance of Florence Lee ( BComm

82) kept things rolling with plenty of prize drawings and, of course, the

karaoke. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#20:1> Toronto chapter Past President John Monroe ( BCompSci 79) did a

turn with Lean, a sterling performance of the <w> Carpenters' </w> <it> On

Top of the World </it> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#21:1> Any number of people got up to perform solos, duets or group num

<l> bers.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#22:1> And, by golly, some of them were really good! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#23:1> A raffle of an original painting by Bernice Kwong ( S BSc 57) and

two tickets to <it> Miss Saigon </it> closed the evening.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#24:1> All told, it was a wonderful experience with a great bunch of peo <l>

ple - one I'd be happy to repeat. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#25:1> Oh, I suppose you want to know if I got brave and sang.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#26:1> Only the Toronto alumni know for sure.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#27:1> And I'm swear <l> ing them to secrecy. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#28:1> <h> <bold> On another note... </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#29:1> I'd like to take this opportunity to mention a couple of people

who've been pitching in and making my life a lot easier.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#30:1> Mark Cohen and Sara Iwaasa are two students in the gradu <l> ate

diploma program in journalism.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#31:1> For this and the previous issue, they have been contributing time and

writ <l> ing as student interns. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#32:1> Cohen is responsible for most of the news stories in this issue -

you'll recognize his works from the - MC at their ends - and for the story on

the Toronto phonathon.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#33:1> Sara was co-author with me of the story on initia <l> tives by and

for First Nations students. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#34:1> I commend them for their hard work, excellent writing and

reporting skills, and for being there when I needed them. </p> </I>

<I>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#37:2> <h> <bold> <it> School of second chance should be proud of the

moniker </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#38:2> My elementary school had a very spe <l> cial class called the

Opportunity Class.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#39:2> When we finished Grade 6, most of us were sent on plodding through

the regu <l> lar classes all the way to graduation, mar <l> riage, children,

a mortgage and the wretchedness of being an adult.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#40:2> But certain ones were plucked from us and sent off to the Opportunity

Class.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#41:2> It was sold to them as something quite wonderful; but the name didn't

fool us and it didn't fool them.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#42:2> The teachers could call it whatever they liked.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#43:2> All of us kids knew that entering that class had nothing to do with

opportunity.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#44:2> We called it the Bo Bo Class. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#45:2> I've no doubt the class was well meant and, certainly, the

teachers were dedicated.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#46:2> Yet, there was surely something terribly wrong in branding an

11-year-old child for life as someone who could not cope with any education

beyond the most elementary level.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#47:2> The door that stayed open for the rest of us slammed loudly and

slammed forever in their faces.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#48:2> Though we couldn't know it at the time, that was when our schooling

ceased to be education and became just a screening process. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#49:2> Oh sure, there are some children who have learning problems so

serious that we can't do much for them within a regular program.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#50:2> But I knew those kids we dropped off like unwanted baggage at the

Opportunity Class.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#51:2> I played with them.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#52:2> There was nothing more seriously wrong with most of them than lack of

the sort of home surrounding that would have made them good students.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#53:2> They needed a chance, not a label. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#54:2> I guess that doesn't matter any more.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#55:2> They were sifted through the screen and they fell through to the

ground and there they lay while we were shovelled onto the next layer of

screen. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#56:2> I noticed recently that the news services carried a story about

Japanese schools which seem to be doing rather better than ours.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#57:2> The story had the usual reasons - family expectations and school

discipline figured prominently - but they also gave another reason worth

considering.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#58:2> Japan <l> ese schools start with the assumption that all children

have the ability to learn.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#59:2> Think of it.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#60:2> All children have the ability to learn.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#61:2> That's something we should remember when we're sifting through our

students. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#62:2> Sir George Williams was founded on something close to the

principle that every <l> one can learn.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#63:2> It was popularly known in the early days as the school of the second

chance, the one that would take in students who had failed at other

universities or, like me, didn't have the grades to get into one of them in

the first place. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#64:2> Sir George was successful, too.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#65:2> Picking through the ashes of all those rejects, it produced a

remarkable number of doctors, lawyers, teachers and business people - and

that from students other universities had said just weren't up to university

work. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#66:2> When the merger came, Loyola brought its own and very similar

tradition of educa <l> tion to form Concordia.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#67:2> Together, Sir George and Loyola formed a solid base for education,

rather than screening.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#68:2> The question now is, can their common tradi <l> tion survive?
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#69:2> The pressures against it are formidable. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#70:2> Most of that pressure comes from repu <l> tation or, rather, the

search for one.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#71:2> A uni <l> versity needs a solid reputation if it is to be taken

seriously by governments and donors and the general public, and if it is to

attract students.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#72:2> The trouble is that few of those people have much understanding of

what a university does - and rather less of what it should be doing.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#73:2> Given that lack of under <l> standing, it's all too easy to base the

reputa <l> tion on big names associated with the university - in no matter

how remote a past - on star pupils, or simply on the rela <l> tive social

standing of the mummies and daddies of the students. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#74:2> That puts universities under pressure to forget about education

and just concen <l> trate on screening out the weaker students to create the

illusion of high standards.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#75:2> The popular impact of rankings, like that in the annual <it>

Maclean's </it> survey, further discour <l> ages any attempt to place the

needs of peo <l> ple over those of reputation.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#76:2> Based, as they must be, on the assumption that all univer <l> sities

should be alike, rankings actually dis <l> courage the sorts of educational

challenges that universities should be taking up. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#77:2> In short, universities are forced into a race against each other

to build repu <l> tations appealing to ignorance and snobbery. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#78:2> When I was a student at Sir George, I was a snob ( at least some

of my teachers would have added " igno <l> rant").
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#79:2> I was embarrassed at attending the university of the second chance.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#80:2> When relatives asked where I was going, I would mumble.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#81:2> I would have killed to be at a more prestigious school, one whose

name alone would buy me respect. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#82:2> It took me years to learn better.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#83:2> Too bad, as they say, we get too soon old and too late smart.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#84:2> I now realize that, of my degrees, I'm proudest of my BA from Sir

George.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#85:2> I'm proud of having taught at a Loyola that cared about its students.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#86:2> I'm proud to be teaching at Concordia because it still uses the word

<mention> " opportunity" </mention> to mean opening doors rather than closing

them.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#87:2> And I'll stay proud just as long as Concordia holds out against the

pressure to look like all the others. </p> </I>

<I>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#89:3> <h> <bold> <it> Pageantry, pomp and ceremony mark this special rite

of passage </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#90:3> This was the third Concordia convoca <l> tion I had attended.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#91:3> To the first, I went as an observer and sat amongst proud families

and friends of the graduates.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#92:3> To the second, I went as a graduate and sat at the front of the

theatre, awaiting my turn to cross the stage and receive my degree.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#93:3> This time I went as a member of the Concordia staff, sat on stage and

saw our new chancellor take office. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#94:3> We lined up deep in the bowels of Place des Arts.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#95:3> We were arrayed in academic dress running the gamut from basic black

robe with hood to glamorous crea <l> tions in brilliant hues of satin and

velvet, fur-trimmed with matching crush caps - ensembles to make Henry VIII

envious. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#96:3> Once adjusted and tweaked into place, academic dress looks well

on just about anyone provided they maintain a statu <l> esque immobility.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#97:3> We did not, so a deal of twisting, turning and general rustling went

on as gowns were resettled, and as hoods were adjusted, re-adjusted and then

found to have been put on inside out.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#98:3> Still, by the time we processed grandly onto the Salle

Wilfrid-Pelletier stage, we were an impressive group. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#99:3> Before us had gone the graduates, after us came members of the

Board of Governors, visiting dignitaries, honorary degree re <l> cipients

and, finally, the new chancellor. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#100:3> Later, in addressing convocation, Chan <l> cellor Eric Molson

would say that his long-time wish to be back in school had been not only

fulfilled but exceeded - he found himself <quote> " installed." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#101:3> It does sound as though he should have been rolled in on a dolly and

plugged in somewhere.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#102:3> He was, in fact, trumpeted in with much pomp and circumstance.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#103:3> He was sworn in, received his robes and cap, and was greeted by

dignitaries from other univer <l> sities across the country.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#104:3> Sumptuously garbed chancellors, rectors and other representatives of

their institutions stepped forward to congratulate and wel <l> come Molson.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#105:3> Then came the graduates.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#106:3> One after another they climbed the stairs, gave their names and

stepped out onto the stage.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#107:3> I remembered my own convocation of a few months ago, and the mingled

stage-fright and pride which propelled me across that seemingly endless

distance. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#108:3> It's just about impossible to applaud for every graduate - no

matter how willing the spirit, the flesh of arms and hands is simply not up

to the task.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#109:3> It didn't really matter.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#110:3> Most grads seemed to have per <l> sonal cheering sections out there

some <l> where.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#111:3> Whoops and hollers greeted some; one was given a continuous hand of

ap <l> plause - by one pair of hands - through <l> out his transit of the

stage.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#112:3> In the platform party, the professors of each discipline could be

identified as they heartily acknowledged their students.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#113:3> Every so often, someone who had been carefully seated at the end of

the onstage rows would step forward to present a degree - to a son or a

daughter - and I'd watch a hug and hear a soft <quote> " thanks, Mom."

</quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-007#114:3> However light the applause for the undergraduates, it filled the

hall for the PhDs.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#115:3> Each successful candidate was welcomed with an ovation.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-007#116:3> Then, in a gesture I hope is a part of convocations everywhere, the

new PhDs were ushered, not back to their seats, but to seats on the stage

signalling recognition of their achievement and of their new member <l> ship

in the august company of doctors of philosophy. </p> </I>
