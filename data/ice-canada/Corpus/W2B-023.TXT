<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#2:1> <h> <bold> I wonder where the birdies is? </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#3:1> Canadians are an odd and fortunate people.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#4:1> Odd because we spend the better part of every year alternately

steeling ourselves against the winter freeze and rushing out in a whirl of

scarves and hats to embrace the pleasures of the frozen landscape. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#5:1> Fortunate because every year spring follows winter with only

slight irregularity.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#6:1> Invariably, ever warmer breezes, melting snow and mud lead to new

growth.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#7:1> This renewal of life, however, is too often taken for granted, with

little thought given to the consequences that even our most basic actions

have on our natural surroundings.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#8:1> As gardeners, we share the responsibility to contribute to the

well-being of the environment by choosing to work our gardens in a healthy

manner. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#9:1> With the onslaught of green advertising from every sector of our

consumer society, organic gardening methods are undergoing an identity

crisis.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#10:1> In this issue, we've decided to try and put a couple of methods in

perspective.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#11:1> Don Brenneman's report on fertilizers distinguishes between feeding

your plants and feeding your soil, and in no uncertain terms lets you know

which is better for your garden.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#12:1> Ken Taylor provides fruit tree growers with a rundown of how and when

to use dormant oil sprays to control pest problems. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#13:1> Our feature article is bound to take some of the chill out of

winter.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#14:1> In <it> Canada's Greenhouse </it> , Gisele Grignon discovers that one

way to satisfy a craving for the blossoms of summer is to explore the

Governor General's greenhouse at Rideau Hall.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#15:1> There's no pomp and circumstance here, just an 88-acre greenhouse and

garden with a rich tradition and an even more vibrant collection of flowers.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#16:1> <it> Brave New Waves </it> by Michael Spillane is full of what

every gardener is looking for: sound advice on how to grow bigger and

healthier plants.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#17:1> The focus of the article is Sonic Bloom, a plant enhancer that uses

sound frequency together with a nutrient spray to encourage extraordinary

growth.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#18:1> The treatment is available on cassette for home and commercial

gardens.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#19:1> Just imagine the possibilities when it comes out on CD. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#20:1> If you've ever been attracted to the intense beauty and many

guises of the begonia, you owe it to yourself to read Carol Sutton's <it>

Islands of Colour </it> , because if you've grown one begonia, you certainly

haven't grown them all.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#21:1> Something else you may not have grown is the fava bean, a cool

weather legume that has sustained the people of Rome, India and the Middle

East for thousands of years.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#22:1> In <it> Stalking the Exotic Bean </it> , Dan Jason explains why we

should be growing the fava, and gives us a taste of how to do it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#23:1> Randall Prue's <it> Native Delights </it> cuts to the root of

another would-be Middle Eastern vegetable, the Jerusalem artichoke.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#24:1> We've also got an article brimming with tips on how to put together a

user-friendly birdhouse.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#25:1> If that's not enough to keep you busy until spring, keep reading.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#26:1> There's lots more in the magazine.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#27:1> We've even included a list of Canadian sources for seeds and

catalogues, as well as a very important document: our readership survey.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#28:1> Please read the magazine, then take a few minutes to fill in the

survey.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#29:1> We'd like to know who you are, what you enjoy, and what aspects of

gardening in Canada you'd like to know more about. </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#33:2> <h> Like harbingers of spring, a multitude of flowering plants become

available at this time of year.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#34:2> Many are popular a gifts, and all appeal to the plant lover looking

for a splash of colour or a new plant to care for indoors.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#35:2> The following six plants are given as gifts more often than any

others.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#36:2> Whether you're doing the buying or the receiving, it helps to know

what to look for in the store and then how to care for your plant once it's

safely home. </h>

<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#38:2> <h> <bold> <it> Cineraria </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#39:2> Resembling daisies, the cheery cineraria is a profuse bloomer

whose flowers often completely cover the plant's foliage.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#40:2> The flowers come in a wide range of both pastel and brilliant

colours, in pinks, blues, purples and white, and will last up to three weeks.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#41:2> Water your plant regularly; the mound of blossoms will wilt

readily if the soil is allowed to dry out.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#42:2> Cooler temperatures of 19 degrees C maximum and no direct sun will

keep cinerarias happy, and remem <l> ber not to fertilize while they are in

bloom.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#43:2> After flowering the leaves deteriorate rapidly.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#44:2> Because ciner <l> arias are annuals and cannot be reflowered, they

are usually dis <l> carded after blooming. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#45:2> With patience, cinerarias can be grown from seed.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#46:2> Sow by summer and gradually pot up the individual plants.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#47:2> Flower bud initiation occurs during a three-to-four month period

where night temperatures cannot exceed 16 degrees C.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#48:2> If you want to hasten flowering, give your plant long hours of light.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#49:2> Cinerarias and white flies seem to go together, so keep them isolated

from your other plants. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#50:2> <h> <bold> <it> Easter lily </bold> </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#51:2> Easter lilies are gift plants every <l> one loves; the

traditional flower for Easter is the pure white lily, while hybrid lilies in

reds, oranges and yellows are marketed for Mother's Day.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#52:2> When buying, choose a plant with buds to make sure you will have a

long flowering period.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#53:2> Individual blooms will stay attrac <l> tive for two or three weeks.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#54:2> Place your plant in a bright, cool window and water only when the

soil begins to dry.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#55:2> Daytime temper <l> atures of only 16 to 18 degrees C are preferred,

and lilies will benefit by being moved to an even cooler spot at night.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#56:2> It is believed that removing the yellow pollen-bearing anthers from

the center of the flower will help the blooms last longer. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#57:2> Cut off the flowers as they fade.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#58:2> Lilies can't be brought into bloom again indoors as they have already

been forced to flower before their natural season, which is summer.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#59:2> Although lilies are perennial plants, they are unlikely to overwinter

in most areas.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#60:2> Try keeping them in a bright area until they can be safely planted

into a sunny part of the garden where they may bloom again at summer's end

without any special treatment. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#61:2> <h> <bold> <it> Gardenia </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#62:2> For fragrance the gardenia is unsurpassed as an indoor bloomer.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#63:2> The flowers, which may last up to three weeks, give off a heavy

jasmine-like scent and their creamy-white colour contrasts beau <l> tifully

with the glossy, dark green leaves of this woody plant. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#64:2> Gardenias are so fussy about temperature that they disappoint

many would-be growers.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#65:2> During the day keep these sun lovers in maximum light at 21 to 23

degrees C and at night, 16 to 17 degrees C.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#66:2> Warmer daytime temperatures will reduce the development of flower

buds and will encourage buds to drop, and cooler tempera <l> tures during the

night will cause leaves to yellow.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#67:2> Any sudden change in temperature, exposure to drafts or lack of

humidity will also cause the buds to drop. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#68:2> To keep these plants healthy a very high humidity level, much

higher than is normal in most homes, is essential.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#69:2> Also, constant moisture and acid conditions are required.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#70:2> Mist your plant daily or place it on a humidity tray, water as

needed, then water monthly with an acid solution of ammonium sul <l> phate (

one level teaspoon to one liter of water. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#71:2> Gardenias must be in constant growth to be able to bloom freely.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#72:2> Feed routinely ( every two or three weeks) during active growth but

not during the winter months.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#73:2> If you meet the temperature and humidity requirements of your plant,

you will be rewarded with more flowers in the fall and then again in winter.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#74:2> A stretch of cloudy weather may interrupt flowering. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#75:2> <h> <bold> <it> Hydrangea </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#76:2> Hydrangeas can only be found around Easter and Mother's Day.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#77:2> The large, round flower clusters in pastel pink or blue that form at

the top of the plant's woody stems are long lasting, staying showy for one or

two months.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#78:2> Easy to keep, hydrangeas require average temper <l> ature and

humidity and indirect, bright light.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#79:2> Constant moisture is a must, however, or your plant will deteriorate

rapidly.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#80:2> Soil acidity is relatively neutral for pink blooms ( pH 6.2 to 6.5)

while blue hydran <l> geas develop in more acidic condi <l> tions ( pH 4.5 to

5.0). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#81:2> If you're keeping your plant to reflower next year, prune it back

when the flowers have dried up to just above the old wood and water and

fertilize monthly throughout the summer.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#82:2> Buds will form when the plant is kept in a bright spot in

temperatures of below 18 degrees C for six weeks.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#83:2> Further development will occur over the next six weeks ( equal to the

winter dormancy period) if you keep your plant in continuous darkness at

tempera <l> tures of 5 to 7 degrees C.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#84:2> A cold but frost-free garage or cellar is suitable.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#85:2> Hydrangeas can then be brought into bright light and forced into

bloom if kept at 16 degrees C at night and 18 to 21 degrees C during the day

for about three months. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#86:2> <h> <bold> <it> Miniature orange </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#87:2> This citrus plant is everbearing, meaning that it flowers and

sets fruit all year long.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#88:2> Both the flowers, which are sweetly fragrant, and fruit, which can

grow up to 2 inches ( 5 cm) in diameter, can be on the plant at the same

time.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#89:2> The juicy, acidic fruit is edible and can be used in beverages or

when mak <l> ing jam as a substitute for lemons and limes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#90:2> These upright, compact, slow-growing trees demand full sun;

without it the foliage will drop and the formation of blossoms will be

retarded.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#91:2> If sufficient light is not available, miniature oranges can be grown

successfully under fluores <l> cent lights.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#92:2> Room temperatures and humidity should be average.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#93:2> A humus-like, acidic soil that is kept moist but never saturated is

best. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#94:2> During periods of active growth be sure to supply a balanced

all-purpose fertilizer.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#95:2> Spending the summer outside will give them a lift.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#96:2> If flowers fail to develop into fruit, pollinate them yourself using

a child's paintbrush by lifting the yellow pollen from the stamens ( the

thread-like protrusions that are coated in pollen) of one blossom and

brushing it on top of the pistil ( the bulbous protruding part in the

flower's center) of another.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#97:2> Trans <l> plant to a slightly larger pot only when necessary, when

the plant becomes pot bound and there is not enough soil to hold the water.

</p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#98:2> <h> <bold> <it> Miniature rose </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#99:2> Miniature roses, which come in the complete range of rose

colours, are delightful for indoor plant cul <l> ture.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#100:2> You'll find the largest selec <l> tion available just before

Mother's Day.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#101:2> Two of the most common are <it> Rosa chinensis </it> , which doesn't

exceed one foot ( 30 cm) in height and bears single blooms that are half an

inch to an inch ( 1 - 3 cm) across and leaves that are equally small, and the

taller <it> Rosa X polyantha </it> , which produces one- to two-inch ( 3 - 5

cm) blooms in clusters.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#102:2> While some miniatures have a fragrance, many others don't. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#103:2> If provided with maximum light miniature roses will flower

continu <l> ously.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#104:2> If sufficient light can't be provided during the winter months,

place your plant in a cool or unheated well-lit room to give it a rest

period.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#105:2> Miniatures are best suited to average to cool daytime temperatures

and like a nighttime minimum of 10 to 13 degrees C.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#106:2> The soil, which should be kept moist but not wet, should contain

some humus and permit good drainage. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-023#107:2> To encourage bushiness and more abundant winter blooming, put

your plant outdoors for the summer and water and fertilize regularly.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#108:2> Prune to a symmetrical shape in the fall and reduce water <l> ing

until new growth appears.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#109:2> Occasional pruning of the flowering stem will encourage new bud for

<l> mation.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#110:2> Side branches that don't bloom should also be pruned to prompt

branching.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-023#111:2> If your rose is well protected you can plant it per <l> manently in

the garden. </p>
