<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#1:1> Would you please confirm what you said in our telephone

conversation last Friday?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#2:1> If so, please initial and return the attached copy of this memo. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#3:1> 1. Any non-credit course given in a department must be obviously

labelled NON-CREDIT. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#4:1> 2. Students in such courses are covered for physical injury in the

same way as is anyone who comes into university premises for any purpose.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#5:1> No further liability insurance is needed. </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#6:2> From my experience with students in <@> TESL 555 </@> this

semester, I would say that the TESL program is at a <it> crisis point </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#7:2> If the Centre does not want to graduate students whose knowledge of

English is minimal and therefore are a disgrace to the Centre's reputation,

two things must be done: </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#8:2> 1. Test all students for competence in written and spoken English

before accepting them.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#9:2> This is not difficult or expensive.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#10:2> I could help make an easily corrected written test, and oral

interviews for all serve many purposes besides testing for linguistic

competence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#11:2> 2. If students with low levels of English must be accepted,

require them to take a special ESL course designed for TESL teachers and

taught by someone who has been given special instructions.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#12:2> One of the regular ESL classes will <it> not </it> do. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#13:2> Here are a few samples of writing from this year's <@> TESL 555

</@> class. <X> <quote> They meat their family. </quote> <quote> They were

meet at the station. </quote> <quote> There are planny examples. </quote>

<quote> There is good rithme. </quote> <quote> The homework are clear.

</quote> <quote> You gived us that. </quote> <quote> The tests should be less

harder. </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#14:2> On another topic, I think you should find out <}> <-> form </->

<+> from </+> </}> the <@> ABCDE </@> and the <@> CCDD </@> what their rules

are about hiring people with medical conditions, and then these rules should

be at least considered as part of the TESL admissions policies. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#15:2> To reduce the matter to absurdity, should the Centre accept a

quadriplegic for training as a classroom teacher? </p> </I>


<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#16:3> Dear Mrs. <@> Hole </@> , </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#17:3> I am writing to refer to you <@> Linda Hart-Jones </@> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#18:3> <@> Linda </@> was a student in a grammar class I taught and I

have seen her since when she was a volunteer ESL teacher at <@> Langdale

St-Jacques Community Centre </@> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#19:3> <@> Linda </@> showed herself to be a good student, with an

enquiring mind.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#20:3> She has travelled and has had a variety of experiences, all of which

gives depth to her knowledge.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#21:3> In my opinion, she would be an excellent graduate student. </p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#22:4> <h> Re: Testing for Language Proficiency </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#23:4> I would just like to repeat that we should make our own <ul>

short </ul> , <ul> easily corrected criterion-referenced </ul> English

language test based on our perceived needs of a graduate of a TESL program.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#24:4> Further, 1) the test should not be an ESL test.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#25:4> 2) The criteria for passing must be English language competence, not

success at university or success as a teacher.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#26:4> 3) The test should permit diagnosis, as well as selection.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#27:4> 4) Composing skill is taught in <@> Engl 551 / 552 </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#28:4> We don't need to test for it at entry.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#29:4> 5) The test must be a direct, not an indirect, measure.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#30:4> 6) The evaluation of the measure must be based on criteria (

<foreign> sine qua non </foreign> ) we set up, not norm referencing.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#31:4> [ Prof. <@> Bill Bailey </@> points out that criteria are based on

<ul> past </ul> norm referencing anyway]
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#32:4> 7) It has to be proven that computer scoring of an objective test is

any more efficient than on-the-spot assessment. </p> </I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#33:5> This is all I received from <@> Notary Aman </@> yesterday. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#34:5> I asked him for a copy of the document from the city which must

be signed at the same time as the deed of sale.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#35:5> He did not send it, even though <@> M. Tremblay </@> of Habitation

Montreal sent him the basics for making the document. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#36:5> When I went to see you, I asked you to circle June 22 on your

calendar, asking you to come to the signing.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#37:5> I also put it in writing.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#38:5> So - - - please make time.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#39:5> I would like to see you about 2:15, then leave for the " ceremony".
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#40:5> I would take you there and back in a taxi. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#41:5> P.S. I attach my fax ( copy) to him - dated today. </p> </I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#47:6> This is an answer to the attached letter. </p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#48:7> <h> To whom it may concern: </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#49:7> I am very pleased to write this letter of recommendation on

behalf of <bold> Mr. <@> Giovanni Grillo </@> </bold> , whom I have known for

the last three years in my capacity of Dean, Faculty of Engineering and

Computer Science. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#50:7> <@> Giovanni </@> recently graduated from the Mechanical

Engineering programme, obtaining a B.Eng. ( Design and Manufacturing Option)

degree.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#51:7> From all accounts he was a solid student who, while not always

earning the best marks, consistently impressed with his effort, dedication,

conscientiousness, and sense of responsibility and purpose.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#52:7> His degree is well earned. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#53:7> Throughout his studies here <@> Giovanni </@> did much to

contribute to the quality of life of his fellow students.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#54:7> As President of the Mechanical Engineering Student Association during

the 1995-96 academic year, he was responsible for organizing numerous events

and activities which, owing to his organizational and interpersonal skills,

typically proved to be highly successful.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#55:7> These included such endeavours as arranging for students tours in

industry and organizing the annual Mechanical Engineering dinner for

students, faculty, and industry representatives. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#56:7> In the Winter 1995 semester <@> Giovanni </@> assumed a number of

duties in the Faculty's Computer Graphics Laboratory, providing fundamental

software maintenance on that facility's workstations as well as instructional

assistance to its student users.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#57:7> As conveyed to me recently by his immediate supervisor, he was always

punctual, prompt, cooperative, and well liked by those who came in contact

with him, and performed very well all the tasks assigned to him. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#58:7> On the basis of my contacts with <@> Giovanni </@> and from what

I know about him from others, he has always conducted himself in a very

responsible, honest, and capable manner.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#59:7> Should you require any additional information about him, please do

not hesitate to contact me. </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#60:8> I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation on behalf of

<@> Tania Di Souza </@> who has applied for admission to the Diploma in

Educational Technology. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#61:8> <@> Tania </@> was a student in two of my courses, i.e., <it>

Propaganda, and Media and Cultural Context </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#62:8> In both courses, she proved to be a diligent, keen, intelligent and

insightful student.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#63:8> She participated well in class discussions and was also a valued team

member in the major team project undertaken for the course in <it> Media and

Cultural Context </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#64:8> She attended class regularly and submitted her assignments on time.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#65:8> I was especially impressed with her great sense of organization,

her ability to do extensive research and to be able then to analyze it and

present it in a critical fashion in her term papers and final exams. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#66:8> <@> Tania </@> has had the opportunity to work since her

graduation and I believe that her professional experience will make her

return to university even more fruitful, both for herself and her classmates.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#67:8> I have no doubt that she posseses the intelligence, determination

and interest necessary to complete the Diploma Program successfully.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#68:8> She is an excellent individual who will be a pleasant and valuable

asset to your program.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#69:8> I recommend <@> Tania Di Souza </@> for acceptance without hesitation

and I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have. </p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#70:9> <h> To the Admissions Committee: </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#71:9> I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation for Ms. <@>

Patricia Ann Grier </@> in support of her application to the M.A. in

Journalism ( Public Relations) program at the University of <@> Anneville

</@> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#72:9> I have known <@> Patricia </@> for the past two years and more

specifically since she was a student in a Seminar in Propaganda which I

taught in the Fall 1995 semester in <@> Collegial </@> 's Communication

Studies program.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#73:9> This program is a leader of its kind in North America, has very high

standards, and accepts only students with strong academic credentials. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#74:9> While <@> Patricia </@> 's academic record may be surpassed by

others, it is nevertheless quite solid.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#75:9> In class I found her to be mature, articulate, possessing strong

background knowledge and critical skills, enthusiasm and determination.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#76:9> All of these attributes are of course essential for performing well

at the graduate level and I cannot think of any limitations, intellectual or

other, that would prevent <@> Patricia </@> from being successful in that

setting. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#77:9> In addition to possessing quite pertinent academic background and

the above described abilities, through her employment <@> Patricia </@> has

already acquired a measure of hands-on experience and knowledge about the

field of public relations.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#78:9> In addition, she has travelled abroad and exposed herself to

different cultures and living contexts - an indication that she is not afraid

of novelty or taking up the challeges of new initiatives.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#79:9> I strongly believe these points merit highlighting in the

consideration of her candidacy for entering this graduate program. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#80:9> In closing, I recommend Ms. <@> Grier </@> to you highly and

trust the Admissions Committee will give her application serious

consideration.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#81:9> Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate

to contact me. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#82:9> Yours sincerely, </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#83:10> I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation for Ms. <@>

Maria D'Rossi </@> in support of her application to the Master in Business

Administration program at the University of <@> Capitale </@> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#84:10> I have known <@> Maria </@> since Summer 1993 in my capacity as

Dean of the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science, while she was

pursuing her studies in Electrical Engineering.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#85:10> As she was on the executive of the Engineering and Computer Science

Student Association ( ECA), we met frequently on issues related to student

life. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#86:10> While <@> Maria </@> 's academic record may be surpassed by

others, she is mature, articulate, well-organized, and possesses strong

critical skills ( it is noteworthy that she did her best academic work in

seminars and report writing courses).
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#87:10> All of these attributes are of course essential for performing well

at the graduate level and I cannot think of any limitations, intellectual or

other, that would prevent her from being successful in that setting. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#88:10> As Vice-President ( External) of the ECA in 1994-95, <@> Maria

</@> made key contributions not only to the students of the association but

to the Faculty as a whole, being an able ambassador for us with the outside

community.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#89:10> For example, she was the principal organizer of the very successful

Engineers of Tomorrow Conference which annually exposes dozens of <@>

Smallville </@> - area elementary and high-school students to the discipline

of engineering.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#90:10> Beyond the strict coordination of the event itself, the latter also

involved the preparation of a budget, solicitation of funding sponsorships,

and addressing publicly the participants. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#91:10> As the ECA representative to the <indig> Comit&eacute; des

facult&eacute;s d'ing&eacute;nierie du Qu&eacute;bec </indig> , <@> Maria

</@> was also active at the provincial interuniversity level, in which

context she truly excelled by exhibiting very strong interpersonal and

leadership skills. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#92:10> In closing, I recommend Ms. <@> D'Rossi </@> to you highly and

trust the admissions committee will give her application serious

consideration.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#93:10> Should you require any additional information, please do not

hesitate to contact me. </p> </I>


<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#94:11> Dear <@> Amy </@> , </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#95:11> I wonder if it is possible to obtain a larger space at <@>

Anneville </@> for <@> Mary Gauntlet </@> , more specifically, AD-221.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#96:11> The space was formerly occupied by <@> Brandon Danes </@> , and

before that by <@> Mary </@> herself.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#97:11> There are in fact two offices, one for her and another which would

serve for meetings of the various committees of the association and also for

storage of the rather voluminous supplies, prizes, and artifacts, with which

she is presently attempting to deal.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#98:11> This space would also be ideal as it is close to Security,

particularly in view of the memorabilia with which we are being entrusted.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#99:11> I am suggesting this in view of the extended responsibilities

she has taken on in regard to the 60th Anniversary celebrations and also for

the auxiliary projects.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#100:11> <@> Jake Meisel/@> is in agreement with me on this; he is of course

very aware of the amount of space required storage for the activities of the

<@> Anneville </@> Association.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#101:11> I am going to suggest to <@> James </@> that the <@> Anneville </@>

people might be prepared to give her a rather more effective printer than her

vintage model she is currently coaxing along. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#102:11> Yours sincerely, </p> </I>


<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#103:12> Dear Dean <@> Pandekis </@> , </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#104:12> Thank you for your letter of March 20th regarding alumni

support for the Faculty of Arts and Science.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#105:12> Certainly, our Association is always conscious of the needs of the

university and its students, and is actively attempting to find new ways in

which it can be helpful to the institution.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#106:12> Currently, for example, we are engaged in studying the feasibility

of setting up various volunteer-staffed auxiliary services, with a project to

enhance <@> Collegial </@> 's services for disabled students scheduled for

September 1996 start-up. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#107:12> On behalf of the <@> Sir Tom Jones' </@> University Alumni, I

would like to invite you to our Annual General Meeting and hope that you

would be prepared to share your ideas of how best we can serve the

university.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-030#108:12> The meeting will be held in H-762 on May 21st, beginning at 6:00

p.m. and followed by a reception at 7:00 p.m. in the Faculty Club Lounge.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-030#109:12> Please let me know if this is convenient to you. </p> </I>
