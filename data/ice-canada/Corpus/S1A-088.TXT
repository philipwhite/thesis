</@> <}> <-> has er </-> <=> had </=> </}> agreed <,> to boycott <,> <?> the

<,> owners of the golf course because they reneged on the decision
<ICE-CAN:S1A-088#190:1:B> And this little boy's been campaigning he and his <,> parents have

been campaigning now for two years

the decision </=> </}> so <O> munching </O> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-088#192:1:B> I think the mayor vetoed the decision or something so <}> <->

there's </-> <=> there was </=> </}> a lot of controversy over that but

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-088#202:1:A> <[> Mm </[> </{>

<,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-088#204:1:A> Yeah
<ICE-CAN:S1A-088#205:1:A> I'm afraid I'm guilty of that

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-088#206:1:B> <O> munching </O>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-088#207:1:B> <?> Like with </?> the lawn hose the Weed and Feed

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-088#208:1:B> Well <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-088#209:1:B> That's much more controllable <,> than <}> <-> this <.> spra </.>

</-> <=> the spray </=> </}> that the commercial <,> people come <{> <[> <,>

</[> and do

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-088#210:1:A> <[> Mm hmm </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-088#211:1:B> You ever watch them they spray a lot of stuff <O> munching

</O>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-088#212:1:B> Whereas most people if they're using just the Weed and Feed or

Killex <,> they spray directly on to <,> the affected area <,> and that's it

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-088#213:1:A> <O> munching </O>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-088#214:1:B> These people spray a lot and they don't seem to take into

<,> better

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-088#218:1:B> Mm hmm
<ICE-CAN:S1A-088#219:1:B> <,,> Yeah I know

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-088#221:1:A> But the weeds are awful on our <,> lawn I mean
<ICE-CAN:S1A-088#222:1:A> And we've been putting grass seed and <,,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-088#223:1:B> <}> <-> <.> We </.> </-> <+> Well </+> </}> the weeds are

very bad on our lawn too and they have been <,> for some time because the <,>

fellow who owned the house before us <,> didn't really do anything
<ICE-CAN:S1A-088#224:1:B> <,> And uhm <,> in fact he didn't even cut the grass

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-088#225:1:A> Uh oh

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-088#226:1:B> Cos I can remember driving by and seeing the grass <,,> <O>
