<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#1:1> <h> A DISCOURAGING WORD: Diseased bison trigger a stormy debate </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-027#2:1> Almost 60 million of the majestic animals once roamed the forests

and flatlands of North America.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#3:1> But European settlers brought a brutal end to that era when they

killed off nearly all of the continent's bison.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#4:1> By 1885, fewer than 1,000 remained.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#5:1> Now, the world's largest free-ranging herd consists of an estimated

4,000 bison ( the animals are widely, but erroneously, referred to as

buffalo) that live under federal protection in northern Alberta.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#6:1> But until last week, when federal cabinet ministers intervened with a

promise to look for alternatives, the bison seemed destined for mass

slaughter.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#7:1> The drastic measure was proposed by a federally appointed panel that

said that many of the bison are dangerously diseased. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-027#8:1> The recommendation to systematically exterminate the entire herd

in Wood Buffalo National Park created a storm of controversy over Canadian

wildlife policy.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#9:1> If, as the Aug. 29 federal report said, at least half of the bison are

carrying tuberculosis or brucellosis ( a disease that causes pregnant bison

to abort), they might infect other wild bison.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#10:1> Also at risk are domestic cattle, which come into contact with bison

that often wander outside the park.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#11:1> Brucellosis spreads when animals graze in pastures contaminated by

the afterbirth of ailing female bison.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#12:1> Tuberculosis can spread to other animals by airborne contact or

through tainted water.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#13:1> Agriculture officials said that the epidemic could arouse U.S.

suspicions about Canadian beef, forcing Ottawa to spend millions of dollars

on inspection tests. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-027#14:1> As a result, some federal officials say that the bison should be

slaughtered.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#15:1> But the proposal led to widespread protests by naturalists and native

groups, who claimed that there was not sufficient proof of widespread illness

among the animals.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#16:1> As the controversy deepened, Environment Minister Robert de Cotret

came to the <w> animals' </w> rescue.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#17:1> <quote> " I don't think the solution is to go out and shoot,"

</quote> said de Cotret after meeting with native groups in Edmonton. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#X18:1> <quote> " What we want is a healthy herd, and there are other ways

to get that." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-027#19:1> Still, some wildlife experts contend that extermination is the

best way to prevent the contamination of other herds.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#20:1> The scientists say that tuberculosis and brucellosis are difficult to

detect, and can lie dormant for years.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#21:1> They also claim that rampant disease ( according to some estimates,

as many as 80 per cent of the bison are infected) has helped to reduce the

herd to fewer than 4,000 from more than 12,000 a few decades ago.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#22:1> Said Stacy Tessaro, a veterinary research scientist with Agriculture

Canada in Saskatoon: <quote> " It comes down to emotion versus scientific

assessments.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#23:1> Nobody wants to destroy an animal, but we have no vaccine and no way

to cure it." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-027#24:1> To bolster their arguments, agriculture experts point to a

similar epidemic of tuberculosis among water buffalo in northern Australia.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#25:1> Officials had 7,000 infected animals killed in about 146 square miles

of dense jungle between 1983 and 1985.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#26:1> <quote> " Complete depopulation was cheaper and a lot less painful to

the animals," </quote> said William Bulmer, the Ottawa-based director of

animal health for Agriculture Canada. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#X27:1> <quote> " Thorough management will solve the problem, whereas

inaction could mean the extinction of wood buffalo." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-027#28:1> For their part, defenders of the bison say that no one really

knows how many animals are infected by disease.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#29:1> Opponents of the proposed slaughter include some Alberta-based

employees at Parks Canada who, late last month, released an unofficial memo

that condemned the findings of the environmental assessment review panel.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#30:1> In their memo, the employees said that the allegations of widespread

disease may be unfounded because the most recent thorough study of the herd

took place in 1975.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#31:1> As well, the memo's authors claimed that the proposed slaughter put

the interests of cattle farmers above the integrity of Canada's national

parks.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#32:1> But agriculture experts say that the risk of contamination to cattle

could prove more costly in the long run.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#33:1> Officials declared Canada's 14 million cattle free of brucellosis in

1985 and expect them to be rid of tuberculosis by next year, creating greater

export opportunities in the United States and fewer inspection requirements.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#34:1> Federal officials say that Ottawa's &dollar;500-million fight to

eradicate both diseases in cattle may now be in jeopardy because of the Wood

Buffalo herd.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#35:1> Said John Kellar, Ottawa-based associate director of disease control

at Agriculture Canada: <quote> " We might risk our reputation for safe beef

exports.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#36:1> Slaughter seems drastic, but it's the only way to solve this."

</quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-027#37:1> Meanwhile, Agriculture Minister Donald Mazankowski supported de

Cotret in opposing the proposed mass slaughter.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#38:1> <}> <-> Mazankowksi </-> <+> Mazankowski </+> said that he plans to

seek cabinet support for a quarantine and partial slaughter of the animals

instead.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#39:1> That approach drew support from some naturalists and wildlife experts

who say that mass slaughter would be a destructive solution to an exaggerated

problem.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#40:1> Said Lindsay Wasylyshyn, vice-president of the Metis Association in

Fort Smith, N.W.T., just across the Alberta border from Wood Buffalo Park:

<quote> " Those buffalo are part of a food chain that extends from the wolves

on down to the bugs.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#41:1> Destroy them and you destroy the whole ecosystem." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#42:1> But, without a cure or vaccine on the horizon, many of the park's

bison may still be facing a death sentence. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#43:2> <h> A battle for control: Islanders take on the mighty Irving empire

</h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-027#44:2> During the 1860s, violent riots broke out on Prince Edward Island

as tenant farmers tried to gain ownership from absentee British landlords who

controlled the island's farmland.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#45:2> The farmers eventually succeeded.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#46:2> But now, Island farmers are up in arms again over what they claim is

an attempt by a single, powerful family to gain control over a large block of

P.E.I. farmland.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#47:2> The dispute places Premier Joseph Ghiz, who is also the province's

justice minister, in opposition to billionaire industrialist K. C. Irving and

one of his granddaughters.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#48:2> In April, Ghiz wrote to Mary Jean Irving, telling her and her

husband, Stewart Dockendorff, that he had reason to believe they had acquired

more land than the province permitted and ordered them to divest themselves

of some of it.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#49:2> If Irving is charged and found guilty of contravening the Lands

Protection Act, she could face a fine of &dollar;5,000 or up to six months in

jail. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-027#50:2> Ghiz is placing the resources of his tiny island against the

mighty Saint John, N.B.-based Irving industrial empire, with an estimated

&dollar;10 billion in assets in 1989.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#51:2> Irving interests now own or control nearly 25,000 acres of P.E.I.

cropland - about six per cent of the provincial total.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#52:2> Said Daniel Hendricken, who farms 125 acres of land near

Fanningbrook, 35 km east of Charlottetown: <quote> " Island farmers fought

hard to get control of their land.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#53:2> Now, we're losing it again." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-027#54:2> Since 1971, the Irving family plant at Cavendish Farms at New

Annan, 62 km southwest of Charlottetown, has processed potatoes grown on

3,000 acres of their land and another 17,000 acres leased or controlled by

them.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#55:2> In April, Conservative opposition leader Leone Bagnall declared that

Mary Jean Irving and her husband had purchased 4,800 additional acres of

farmland individually and on behalf of Indian River Farms Ltd., the

corporation they control.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#56:2> ( Under Island law at the time, corporations could own a maximum of

3,000 acres; individuals could own 1,000 acres each.)
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#57:2> Bagnall's revelation led 135 Island farmers to stage a protest march

in Charlottetown on April 23.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#58:2> Said James Rodd, a regional co-ordinator for the National Farmers

Union: <quote> " We don't want to go back to the time on P.E.I. when we were

tenants." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-027#59:2> Pressed to take action, Ghiz's Liberal government rushed a bill

through the legislature limiting future corporate acquisitions to five acres.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#60:2> For her part, Mary Jean Irving, who has until July 22 to reply to

Ghiz's letter, insists that there is no connection between her grandfather's

empire and the land she and her husband own.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#61:2> Meanwhile, the dispute may have contributed to a slowdown in Irving

investments.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#62:2> Some Islanders say that a planned expansion of Cavendish Farms was

put on hold after Ghiz's government began taking on the mighty Irving empire.

<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#63:3> <h> MYSTERY IN THE FIELDS: Experts study bizarre marks on the ground

</h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-027#64:3> Jennifer Skinner says that only aliens could have caused what

happened in her wheat field outside of Lethbridge, Alta.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#65:3> Skinner's son-in-law, Cyril Hubbard, was the first member of the

family to spot the strange occurrence: on Sept. 1, while harvesting in a

field, he noticed two 15-foot-wide circles connected by paths to a

20-foot-wide circle.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#66:3> <quote> " I don't like it," </quote> said Skinner after viewing the

site. <X> <
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#X67:3> quote> " There's no tracks, nothing.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#X68:3> This has been done from the air somehow.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#X69:3> It makes me nervous." </quote> </X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#70:3> Skinner's is one of at least six mysterious " crop circle sites" that

have appeared in southern Alberta fields since Aug. 21.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#71:3> Circles of flattened grain have been reported in hundreds of

locations across North America, Britain and Australia.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#72:3> Researchers are baffled by the phenomenon.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#73:3> Says Herman Austenson, a professor of crop sciences at the University

of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon who studied a site near North Battleford, Sask.:

<quote> " I can tell you one thing - it absolutely is not a hoax.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#74:3> But what caused it, I don't know." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-027#75:3> In Canada, the first crop circles were reported in Langenburg,

Sask., in 1974.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#76:3> In the past two years, about 20 more circles have been found in

Saskatchewan and Alberta, and more have been reported across the western

United States.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#77:3> The largest concentration of circles is in England.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#78:3> According to Ralph Noyes, secretary of the 800-member, year-old

Centre for Crop Circle Studies in London, scientists have documented more

than 1,000 so-called circle events in Britain.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#79:3> About half of those have occurred in a 20-square-mile corner of the

southern English county of Wiltshire.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#80:3> There, Britons have seen and photographed an assortment of patterns

of flattened grain. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-027#81:3> Theories about the causes of crop circles range from unconfirmed

assumptions about extraterrestrial spaceships allegedly hovering over

agricultural land to scientific explanations involving lightning, magnetic

fields and unusual wind patterns.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#82:3> Ieuan Evans, a supervisor in the Alberta government's plant-diseases

section in Edmonton, offers an agriculturally based theory: he says that a

lack of nutrients, such as copper, in the soil could cause grain to collapse

under its own weight.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#83:3> Still, the most widely accepted explanation comes from Terence

Meaden, director of the Circle Effects Research Group in Bradford-on-Avon,

near Bath, England.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#84:3> Meaden, who was once a physics professor at Dalhousie University in

Halifax, says that the circles are created by " ring vortices" - electrically

charged spinning balls of air that form when winds flow over hills.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#85:3> According to Meaden, the vortices sometimes touch down briefly in

fields, flattening the crops growing there in a circular pattern. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-027#86:3> Some other experts offer more fanciful explanations.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#87:3> Noyes, for one, said that whatever is behind the circles <quote> "

displays an almost limitless inventiveness, an ability to design and

redesign." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#88:3> He added: <quote> " What the hell it is, what degree of intelligence

it exhibits, I wouldn't know." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-027#89:3> But whatever their cause, the circles have a strong effect on

some of the people who see them.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#90:3> Last summer, Darrell Roth spotted circles in a neighbor's wheat field

near Christopher Lake, 50 km north of Prince Albert, Sask.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#91:3> Roth, the editor and publisher of the Lake-scapes Weekly, a tourist

newspaper, said that one circle was between 60 and 70 feet in diameter and

that the wheat inside it was completely flattened.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#92:3> Around it was a four- to five-foot-wide band of wheat that was still

standing and, beyond that, another two- to three-foot-wide circle in which

the wheat had collapsed.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#93:3> Roth said that about 300 yards away, there was a smaller set of

circles.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#94:3> <quote> " It makes you feel a little bit small," </quote> said Roth.

<X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#X95:3> <quote> " You can't help but think <quote> 'Who the heck are we?'

</quote> when you see something like what I saw." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-027#96:3> Even pranksters are considered a possible cause of the circles.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#97:3> Says Gordon Kijek, director of an Edmonton-based group that studies

reports of unidentified flying objects: <quote> " We could end up tomorrow

with a group stepping forward and saying, 'We did it, and here's how we did

it.' " </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#98:3> After the two crop circles were discovered near Lethbridge last week,

Kijek collected grain and soil samples from one site and sent them to a

provincial laboratory in Edmonton for testing.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#99:3> Still, he says that he suspects some form of intelligent being was

involved.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#100:3> <quote> " It's so precise and so neat and so unreal," </quote> Kijek

added. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#X101:3> <quote> " It doesn't look like a random act of nature." </quote>

</X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-027#102:3> But the search for the real answers about the mystery so far has

taken a circular route. </p>
