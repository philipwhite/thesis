<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#2:1> <bold> By GABOR MATE </bold> ... <it> Vancouver freelance writer.

</it>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#3:1> IN THE wake of the demise of the Eastern Europe dictator <l>

ships, socialists and progress <l> ives in the West have had to endure the

slings and arrows of outrageous critics. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#4:1> One recent contributor to this page, a would-be ornithologist,

professed to sight <quote> " genuine red-crested Marxist-Leninists chirp <l>

ing" </quote> at our universities.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#5:1> He then described as <quote> " chameleon-like" </quote> a local

political personality who, in 1981, had expressed sup <l> port both for

Poland's Solidar <l> ity trade union and for Nicara <l> gua's Sandin <l>

istas.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#6:1> The writer thought this was a contradiction. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#7:1> In reality, the same principle applied in both cases.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#8:1> In Poland a grassroots organization representing the will of the

people was challenging a tyrannical regime imposed by a foreign power.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#9:1> In Nicaragua, a revolu <l> tionary movement supported by the large

majority of the popula <l> tion had overthrown a murderous dictatorship

imposed upon them by a superpower, which continued to contrive to restore the

rule of its henchmen. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#10:1> The confused argument of this commentator exemplifies a line of

thought prevalent in the West.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#11:1> Abhorring the tyrannies of so-called socialist regimes, this view

condones the U.S.-backed dictator <l> ships of the so-called free world, no

matter how much blood sticks to their hands. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#12:1> The killing of thousands of Romanians evokes outrage; the

massacre of tens of thousands of Guatemalan peasants does not.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#13:1> The police murder of a Polish priest is condemned; the large-scale

killings of Central American priests and nuns bring embar <l> rassed silence.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#14:1> Sorrow and anger are the response to food lines and deprivation in

the Eastern bloc; the deaths by starvation and malnutri <l> tion every year

of hundreds of thousands in our own hemisphere escape notice. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#15:1> What permits this one-sidedness of perception, this imbalance of

indignation? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#16:1> Such myopia afflicts people at all points of the political

spectrum.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#17:1> It has been rightly pointed out that many on the left allowed them

<l> selves to be duped by the rhetoric of the Communist dictatorships, that

their critique of capitalism led them to accept the worst sort of

inhumanities committed in the name of socialism. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#18:1> Of this word <mention> " socialism" </mention> the new

Czechoslovak president Vaclav Havel has written that although it was at one

time <quote> " for whole genera <l> tions of the downtrodden and oppressed ...

a mesmerizing syn <l> onym for a just world," </quote> in Eastern Europe it

<quote> " was transformed long ago into just an ordinary truncheon used by

certain cynical, parvenu bureaucrats to bludgeon their lib <l> eral-minded

fellow citizens from morning until night." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#19:1> And worse.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#20:1> Leon Trotsky said in defence of the Bolshevik revolution that it had

destroyed <quote> " an aristocra <l> tic culture [ which had] introduced into

world parlance such barba <l> risms as <it> czar </it> , <it> pogrom </it> ,

and <it> knout </it> ." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#21:1> True, but 70 years later we must also understand how the infamous

term <it> gulag </it> came to enter the inter <l> national lexicon. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#22:1> Some critics of capitalism were misled by their need for faith

that not only is a different system other than one based on greed and nar <l>

row self-interest possible, but that it had already been realized some <l>

where.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#23:1> Evidence to the contrary was dismissed as hostile propa <l> ganda.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#24:1> As a student activist in the 1960s I belonged for a while to a

group that rejected the Soviet model of socialism as hopelessly degraded and

corrupt, but placed trust in Mao's China instead.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#25:1> The depreda <l> tions of the Cultural Revolution which was then

destroying the lives of countless human beings were, to us, but inventions of

the bourgeois press.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#26:1> We rationalized away doubts that we felt inwardly. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#27:1> Staunch defenders of the capi <l> talist system evince a similar

rigid <l> ity of thought.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#28:1> Their sense of security and privilege, therefore their peace of mind,

are threatened by any suggestion that the system they identify with is

neither just nor moral nor particularly efficient in meeting human needs.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#29:1> They are unmoved by the proximity of mil <l> lions of lives blighted

by economic injustice and poverty even in the North American capitalist heart

<l> land. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#30:1> Marcel Proust has described the compulsion to believe. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#X31:1> <quote> " The facts of life do not penetrate to the sphere in which

our beliefs are cherished; they did not engender those beliefs, and they are

powerless to destroy them; they can inflict on them continual blows of

contradic <l> tion and disproof without weak <l> ening them; and an avalanche

of miseries and maladies succeeding one another without interruption in the

bosom of a family will not make it lose faith in either the clemency of its

God or the capacity of its physician." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#32:1> People left, right, and centre develop mechanisms to dismiss

unpleasant facts from their con <l> sciousness.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#33:1> We deny them, we defame those who insist on bring <l> ing them to our

attention, we embrace some self-serving theory to explain them away.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#34:1> We permit political, ethnic, or religious loyal <l> ties to stifle

within us the voices of conscience that urge us towards a true and non-biased

view of events. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#35:1> At Tomas Masaryk, another intellectual who became president of

Czechoslovakia, once remarked: <quote> " It hurts to think." </quote> </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#36:2> <h> <bold> Church versus state, again </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#37:2> <bold> By ARTHUR SCHLESINGER </bold> ... <it> of the City University

of New York. </it>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#38:2> NEW YORK

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#39:2> AS A veteran of the 1960 campaign, I thank heaven that Bishop

Austin Vaughan and John Cardinal O'Connor were not sounding off when John F.

Kennedy was running for president. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#40:2> First, Bishop Vaughan, the vicar of Orange County and pas <l> tor

of St. Patrick's Church in Newburgh, N.Y., appeared to consign Gov. Mario

Cuomo to hell for not opposing abortion.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#41:2> Now the cardinal rushes to the bishop's defence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#42:2> Bishop Vaughan, Cardinal O'Connor says, is under <quote> " the

obligation to warn any Catholic that his soul is at risk if he should die

while deliberately pursuing any gravely evil course of action" </quote> -

such as advocating the right of women to choose whether to have an abortion.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#43:2> The fact that a majority of conscientious and God-fearing

Americans fails to regard the advocacy of freedom of choice as a gravely evil

course of action does not count with these prelates. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#44:2> BISHOP Vaughan and Cardi <l> nal O'Connor are pursuing a weird

course.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#45:2> They seem to be doing their best to verify the fears long cherished

by the Know-Nothings in the 1850s, the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s and a

succession of anti-Catho <l> lic demagogues that the Roman Catholic Church

would try to overrule the American demo <l> cratic process. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#46:2> They seem to be doing their best to prove the case that Catholic

politicians will not be free to act for what a majority regards as the

general good. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#47:2> Sixty-three years ago, bigots said that because Gov. Alfred E.

Smith of New York was a Roman Catholic his loyalty to the Pope in Rome would

super <l> sede his loyalty to the Constitu <l> tion and therefore he could

not be trusted in the White House. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#48:2> Al Smith replied: <quote> " I recognize no power in the

institutions of my church to interfere with the operations of the

Constitution of the United States or the enforcement of the law of the land.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#49:2> I believe in absolute free <l> dom of conscience ... in the absolute

separation of church and state ...
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#50:2> I believe that no tribunal of any church has any power to make any

decree of any force in the law of the land, other than to establish the sta

<l> tus of its own communicants within its own church." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#51:2> Fortunately, there were no Bishop Vaughans or Cardinal O'Connors

around to gainsay Al Smith and consign him to hell.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#52:2> Nevertheless, there were too many suspicions around for him to win

the election. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#53:2> Thirty years ago, the bigots said that because John F. Ken <l>

nedy was a Roman Catholic he too could not be trusted in the White House.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#54:2> Senator Kennedy replied, <quote> " I believe in an America where the

separation of church and state is absolute - where no Catholic prelate would

tell the president ( should he be Catholic) how to act ... where no public

official either requests or accepts instruction on public policy from the

Pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesias <l> tical

source - where no reli <l> gious body seeks to impose its will directly or

indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials."

</quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#55:2> FOR YEARS, the bigots have said the church would not hesi <l>

tate to impose its will upon the general populace or to tell Catholic

politicians how to act.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#56:2> Then Al Smith and John Ken <l> nedy said, and showed, that Catholics

in politics are as free as any other American citizens to base their

judgments on the national interest and the demo <l> cratic process. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#57:2> Now Bishop Vaughan and Cardinal O'Connor are in dan <l> ger of

vindicating those who have been saying that Catholics in politics must obey

the ukases of Rome. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#58:2> I thank heaven that Bishop Vaughan and Cardinal O'Con <l> nor

were not holding forth in 1960.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#59:2> If they had spoken then as they speak now, John F. Ken <l> nedy would

never have been elected president. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#61:3> NEW YORK

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#62:3> MIKHAIL GORBACHEV stood at the chasm and carefully took a his <l>

toric step back from destruc <l> tion. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#63:3> After four years of refusal, Gorbachev joined the tide against

the monopoly power of the Soviet Communist party. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#64:3> He decided that to keep swimming against it would soon drown him,

the party and the nation, so wretched is the rule of the party he leads and

so total its failure. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#65:3> But the chasm remains. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#66:3> Should Americans try to help build a bridge across it? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#67:3> The question has taken on a new political and moral impor <l>

tance after Gorbachev's pro <l> nouncements. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#68:3> To say it fast: The Soviet Union is as near collapse as a country

can be without explod <l> ing into total revolution. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#69:3> Economically, this huge conti <l> nental nation becomes hun <l>

grier, shabbier and colder week by week.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#70:3> It is barely Third World. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#71:3> POLITICALLY, the colonial empire that czars and commis <l> sars

called a single nation is moving rapidly toward its des <l> tiny -

fragmentation. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#72:3> That would be a blessing, if the national and ethnic hatreds and

bigotries accumulated under colonialism allowed it to happen without pogrom

and massacre. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#73:3> What's more, the coming col <l> lapse of the entire Soviet Com

<l> munist system leaves the people without any plan for a govern <l> ment of

the future. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#74:3> Gorbachev's hodgepodge, halfway-house perestroika is already

another synonym for failure. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#75:3> Yes, Americans can help build the bridge across chaos to tomorrow

but only in special American ways, quite other than soda and hamburgers. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#76:3> Here is one way: Broaden and take part in the kind of work

American human rights groups have been doing for a long, dif <l> ficult time.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#77:3> Day after dark day, these groups kept in touch with Soviet

freedom fighters and spread the word of the struggle.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#78:3> These American groups helped the dissidents create an essen <l> tial

for freedom: the interna <l> tional awareness of the Commu <l> nist tyranny

and the fact that the fight against it was going on behind the homeland

walls. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#79:3> WITH the goal of Soviet freedom coming closer, it would be a

tragedy if Americans now walked away from the Soviet citizens and movements

that have been fighting for years and concentrated exclusively on Soviet

officialdom. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#80:3> The longtime freedom fight <l> ers need attention and help - and

not simply for moral or emotional reasons, which are important enough. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#81:3> The struggle for Soviet free <l> dom is still in its early

stages. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#82:3> Many American groups are helping the Soviet democracy movement.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#83:3> In doing so they help all Soviet people.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#84:3> I list the following four as thanks for their help in keeping me

informed: </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#85:3> Helsinki Watch, 485 Fifth Avenue, New York 10017; Free <l> dom

House, 48 East 21st Street, New York 10010; International League for Human

Rights, 432 Park Avenue South, New York 10016, and the Centre for Democracy

in the U.S.S.R., 358 West 30th Street, New York 10001. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#86:3> Another bridge builder: </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#87:3> Hugely expanded contacts between American groups and the Soviet "

informals," the scores of thousands of Soviet clubs, unions and cultural

organizations that sprouted in the soil of hope. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#88:3> Some will blossom into local parties if democracy is allowed to

grow in the Soviet Union. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#89:3> From American unions, polit <l> ical and religious groups, uni

<l> versities and professional socie <l> ties, they need fax machines,

computers, copiers - and the fresh air of foreign contact. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#90:3> That was a crime under com <l> munism. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#91:3> The degree to which it is allowed now will have a lot to do with

speeding the inevitable end of the entire Communist system. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#92:3> That, of course, is the only guarantee that the promise of choice

becomes the reality of choice, which is the single bridge across the chasm.

</p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#93:4> <h> <bold> Dene infighting is destructive </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#94:4> People are confused about who the aboriginal people in Denendeh

are.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#95:4> We, ourselves, of all people should know who we are.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#96:4> In our own aboriginal language our people refer to us as Dene, which

inter <l> preted into English means <mention> " the people." </mention> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-005#97:4> Some of our people ( like half-breeds in the South) refer to

themselves as Metis.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-005#98:4> I believe this term Metis came from the French language, and means

<mention> " half-breed." </mention> </p> </I>
