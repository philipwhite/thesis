<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#163:1:B> <[> Yeah <,> yeah <,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#164:1:B> We looked at some </[> </{> not exactly where you are but

more like <{1> <[1> Westbourne </[1> Rosedale
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#165:1:B> And those streets
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#166:1:B> <{2> <[2> somehow didn't </[2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#167:1:A> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#168:1:A> <[2> But if you </[2> </{2> <unclear> word </unclear> too far

<}> <-> you <.> ca </.> <{1> <[1> it's <.> i </.> </[1> </-> <=> you feel

</=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#169:1:A> Like <}> <-> I don't feel like I don't feel uhm <,> </-> <=> I

don't feel uh </=> </}> <,,> <}> <-> sorta </-> <+> sort of </+> </}> cut off

because we're right on <.> s </.> on the main
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#170:1:A> <{2> <[2> road which has a bus or </[2> the uh <?> thing </?>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#171:1:B> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#172:1:B> <[2> Mm hmm <,> yeah </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#173:1:B> Yeah

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#174:1:A> You know it's easier not taking the car

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#175:1:B> Yeah
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#176:1:B> <{> <[> But <,> certainly if </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#177:1:A> <[> But <,> if </[> </{> you go a little deeper

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#178:1:B> Yeah

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#179:1:A> Like even if you go down to uhm <,,> you know on our street

<,> or our type of street <,> but <{> <[> closer to the </[> park

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#180:1:B> <[> Closer to the </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#181:1:B> Yeah

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#182:1:B> Like Fielding and Chester <?> kind of it's </?>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#183:1:A> It's <?> not good to </?> walk

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#184:1:B> No

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#185:1:A> It's kind of a depressed area <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> around

Fielding
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#186:1:A> <{2> <[2> and south </[2> city and that cos it's that <,> walk <?>

through </?> the uh
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#187:1:A> <{3> <[3> <unclear> word </unclear> </[3>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#188:1:B> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#189:1:B> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#190:1:B> <[3> Yeah </[3> </{3>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#191:1:B> The other thing that I wasn't crazy about <,> I mean I like your

street and <?> that </?> with the houses on them but <}> <-> the </-> <=> the

</=> </}> streets we looked at with apartments they were all sort of modern

<,> like sixties <{> <[> kind of </[> apartments

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#192:1:A> <[> Oh yeah </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#193:1:B> <{> <[> <,> <?> Really ugly </?> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#194:1:B> <[> And <,> <}> <-> they </[> </{> they </-> <=> they </=>

</}> had more of a feel of like apartment buildings even though they were

only duplexes <{> <[> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#195:1:B> Because </[> they had this sort of <,> like uhm <,> you know <,>

that kind of flooring tile up the stairs and

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#196:1:A> <[> Yeah <?> right </?> </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#197:1:B> You know what I mean
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#198:1:B> Like <}> <-> it was just <{> <[> <,> </-> <=> it </[> was more

</=> </}> apartmenty feeling

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#199:1:A> <[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#200:1:B> <{> <[> So </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#201:1:A> <[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#202:1:B> But the only thing is this place I mean the woman is <,>

ninety-nine percent sure she's moving to Colorado but <,> if she flakes out

on us at the last minute we're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> be

<{> <[> <,,> </[> uh upset yes

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#203:1:A> <[> Upset </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#204:1:A> But remember she had to give notice <{> <[> so she </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#205:1:B> <[> <}> <-> She </-> </[> </{> <=> well she </=> </}> has <}>

<-> a ninety day </-> <=> a ninety day </=> </}> clause in her lease
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#206:1:B> And <}> <-> she's </-> <=> she's </=> </}> almost positive she's

going
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#207:1:B> But <}> <-> it's just </-> <=> <,> she tends </=> </}> to like to

keep her options open a little bit <{> <[> and </[> I <}> <-> kinda </-> <+>

kind of </+> </}> know her <,> my mother <}> <-> sorta </-> <+> sort of </+>

</}> knows her

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#208:1:A> <[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#209:1:B> But <,> we're pretty sure it's <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going

to </+> </}> work out
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#210:1:B> Just the way it happened was sort of so <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> <.> n

</.>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#211:1:B> <{2> <[2> destined <,> you know </[2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#212:1:A> <[1> Perfect </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#213:1:A> <[2> Like the best way it happens </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#214:1:B> Yeah
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#215:1:B> And it was perfect for us too the place
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#216:1:B> It's great

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#217:1:A> Well it's funny how sometimes uh <,> that <}> <-> kinda </->

<+> kind of </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#218:1:A> I've always <?> been </?> optimistic <{> <[> <,> especially <?>

the type <}> <-> a </-> <+> of </+> </}> </?> </[> <,> you know things that

happen

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#219:1:B> <[> Yeah <,> I am too </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#220:1:B> <{> <[> Yeah </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#221:1:A> <[> And </[> </{> uh usually just when you're at your <,>

limit or <{1> <[1> <,> when </[1> you think things are <}> <-> gonna </-> <+>

going to </+> </}> happen
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#222:1:A> <{2> <[2> something always happens </[2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#223:1:B> <[1> Mm hmm </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#224:1:B> <[2> <}> <-> We we always </-> <=> we almost </=> </}> rented

</[2> </{2> this one that was seven ninety
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#225:1:B> It was a beautiful place but it was very uhm
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#226:1:B> It was expensive for us <,> to pay that <{> <[> much
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#227:1:B> It was </[> heated but still

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#228:1:A> <[> Heated </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#229:1:B> That's still a lot
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#230:1:B> <{1> <[1> To </[1> jump from five hundred to seven ninety is quite

a
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#231:1:B> <{2> <[2> uh <,> </[2> a jump

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#232:1:A> <[1> Yeah </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#233:1:A> <[2> Yeah </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#234:1:B> And it was also an apartment that was sort of almost too

fancy for us in a way
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#235:1:B> Like it was a bit of a kind of <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#236:1:B> Like the people in there now are professors you know
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#237:1:B> And <,> <}> <-> sorta </-> <+> sort of </+> </}> like <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#238:1:B> I <}> <-> dunno </-> <+> don't know </+> </}> it just didn't feel

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#239:1:A> You're a professor too

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#240:1:B> Yeah
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#241:1:B> I know <{> <[> I'm a professor </[> <unclear> word </unclear> but

not that kind of professor you know

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#242:1:A> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#243:1:A> <}> <-> Where </-> <=> where </=> </}> exactly was it

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#244:1:B> It was on Regent just below Sherbrooke
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#245:1:B> That's one <,> west of Melrose

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#246:1:A> And what was the other like

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#247:1:B> Nice
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#248:1:B> The streets are nice
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#249:1:B> Because <}> <-> they <{> <[> just </-> <=> it's just </=> </}> one

block </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#250:1:A> <[> I might uh </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#251:1:A> I might tell <@> Jan and Alexis </@> about that
<ICE-CAN:S1A-007#252:1:A> Cos I know that they're prepared to pay

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-007#253:1:A> I'm <}> <-> tryna </-> <+> trying to </+> </}> get them to
