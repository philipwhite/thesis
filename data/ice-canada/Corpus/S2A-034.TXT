<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#1:1:A> She's talking about how <,> <}> <-> her </-> <=> this </=> </}>

society that she's found is completely unbalanced <,> how it's in a state of

chaos <,,> and how there's turmoil and the best way to convey that is <,> by

making your images look funny as well <,> as the text which tells you the

story
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#2:1:A> But more effective is what you see through the eye and how it makes

you feel
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#3:1:A> <}> <-> Do </-> <=> uh does </=> </}> anybody agree or not agree or

<}> <-> do do </-> <=> do </=> </}> you see the point <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#4:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#5:1:A> What about Cyndi Andrew's work <,,> the Thai work <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#6:1:A> Now remember she's a photojournalist <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#7:1:A> So <}> <-> did </-> <=> <,> did </=> </}> you see any difference <}>

<-> in </-> <=> in </=> </}> how she uh puts her images together <}> <-> as

</-> <=> as </=> </}> opposed to uhm let's say Fahmida Bhabha's <,> <}> <->

cos they're <.> p </.> </-> <=> cos they're </=> </}> quite different <X>

<$ZD> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X8:1:Z> <O> answer </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X9:1:A> That's true <,,> </X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#10:1:A> If you were a journalist <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> you

were supposed to go out and take a shot of a <,> crisis situation what would

you want to get
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#11:1:A> <}> <-> What kind of have what would you want </-> <=> What would

be </=> </}> the most important uhm <,> aspect of the photograph you were

going to take <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#12:1:A> Thinking that you have to <,,> go through a roll of film and get it

on an airplane or get it shipped out by satellite as fast as possible so it

can go into the newspaper <,> by the next morning or even by the end of that

day <X>

<$ZE> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X13:1:Z> <O> answer </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X14:1:A> Action and movement okay </X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#15:1:A> And <}> <-> what does that </-> <=> what is action and movement

</=> </}> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#16:1:A> Information <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#17:1:A> You want to get as much information as possible <,> <}> <-> into

the <.> fr </.> </-> <=> into the frame </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#18:1:A> You want to be able to tell
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#19:1:A> You're there <}> <-> at </-> <=> at </=> </}> a huge disaster
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#20:1:A> It's an earthquake let's say <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#21:1:A> And you've only got maybe <,,> a
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#22:1:A> Well you've got a load of film
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#23:1:A> Like you've got a tonne of film
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#24:1:A> Film is not an issue
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#25:1:A> But you know that <}> <-> your </-> <=> your </=> </}> art editor

<,> back in Canada can only use one picture and it's <}> <-> gotta </-> <+>

got to </+> </}> be the picture that has the most information that's telling

<,> the most <,> you possibly can about the degree of destruction <,> the

number of casualties the total horror of it all uhm maybe some kind of heroic

rescue thing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#26:1:A> There's some level of humanity and compassion all rolled into that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#27:1:A> So you've got a whole lot of material that you've <}> <-> gotta

</-> <+> got to </+> </}> try to get into one shot
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#28:1:A> And I think if you look at the way she sets up her large image <,,>

it's kind of an <.> i </.>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#29:1:A> <}> <-> And the <unclear> word </unclear> </-> <=> And the image

</=> </}> next to it <,,> the smaller one of the woman <}> <-> in the </->

<=> in the </=> </}> shanty it kind of gives you the idea of how you go about

<,> putting together that much information <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#30:1:A> How do you see how she constructs <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=>

</}> large image <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#31:1:A> <?> Do you have </?> any idea <X>

<$ZF> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X32:1:Z> <O> answer </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X33:1:A> Ya

<$ZF> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X34:1:Z> <O> answer continues </O> </X>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#35:1:A> So what we've got is she <}> <=> 's <,,> </=> <-> has </->

</}> this image <,> here this person <,> then there is this person and this

person and right at the back there are people
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#36:1:A> So she really sets up for your eye
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#37:1:A> Your eye is always going <,> everywhere
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#38:1:A> It's seeing everything that's going on in here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#39:1:A> Because she kinds of gives you a
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#40:1:A> You go from this side of the frame to that side and back and forth
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#41:1:A> So you're really getting as much out of the frame as possible <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#42:1:A> Also shot like this where she's trying to get as much information

as possible
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#43:1:A> The work that <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> policemen are

doing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#44:1:A> The uh street vendors that they are uh <,,> involved with <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#45:1:A> Because what they're doing essentially is making sure that the

carts <}> <-> don't </-> <=> <,> aren't </=> </}> too much in the sidewalk

and it's this whole issue of <}> <-> <.> wh </.> <.> wh </.> </-> <=> where

</=> </}> the road and the sidewalk and the market-area
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#46:1:A> And then plus the whole idea of just the traffic and the people and

the congestion and everyone that's going into this uh Bangkok market-area
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#47:1:A> So it's <,> getting a whole lot
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#48:1:A> Cos we see these photographs here <,,> are quite different again
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#49:1:A> <}> <-> What </-> <=> uhm <,,> what </=> </}> do you see about

Fahmida Bhabha's <,,> photographs
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#50:1:A> I mean she's not packing as much information
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#51:1:A> Cos it is a different
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#52:1:A> It's a different landscape too <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#53:1:A> But if you think about the Gaza Strip what's going on there <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#54:1:A> Right now
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#55:1:A> Gaza
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#56:1:A> Is it somewhere you want to go for a holiday <,,> <&> Supposed

audience response: not on recording </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#57:1:A> Why not <X>

<$ZG> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X58:1:Z> <O> answer </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X59:1:A> Right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X60:1:A> Palestinians </X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#61:1:A> It where uh one of the largest <}> <-> <.> Pales </.> </-> <=> uh

Palestinian </=> </}> refugee camps is
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#62:1:A> Uhm actually what this image talks about is how <,> all of this

area here is part of a Palestinian refugee camp that's been bulldozed <,> to

make room for Jewish settlements <,> which are back here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#63:1:A> And this is a Palestinian woman who's just <,,> had her <,>

community destroyed to make room for <,> the encroaching settlements <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#64:1:A> But <}> <-> what I'm </-> <=> what was </=> </}> great was you said

the word tension
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#65:1:A> Do you find that there is an element of tension here in these

images <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#66:1:A> What kind of <,,> <X>

<$ZH> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X67:1:Z> <O> answer </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X68:1:A> Uh huh

<$ZH> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X69:1:Z> <O> answer continues </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X70:1:A> Mhh hmm mhh hmm </X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#71:1:A> <}> <-> It </-> <=> There's </=> </}> something combative about her

photographs <,,> I find
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#72:1:A> Uhm everyone in these images seems very tense <,> and very uhm sort

of in your face
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#73:1:A> There's this kind of tension between people <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#74:1:A> Uh even in the scene <}> <-> of </-> <=> of </=> </}> a wedding

party
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#75:1:A> <}> <-> It's </-> <=> there's </=> </}> something frenetic about
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#76:1:A> There's something very tight and a little claustrophobic about it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#77:1:A> <}> <-> Like there's </-> <=> like it </=> </}> could explode into

something different <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#78:1:A> It's not <,> really uhm a relaxed fun kind of time
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#79:1:A> There's something very tight
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#80:1:A> Everybody's very tight <,> like every one's a little too tightly

wound <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#81:1:A> Does anybody have anything that they want to mention about anything

they have seen <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#82:1:A> Essentially <}> <-> what I wanted to </-> <=> what I want to point

out </=> </}> and what I'm hoping you're going to come away with <,> with

this uhm sort of talk is <}> <-> how </-> <=> <,> how </=> </}> to use images

to convey meanings
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#83:1:A> Uhm how do you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#84:1:A> And this is something that you can use if you're doing art

photography <,> uhm <,> as well as this style of uhm documenting and

storytelling photography
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#85:1:A> And <}> <-> to </-> <=> <,,> to </=> </}> go in and look also uhm

at work that people have done before you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#86:1:A> Uh <}> <-> <}> <-> <.> photog </.> </-> <+> photography </+> </}>

</-> <=> the history of photography </=> </}> and art history itself is

really important <,> because you can use it to your advantage <,> and <}> <->

makes </-> <=> make </=> </}> your own work <,> uhm speak to things that

someone else may have touched on but then you take it one step further
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#87:1:A> So <}> <-> it can </-> <=> it's always </=> </}> kind of

interesting because essentially art comes from art <,> photography comes from

photography
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#88:1:A> It's the same thing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#89:1:A> But it's interesting to see how you can twist it and make it your

own <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#90:1:A> Uhm <,> if there's no other questions <,,> that's it for me <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#91:1:A> Uhm thanks a lot for coming out <X>

<$ZH> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X92:1:Z> <O> Get's A's attention </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X93:1:A> Sure

<$ZH> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X94:1:Z> <O> question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X95:1:A> Mhh hmm

<$ZH> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X96:1:Z> <O> question continues </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X97:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X98:1:A> I realize

<$ZH> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#X99:1:Z> <O> question continues </O> </X>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#100:1:A> Okay uhm <}> <-> I'll talk </-> <=> I'll use Cyndi Andrew

</=> </}> as uhm <,,> an example <,> cos I workshopped with her so I talked

to her a lot about <,> how she went about doing her work <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#101:1:A> Uhm categorically she never
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#102:1:A> If she's driving along a road <,,> then she always carries
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#103:1:A> <}> <-> If </-> <=> if </=> </}> she's on a shoot she has three

cameras
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#104:1:A> If she's just going somewhere <,> uh like out for dinner with her

husband she's always got a little instamatic
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#105:1:A> She's always got a camera on herself <,> somewhere uh cos if

something happens she doesn't want to miss it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#106:1:A> Uhm <,,> but <,> in one instance she was driving along
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#107:1:A> Actually uhm not this particular photograph but it came at the

same time that she did this particular photograph
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#108:1:A> She was driving along they were on the road somewhere and she saw

uh <}> <-> some </-> <=> ah some </=> </}> kids playing <,> by the side of

the road and so they pulled over <,> and she got out and she had her camera

and <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#109:1:A> It's important to be able to speak some of the language of

wherever it is you are
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#110:1:A> That's really important
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#111:1:A> Now <,> <}> <-> they always </-> <=> these women always </=> </}>

went with interpreters
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#112:1:A> <}> <-> And </-> <=> uh and </=> </}> if you're in this

professionally you've always got an interpreter <,> but <}> <-> you </-> <=>

you've </=> </}> got to know some of the language anyway
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#113:1:A> So she always <,> comes up she introduces herself uh she asks them

like what are you doing do you live near here are your family around dah dah

dah dah dah
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#114:1:A> Then she says I'm from Canada <,> and I'm a photographer and would

it be alright for me to take your picture
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#115:1:A> Some people will go ya <,> great <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#116:1:A> Other people will go no
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#117:1:A> And if someone says no <,> you just don't take their picture <,>

ever
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#118:1:A> Uhm <,,> she said that you end up <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#119:1:A> As a woman you can sometimes get away with taking some shots <,>

that you might not be allowed to take
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#120:1:A> As a man you can get really hurt
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#121:1:A> Uhm <,,> you had to be careful
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#122:1:A> Ah in one instance she took a photograph in India of a cremation

uhm <,> but only because she had been a woman was she allowed to get the shot
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#123:1:A> If she'd been a man they <&> Tape ends </&> </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-034#124:2:A> One thing that is a constant <,,> whatever solution we decide

on <,,> we all have to live together in Montreal
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#125:2:A> French English ethics we have to live together
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#126:2:A> There is no choice in that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#127:2:A> Whatever solution you adopt <,> has to come to that choice <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#128:2:A> Now <,,> we've been faced so far <,> with two solutions <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#129:2:A> One of them is <,,> what I call by shorthand the Joe Clark

solution
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#130:2:A> That is <,,> give the separatists whatever they want <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#131:2:A> Make them happy <,,> and that way they'll stop <,,> <O> Audience

responds </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#132:2:A> Now <}> <-> ya </-> <+> you </+> </}> <}> <-> gotta </-> <+> have

got to </+> </}> admire Joe because here's something that hasn't worked for

twenty-five years <,,> and he still has faith
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#133:2:A> You <}> <-> gotta </-> <+> have got to </+> </}> admire him <,,>

but I don't have the slightest desire to follow him <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#134:2:A> The other choice we've been faced with <,,> is <,,> the choice

offered by the separatists
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#135:2:A> That is to split Canada off <,,> or split Quebec off from the rest

of Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#136:2:A> The trouble with that solution is <,> that we are not all going to

live together here very happily <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#137:2:A> In fact <,,> if the referendum had been won by fifty-one percent

and if Quebec had separated <,> could you imagine what life would have been

like <,,> in a place <,,> in which forty-nine percent of the people didn't

want to be there <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#138:2:A> And precisely the same problem <,> applies to partition <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#139:2:A> If you partition Quebec if you say okay <,,> we feel differently

we'll cut off this part of Quebec <,,> what's wrong with that is you've

recreated exactly the same problem the separatists have created <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#140:2:A> You've got a situation in which <,> almost half the people of

Montreal <,> wouldn't want to be here <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#141:2:A> So that doesn't work <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#142:2:A> I think there's another route to go <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#143:2:A> There's a
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#144:2:A> Ah you know <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> I want to caution

you too as I say this do not assume <,> that federation by itself would be a

solution
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#145:2:A> That somehow <,> if we could settle it all and stay united that

would cure everything <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#146:2:A> It wouldn't
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#147:2:A> We've been a part of federation for the last thirty years
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#148:2:A> It doesn't strike me that we have been a very happy people as a

result either French nor English
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#149:2:A> So we have to look at the problem a different way <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#150:2:A> And the way I want you to look at it is this <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#151:2:A> I want you <}> <-> to </-> <=> <,,> to </=> </}> think back to the

Bible <,> the story of Cain <,,> and Abel <,,> the children of Adam and Eve

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#152:2:A> Cain was a hunter <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#153:2:A> He had weapons <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#154:2:A> And Abel <,> was a farmer <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#155:2:A> He grew crops and raised animals <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#156:2:A> And Cain <,> killed Abel <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#157:2:A> There's a lesson in that <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#158:2:A> In the early days <,,> our ancestors ran wild and presumably naked

through the woods <,,> hunting <,,> and carried weapons <,,> but some of them

learned how to grow crops <,> and raise animals
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#159:2:A> And once they learned how to grow crops and raise animals they <,>

had to settle in one place <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#160:2:A> That one place becomes the village <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#161:2:A> And the people in the village lived together in large groups first

because they look after their crops and animals secondly because they have to

cooperate with each other <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#162:2:A> But while they're living together like that in cooperation <,>

they don't like strangers
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#163:2:A> And the reason they don't like them is because the wilderness is

so full of our other ancestors
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#164:2:A> Not my family
<ICE-CAN:S2A-034#165:2:A> But still full of our other ancestors who are wild <,> and hunted

and had weapons and who were dangerous <,,> and who would try and break in

and steal their animals and their crops <,,> </I>
