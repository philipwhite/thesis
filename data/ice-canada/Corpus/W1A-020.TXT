  A woman, as I see it, is more like moss or lichen ... as  she takes to her husband.    , this phrase  spoken by Ellen near the end of the novel is something I believe she picked  up from her friend when she first escaped the bush.  The essence of the phrase is that women cling to men as a source of  their identity.    herself as either Mrs Roxborough or Ellen Gluyas: this distinction in  Ellen's mind illustrates that it is society that makes a woman defined  through her husband as can be well illustrated in Ellen's loyal clinging to  her marriage through the carrying of her wedding ring.   life is significant as Ellen is    on nature for survival and her fringe of leaves to keep her 'decent'.      Lamming's short story " A Wedding in Spring" has a great deal to  say about cultural differences.  This passage is right at the beginning of the story, creating an  immediate contrast between these " foreigners" to London.  A theme of several of the stories this term is learning about the 'colonizer'  country.  Flo, Beresford, Knickerbock and Snooker experience London at  Beresford's wedding to a white girl at different levels.  Flo is torn between her love for her brother and a loyalty to her  culture.  She resents that Beresford is marrying a white woman and attempts to   the wedding.   londoners  a great wedding.  This difference in perception of the city of London creates cultural  conflict between one who would be assimilated and accepted ( Beresford) and  his sister who wished to maintain her cultural identity.     This early bi-play between Jangamuttuk and Fada defines their  relationship in terms of appearances and of control.  Fada is shown to be the one who thinks he has control but the natives  are the ones who control him.  Both Jangamuttuk and Ludgee are able to manipulate the 'ghosts' as is  illustrated in a kind of seeming  acquiescence   'About to boss' Jangamuttuk said humouring him   .  is something of free and direct  discourse (  ) hints that it is the master  manipulator Jangamuttuk that will triumph in the end.  They certainly trick Sonny in the end and escape through a sort of  passive resistance that undermines the 'ghosts'.     This passage between Naigar and Bridget is an example of the  tension between the two doctors and their different methods.  Naigar is resentful of Bridget and many times attempts to humble her.  This passage contains also different grammar to show a language  difference  Naigar  points out that it is  that the novel deals with  rather than the rich.  Characters such as Parvati and Asha are examples of women that the  doctors interact with and this passage empowers  as  knowledgeable and able to be successful.     The Lawson " Drover's Wife" treats the wife as out of her element  in a number of incidents.  Lawson only enables her to a certain degree then diffuses her power.  The men in this story ( and particularly this passage: Tommy) are  depicted as heroic.  The Drover's wife fights the blaze as best  she can but it is the bush men who save her.  She seems strong sometimes but Lawson always ends up making her cry  or break down as in the example of the dam breaking.  Certainly the snake is killed but it is her fault that he is there  and the dog helps.  his mother as  somewhat helpless in the end and says he'll always stay: basically to protect  her.     The language used in this passage is a key to the inability of  Anancy to understand the  .  There is a cultural reference to lashes and punishment.  This comments on the aggressive nature of the Land of Billboards.  the   and in many ways one  can interpret this as weakness but perhaps what Salkey is getting at is the  perceptions in his story is of one who cannot understand his surroundings and  is doing his utmost to cope: even becoming white.    Ellen Roxborough and Mala can be compared as two distinct and  different characters through the traits of Passion, Power and Fertility.  A comparison between  Ellen and Austin and Mala and her father enhances these three traits as  differences between the genders.    Passion is a quality that both Ellen and Mala have, Ellen  suppresses her passion so aggressively for the first half of the novel, only  hints of it indicate it is there.   rigid  invalid, she is unable to express her passion in the face of  disgrace before her husband.  Ellen escapes the passionless surroundings by racing through the  forest on horseback.  Her passion is most obvious when White refers to her as Ellen Gluyas.  This former self greatly contrasts the Mrs. Roxborough self who is   on her husband and must out of  duty protect him from a judging society.   the man I call father  .    .  Mala's father resists Canadian society and is very concerned with the  Indian community.  The contrast of these two individuals, Father and daughter show how  two very strong characters become alienated from one another due to genders (  he was not so concerned about his sons) and power issues  Where Mala's passion led her to empowerment and success, Ellen's led  her through many mental trials.    through her rescue by Jack.  More important to the actual passionate acts is the circumstances  which led to them.  Ellen, without her husband, reduced to a slave was subject to almost  an animal state, scavenging and once being   cannibalistic  ( *not  necessarily the view of this writer)   This state as White portrays it is of the savage animal-like natives  who capture Ellen.  The men and women of these tribes are definitely different: Men are  warriors, women domestic.    Where Ellen is reduced to savagery through the loss of social  power of her community, Mala gains  independence   from her escape from her father's home.  Mala's father is often portrayed as an unforgiving, evil character  who deserves to be reduced to a coma state and death in the end.  Mara, portrays  the father as a demon,  exacting punishment, unfair  rules and even being a lecherous man in bed with his wife, Parvati.  Because Mala escapes into the world ( with her mother's money) she is  able to establish herself and have a family.    Mala is portrayed as being fertile, like her mother, able to have  healthy children.  Ellen is portrayed as being infertile and therefore inferior.  The longing Ellen has for children is never fulfilled.  Ellen wants to please Austin by bearing him children, it is true, but  more importantly she wants someone to love unconditionally.  Many times, Ellen attempts to find this love through young Oswald,  through Jack and through the Lovell children but she is never truly  satisfied.  Jack is the closest she comes to finding a passionate relationship  but it falls short in terms of societal acceptability.  demote  her in her own mind and reduce her further in society.  Because women are domestic in both the societies Ellen lives in the  death of her diseased  is yet another instance of her failure.  Ellen's relationship with Mr R. is a nurturing one, Ellen enduring a  great deal ( passionless sex for one) for the sake of duty.  Because she is unable to perform the duty of having children she  feels  .  in her  child is evident because of her happiness with her husband and ability to  mutually experience the joy of a family.  Parvati can be very strongly contrasted with Mohan to exhibit great  gender differences, Mala and her white husband have more of an equal  relationship.  for   for her husband, rather a beautiful part of a loving relationship.  Children for Mohan and Parvati was a duty rather than an act of love.  It was this duty that Dr. Bridget was able to play upon to help  Parvati escape her strong father in-law.      Power, Passion and fertility are elements which illuminate the  major characters in    .  Ellen and Mala are two very different characters from different times  but both are subjected to many of the same social stigmas.     This poem seems very concerned with nature.  The poem itself is almost a painting of a scene in nature.  creeps across the sky     .  She tussles,  she tugs at the earth.   This fighting with nature seems to represent a struggle.  The woman wishes to paint the scene but has to manipulate her  surroundings in order to do so.  The further contrast to the woman and her surroundings is that she is  inside the sunhat rather than simply wearing it.  This oppression of clothing may signify the hat blocking her  perspective or perhaps even clothing as an element of western culture imposes  on her metaphorically showing her struggle with her surroundings rather than  a compliance to it.  The fact that this poem is a " close up" and does not reveal a great  deal may comment  though         Linda is upset because she does not have another choice in life,  meaning that her vocation as a wife is set.    are maid  servants who, contrary to Beryl, have more freedom because of their class.  Alice enjoys her freedom when she is in the kitchen.  white gloves   higher   than she really is.  Beryl, a social snob, is resentful of Alice's freedom to choose a  suitor of her pleasing.  Alice, however, as the domestic help wishes that she had more of a  social life and is therefore very flattered with Mrs. Stubbs invitation to  tea.    Asha enjoys her freedom and independence of relying of herself  for support as well as deciding not to have children.  Her world is that of domestic tasks, however she uses her talent of  embroidery to augment  and improve her standard of living to  a respectable level.  Asha, unlike her sister, resists the chains of marriage and  motherhood to find her own individual and comfortable place in society, not  subservient to men.    and " At the Bay", women are  shown differently from men as having a limited amount of choice in vocation.  Parvati, due to her unexpected pregnancy, needed to choose the life  of marriage, children and duty towards these responsibilities.  Parvati complies with her responsibilities and accepts her station in  life.   tion and therefore does not comply  easily with her  duties as a wife to Stanley.  Beryl, although a social snob, feels trapped in a hierarchy of  class, unable to choose the suitor she pleases.  but whose   .  Both these women's classes free them of many social responsibilities  ( such as marrying money) and allow them the freedom to choose marriage and a  family, though it is not expected.  In the two works, we see contrasts of women in different situations,  coming from different perspectives who struggle, sometimes   with  women  who are  to men and  therefore, their lives are limited.    by Stow shows the change in  the village which has taken place after the  of   takes place.  A shift in hierarchy and power where MacDonnell learns to survive in  the village as King, as Benoni is chieftain.  They reach a higher understanding of the class of culture which has  brought violence and destruction to the villages and the effects of the  colonial power on the life of the native people.
