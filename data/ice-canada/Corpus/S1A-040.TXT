<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#181:1:B> Oh no
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#182:1:B> A little bit at night
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#183:1:B> But no in the daytime it was just excruciating
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#184:1:B> We were planning on going <}> <-> to </-> <=> down to </=> </}>

the beach and uhm <,> <}> <-> the it </-> <=> we </=> </}> couldn't go

because there was too much <,> bacteria in the <{> <[> water </[>

<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#192:1:B> <}> <-> It it </-> <=> I don't know if it </=> </}> was that kind

of pollution when I was kid but when I was a teenager you wouldn't go in Lake

Erie
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#193:1:B> But you know after that it was fine
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#194:1:B> You know they made all kinds of laws <,> about companies and <{>

<[> <,> municipalities </[> putting sewage and you know crap chemicals in

there and

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#195:1:A> <[> <?> Put in </?> there </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#196:1:A> Mhh hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#197:1:B> <}> <-> And uh </-> <=> and it's </=> </}> been pretty clean

ever since
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#198:1:B> But it's just been really hot

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#199:1:A> So you'd say it's getting better now <}> <-> the Great </->

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#200:1:B> <[> Ya I don't know </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#201:1:B> <}> <-> I I <,,> </-> <=> when I </=> </}> asked about it they
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#202:1:B> <}> <-> I we </-> <=> I </=> </}> had a bit of an argument with

one of the girls from Vancouver
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#203:1:B> She was saying how wonderful Vancouver is and how horrible St

Thomas is and I said <,> well to tell you the truth I didn't even like it

there <,,> because I get up in the morning
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#204:1:B> Cos it was kind of a trip to see mountains
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#205:1:B> I'd never seen mountains before
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#206:1:B> And I get up in the morning and rush out to see the mountains and

every morning there'd be this brownish yellow <,> haze along there cos <{>

<[> <,> </[> it's quite industrial

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#207:1:A> <[> Mhh </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#208:1:B> The wind <}> <-> blows the </-> <=> from the sea blows </=>

</}> the <,> pollution and <}> <-> it </-> <=> the </=> </}> mountains are

there and it just stops <{> <[> and </[> hangs around there

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#209:1:A> <[> Mhh hmm </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#210:1:A> Mhh hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#211:1:B> And it's <,> a big city
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#212:1:B> It smells bad
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#213:1:B> And <,> you can see the pollution
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#214:1:B> And I said <?> look </?> it's polluted there
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#215:1:B> <{> <[> You've got smog </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#216:1:A> <[> So this was at the </[> </{> wedding

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#217:1:B> No it was <}> <-> the next </-> <=> yesterday </=> </}>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#218:1:A> Ohh <O> laugh </O>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#219:1:B> And well she was just being a grouch anyway
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#220:1:B> But you know just to defend St. Thomas I said at least there's

fresh air here

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#221:1:A> Mhh hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#222:1:B> We don't have smog
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#223:1:B> And she said oh <}> <-> you </-> <=> you </=> </}> think there's

no pollution in Toronto
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#224:1:B> And <}> <-> I </-> <=> I'm </=> </}> not talking about Toronto
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#225:1:B> It's polluted in Montreal too
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#226:1:B> It's polluted in Toronto and it's polluted in Vancouver
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#227:1:B> I'm talking about the difference between a small place and a big

place

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#228:1:A> Mhh hmm
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#229:1:A> <{> <[> Ya </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#230:1:B> <[> And </[> </{> the fact that they've got those mountains

there <,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#231:1:A> So she likes it where she lives

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#232:1:B> Ya mainly because it's far away from the parents <O> laugh

</O>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#233:1:B> You know her parents and her parents-in-law <}> <-> are ah </->

<=> are </=> </}> both in St. Thomas and

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#234:1:A> But they're all quite old and feeble

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#235:1:B> Ya <,> ya

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#236:1:A> I wonder why she likes being <,,> away

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#237:1:B> Ya I don't know

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#238:1:A> She's probably <}> <-> <.> g </.> </-> <+> got </+> </}> her

life centered <{> <[> <,,> </[> there now

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#239:1:B> <[> Ya </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#240:1:B> But anyway <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#241:1:B> I don't know like it is <}> <-> kinda </-> <+> kind of </+> </}>

disheartening
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#242:1:B> We were both saying that
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#243:1:B> To go back there <,> because <}> <-> it's uhm </-> <=> it's </=>

</}> <}> <-> sorta </-> <+> sort of </+> </}> depressed there
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#244:1:B> You know the whole economy of the place depended on the automotive

industry
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#245:1:B> <}> <-> And then </-> <=> <,> you know and the last recession </=>

</}> <,> all the factories just closed right down
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#246:1:B> Everybody's unemployed
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#247:1:B> It's got a really high unemployment rate there

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#248:1:A> Mhh hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#249:1:B> And there's nothing really <,> to take over
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#250:1:B> It's building back a little bit but it's not like a touristy place
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#251:1:B> <}> <-> It's not </-> <=> it doesn't </=> </}> have any

geographical <,,> drawing card
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#252:1:B> There's no mountains
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#253:1:B> <}> <-> There's no </-> <=> there's a </=> </}> lake but it's a

few miles away

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#254:1:A> Mhh hmm <,,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#255:1:B> <}> <-> Used to it was </-> <=> <,> it's there </=> </}>

because of the railroads
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#256:1:B> It's halfway between Buffalo <}> <-> and / - > <=> and </=> </}>

<{> <[> Detroit </[> between Windsor and Toronto

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#257:1:A> <[> Yes </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#258:1:B> It's exactly halfway so all the railroads converge there

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#259:1:A> Mhh hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#260:1:B> So it's a real railroad town
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#261:1:B> All the nice houses were built by railroad men

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#262:1:A> Is the railroad still active

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#263:1:B> No
<ICE-CAN:S1A-040#264:1:B> <}> <-> You know how </-> <=> you know how </=> </}> <{> <[> they

closed down railroads everywhere </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-040#265:1:A> <[> Yes yes that's right ya </[> </{> </I>
