<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#1:1> Greetings! </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#2:1> This year we're not embarrassed at all about sending a canned <}>

<-> XMAS </-> <+> Christmas </+> </}> greeting.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#3:1> We've both had expensive psychotherapy since writing last year's

letter, and we feel just fine now, thank you very much. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#4:1> No doubt you smirking Easterners ( everybody is an Easterner from

here) are enjoying <@> Queenville </@> 's recent bout of <}> <-> inclimate

</-> <+> inclement </+> </}> weather.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#5:1> Well, its not funny: it caused our winter crocuses to bloom late and

the December lawnbowling season to be postponed.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#6:1> At <@> 4444 Eggston </@> , we actually sandbagged the southeast corner

of our foundation to prevent the basement tenants from floating away with the

tide.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#7:1> But it's all over now and you're cold and we're not, so there. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#8:1> Renovations and gardening were an important part of our lives

again this year and we seem to have gotten better at both ( <}> <-> ie. </->

<+> i.e. </+> </}> nothing broken or killed).
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#9:1> <@> Mel </@> took out the old concrete retaining wall from the back

and filled things in with landscaping ties.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#10:1> This gives <@> Anne </@> more scope for madcap floral design next

year, now that the front garden has been planted ... and has survived.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#11:1> The highlight of the R&G season by far, though, was the back porch.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#12:1> This was our first tentative stab at indoor renovation, and we

planned to paint and put up shelves, which we did.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#13:1> But there was also a large hole to be repaired in the wall where - -

you'll remember this from last year's <}> <-> XMAS </-> <+> Christmas </+>

</}> letter - - we had to fix pipes which had burst in <@> Queenville </@> 's

first sustained cold spell since the last Ice Age.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#14:1> Well, you'd think that after ten years we'd get to know each other's

secret talents, but did <@> Mel </@> know that <@> Anne </@> could drywall

like Bob Vila?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#15:1> No, he didn't - - but she sure can.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#16:1> When <@> Mel </@> drywalls, the gyproc breaks, the tape shows and he

gets mud in his unmentionables.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#17:1> ( Not to mention drinking too much for weeks afterwards). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#18:1> <@> Anne </@> , on the other hand, just put on her little Beaver

Lumber apron and did the job before <@> Mel </@> could say <quote> " Let's

get someone in to do the job right, okay?" </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#19:1> Another good reason for us to stay married. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#20:1> In the jobs department, <@> Mel </@> is beavering away at being

an economic consultant to the B.C. Ministry of Finance.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#21:1> This will come as a surprise to people who thought he was a

librarian, but so it goes.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#22:1> He was and now he isn't: the world's a funny old place, as Margaret

Thatcher said recently.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#23:1> <@> Mel </@> 's job is to track the larger trends in the B.C. economy

and then publish his findings.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#24:1> He uses a procedure developed by the United Nations called " A System

of National Accounts".
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#25:1> This is amusing to those who know the trouble <@> Mel </@> has in

balancing his savings account, and will confirm everyone's suspicions yet

again about the competence of the nation's civil servants.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#26:1> <@> Anne </@> is still working on t***s <&> taxes </&> , also with

the Ministry of Finance.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#27:1> ( It's so cute: we get to take the bus together and everything.)
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#28:1> Don't blame her for that much-beloved t** <&> tax </&> , the GST - -

that was the other guys.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#29:1> These days she's working on a kind of t** <&> tax </&> that most

people like <}> <-> ie. </-> <+> i.e. </+> </}> using the t** <&> tax </&>

system to pursue environmental bad guys.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#30:1> She must have bankrupted a lot of unsuspecting businesses lately,

because she's up for a promotion. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#31:1> Unfortunately, our year was not without some sadness.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#32:1> Our first niece, Erin Elizabeth, ( <@> Steve </@> and <@> Sheena </@> 's

second child) died shortly after being born.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#33:1> Here's some other things that happened this year: </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#34:1> Our cat turned into Oprah: first skinny, then fat, then skinny

again, and now fat.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#35:1> We give up; </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#36:1> <@> Mel </@> 's grandfather from Wales was here for 3 weeks this

fall, to rave reviews; <@> Mel </@> 's grandfather helped to put double-digit

inflation into year's visitor statistics.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#37:1> GO AWAY!!!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#38:1> ( No, just kidding, we love you all); </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#39:1> The ranks of the unmarried was diminished by <@> Anne </@> 's

next-to-last single cousin <@> Marge </@> <}> <-> <w> gettin' </w> </-> <+>

getting </+> </}> hitched, and <@> Mel </@> 's cousin <@> Hugh </@> doing

likewise; Happily, the Childless Couples Club still has at least one charter

member; </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#40:1> <@> Mel </@> and <@> Anne </@> hiked ( and survived) the West

Coast Trail - - pictures at eleven. </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#41:2> Hi all, Well, here we go again for another year!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#42:2> The big events for 1991 were: the retirement of <@> Anne </@> 's

parents to <@> Queenville </@> and <@> Mel </@> & <@> Anne </@> 's extended

holiday in Thailand.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#43:2> ( One didn't necessarily cause the other, however.) </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#44:2> <@> Scott </@> and <@> Olga </@> <@> Roper </@> took the plunge

at the end of 1990, ending 45 years of employment at Canada <@> BigSave </@>

, where he ended his days as Chief Financial Officer.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#45:2> <@> Olga </@> , not being used to dealing with him for more than 3 or

4 hours at a time, set him to work planning for the Golden Years of their

lives together.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#46:2> Initially he favoured leaving Calgary for the simple pleasures of <@>

Blue Hills </@> , Saskatchewan, near where his family had homesteaded in the

1930's and where there was still some clearing to do on the north 40.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#47:2> <@> Olga </@> quietly nixed that, so between them they decided to

join that " hotbed of social rest", the retirement community of <@>

Queenville </@> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#48:2> <@> Mel </@> and <@> Anne </@> were platooned into finding them a

place to live.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#49:2> Unfortunately, <@> Mel </@> had no luck in finding an up-island

nursing home that would take them yet, so they opted for a pleasant rancher

in the chi-chi <@> Queenville </@> community of Broadmead.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#50:2> <@> Scott </@> and <@> Olga </@> have settled nicely into <@>

Queenville </@> life - - although settled may not really be accurate.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#51:2> Already this year they've flown to Winnipeg, Regina and Calgary,

driven to Arizona and California, and taken the fabled cruise through the

Inland Passage to Alaska. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#52:2> A few months later, <@> Anne </@> and <@> Mel </@> decided to

take that long holiday they've often talked about, to Southeast Asia.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#53:2> Their friend, <@> Laura Beiber </@> , has been teaching since 1990 at

the University of Khon Kaen in northeast Thailand, so they flew out in

September to join her until the middle of October. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#54:2> Thailand, for those of you who don't know much about it ( which

certainly included us before we left), is nestled in the Sea of Andaman

between Laos, Burma, Cambodia and Hunan Province in China.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#55:2> Its about the size of Texas and is home to about 53 million people,

over 10% of whom live in the teeming metropolis of Bangkok. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#56:2> Our trip divided roughly into 4 parts: culture shock in Bangkok;

playing amateur archaeologist in the North; getting lost in Isaan; and

slumming it on a southern beach. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#57:2> 1. Because most Thais live in the countryside, you could say "

there's Bangkok and then there's the rest of Thailand".
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#58:2> Bangkok is a big, sprawling, noisy, enthralling mass of people living

on top of each other, trying to muddle their way into being an oriental New

York.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#59:2> Everywhere, people are selling things ( often themselves) and

building things ( this is what 7 straight years of double digit economic

growth looks like), but at the same time, there seemed to be a calmness in

the chaos and a real joy in even the simplest of lives.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#60:2> One things that endeared us to Bangkok, and indeed to all of Thailand

to us, was that people there love to eat - - everywhere and constantly.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#61:2> And what food! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#62:2> 2. There is great history in Thailand, and once we got out of

Bangkok we thrilled to the sights of lonely wats ( <}> <-> ie. </-> <+> i.e.

</+> </}> temples) on distant hillsides and Buddha figures on practically

every street corner.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#63:2> Religion is very close to the people of Thailand, 95% of whom are

Buddhist, and we could feel the genuine veneration and sincerely-held values

wherever we went. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#64:2> 3. Because <@> Laura </@> lives in a remote part of Thailand (

<}> <-> ie. </-> <+> i.e. </+> </}> in Isaan, the northeastern provinces), we

got a chance to see parts of the country which very few foreigners see.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#65:2> We travelled on mudtracks in the mountains, by fan-tailed boat along

the Mekok River, and watched Burmese traders and functionaries exchange goods

as they had for millenia in the Golden Triangle, before heroin became the

main items of commerce. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#66:2> 4. After drinking deeply from the well of oriental civilization

we found an out-of-the-way island and lay around on the beach for a week,

recollecting ourselves.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#67:2> We made a couple of snorkeling trips and ventured to Kho Phi Phi Le

where, those of you who follow National Geographic specials may know, Thai

sea gypsies scramble up ricketty bamboo ladders to gather swallow's nest for

<w> birds' </w> nest soup. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#68:2> Okay, some other odds and ends: </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#69:2> * the cat is fine: he's a mere shadow of his former self, having

lost umpteen pounds at the <@> Roper-Charlton </@> Fat Cat Farm; </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#70:2> * we fit in some renovations in the house again this year: new

kitchen, a spiffy paint job for the outside of the house, and <@> Mel </@>

built the requisite compost boxes without which people couldn't giggle about

the granola belt out here; </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#71:2> * everybody's relatives are well: in fact, <@> Anne </@> 's Aunt

<@> Dori </@> joined the Great <@> Roper </@> exodus from the prairies to the

Wet Coast, arriving in <@> Queenville </@> in July; and </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#72:2> * Work is fine: <@> Anne </@> is continuing her climb up the

greasy ( but now politically correct) pole of B.C. government; <@> Mel </@>

is moving into a new position as tourism economist with the B.C. Ministry of

Finance; and * <@> Anne </@> 's brother <@> Steve </@> and his wife <@>

Sheena </@> are expecting in March.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#73:2> ( Whew, dodged that bullet for another year!) </p> </I>


<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#74:3> Ho Ho Ho ... Hum </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#75:3> We're getting a bit complacent here in the editorial office,

aren't we? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#76:3> If house renovations were the prevailing theme of our last three

annual epistles, it looks like babies will dominate from now on.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#77:3> Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Footloose and Fancy Free have wriggled and squirmed

out of parenthood ( " We're not settled yet." " <@> Steve </@> and <@> Sheena

</@> should really have a baby first." " A baby would clash with the

furniture" - - we've used them all) for who knows how many years now, but the

you-know-what has finally hit the fan.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#78:3> Life as we know it will soon come to an end.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#79:3> A baby is upon us.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#80:3> Well, soon, anyway.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#81:3> As of this moment, <@> Anne </@> is 32 weeks pregnant and will

deliver the goods on or around February 5, 1993.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#82:3> No doubt the blessed event will be in between meetings of the

Provincial Budget Committee and in time for her to write a briefing note on

some arcane policy issue, while Mike Harcourt and the legislative reporters

assist <@> Mel </@> with the labour breathing.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#83:3> Then it's out with negotiating PIP grants and in with managing POOP

pants for <@> A & M </@> and ?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#84:3> ( Isn't it ironic that A has been developing a waste discharge

program with the Ministry of Environment these last 7 months?) </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#85:3> For the record, Plan A has <@> Anne </@> taking maternity leave

until August or so.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#86:3> <@> Mel </@> is then going to take a six-month leave of absence to do

the male bonding thing.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#87:3> After that, the child will be offered a choice between getting a job

or moving out.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#88:3> ( Or maybe, <@> A </@> & <@> M </@> will move out.)
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#89:3> Names?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#90:3> We were hoping you wouldn't ask.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#91:3> We like the native practice of naming it after the first thing the

mother sees after the child's birth.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#92:3> Stirrup <@> Roper-Charlton </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#93:3> Obstetrician <@> Roper-Charlton </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#94:3> Kind of has a ring to it, doesn't it?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#95:3> Really, who knows what we're going to call it - - we're still in

denial over the whole thing, for crying out loud.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#96:3> ( For what it's worth, <@> Anne </@> 's father has suggested Rupert

for a boy and Walpirga for a girl.)
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#97:3> Also in the baby department, this year marked the arrival of <@> Anne

</@> 's second nephew, <@> James Paul </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#98:3> The little tyke just might be cuter than his perfect brother, <@>

Jake </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#99:3> ( We'll never be able to compete.) </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-013#100:3> 1992 wasn't as busy as some years in the visitor department, but

new babies seemed to be a common feature of several of our guests as well.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#101:3> By contrast, this year we had our first and probably last visitor

coming to escape their family.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#102:3> <@> Anne </@> 's friend <@> Judith </@> came for a weekend without

her husband and 2 children and did nothing but loaf around, read, watch

movies, eat and sleep in late.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-013#103:3> At the end she said she felt a little guilty, but wondered if we

might have room in January ... </p> </I>
