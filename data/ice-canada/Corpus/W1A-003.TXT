<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-003#1:1> On July 1st 1990, Canada day, several Canadian rock bands gathered

outside of Barrie Ontario to perform a Canada Day " Celebration".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#2:1> The final act of the day was the Box, a band from Qu&eacute;bec.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#3:1> They tried to make the point that despite the recent failure of the

Meech Lake Accord, we Canadians have to plough onwards.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#4:1> The boohs and hisses which erupted were embarrassing.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#5:1> Had the failure of the Meech Lake Accord, a proposed constitutional

amendment which would symbolically bring Qu&eacute;bec into the Constitution

and increase the powers of the provinces, left the country with wounds that

would not heal? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-003#6:1> This paper will argue that considering the factors which led to

the failure of the Meech Lake Accord and the attitudes which have developed

since that failure no accommodations are possible to salvage the existing

Canadian Confederation.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#7:1> The factors which led to the failure of Meech left the opposing and

appreciative factions too resolute in their stances to reach accommodation.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#8:1> Also important in analyzing the elements which lead to the failure of

Meech was that Meech was a <b> Constitutional </b> amendment and therefore

debate about it was tainted by ideological symbolism.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#9:1> The wounds incurred to Canadian pan-nationalism by Meech were not new

ones; rather they were old wounds reopened.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#10:1> The feelings which were cultivated in both Qu&eacute;bec and English

Canada during the separatist movement and the language policy debates of the

1960s and 1970s, by the ' 82 Constitution Act, reached a boiling point with

the June 23rd failure of Meech.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#11:1> These extreme feelings will not be swept under the carpet by either

side in the conflict.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#12:1> So intense was this boiling point that both pro and anti Meech

exponents will remain adamant in their demands; stalemate. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-003#13:1> The factors which led to the failure of Meech ranged from the

traditional English-French relations debate to dislike for the actual

provisions of the accord. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-003#14:1> In any negotiations for concessions it becomes extremely

difficult to achieve agreement when one group enters the negotiations with

inflexible demands.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#15:1> Such was the case with Qu&eacute;bec's position regarding their

symbolic entrance into the Constitution.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#16:1> Qu&eacute;bec made it clear in 1986 what their requirements were for

them to become a member of the Constitution.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#17:1> Gil R&eacute;millard, then Qu&eacute;bec Minister of Intergovernment

Affairs, laid down their demands as follows: ( 1) explicit recognition of

Qu&eacute;bec as a distinct society; ( 2) the recognition of a right to

constitutional veto; ( 3) a limitation on the federal spending power; ( 4)

Qu&eacute;bec's participation in appointing judges to the Supreme Court; and

( 5) a guarantee of increased powers in matters of immigration. <fnr> 1

</fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#18:1> Qu&eacute;bec felt as if they ( it) were ( was) wronged in 1982 and

they now had their demands to make up for that wrong and they were not going

to relinquish them.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#19:1> After all the federal <}> <-> gov't </-> <+> government </+> </}> did

somewhat have Qu&eacute;bec lean into the blow in ' 82.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#20:1> During the separatist campaign of 1980 the federal government told

the people of Qu&eacute;bec that if they said no to separation then the

federal government would negotiate a constitution.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#21:1> When such a constitution was prepared it was incompatible to the

needs of Qu&eacute;bec.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#22:1> So four years later the Qu&eacute;bec <}> <-> gov't </-> <+>

government </+> </}> was very adamant in the provision that they felt were

necessary to forget the sucker punch of ' 82. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-003#23:1> Many Canadians felt that the proposals within Meech Lake were too

decentralizing and that the amendment would destroy a pan-Canada which ranged

from sea to sea.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#24:1> Alan Cairns wrote that <quote> " pan-Canadianism, support for the

Charter, belief in a leading role for the central government, and a deep

uneasiness at the provincializing thrust of the Accord were generously

represented, indeed probably dominant, among the groups and individuals that

appeared before the Joint Committee and in other fora outside of

Qu&eacute;bec," </quote> . <fnr> 2 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#25:1> To achieve the largely symbolic effect of drawing Qu&eacute;bec into

the Canadian Constitutional family the Accord would reshape federalism to

what many believed to perverse levels.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#26:1> Many Canadians felt that the catch was not worth the high cost of the

bait. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-003#27:1> The Accord was also objectionable on the grounds of how it was

created.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#28:1> The future of Canadian federalism and the framework of a nation were

shaped by eleven men behind closed doors.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#29:1> The <}> <-> Acoord's </-> <+> Accord's </+> </}> origin had two

negative effects for the Accord.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#30:1> The first, as discussed, was a resentment of the decentralizing

proposals for the Country.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#31:1> The Premiers had a conflict of interest in that they were men elected

to get results within their provinces, yet they were negotiating the

distribution of power between the provinces and the central government.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#32:1> How could they do anything but want more power with which to take

results to their voters?
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#33:1> Roger Gibbins, as quoted by Cairns, wrote that Meech <quote> "

appeared to be a document drawn up by provincial governments for provincial

governments, the result of a constitutional contest in which the federal

government was a referee but not a player aggressively pursing its own

interest and vision" </quote> . <fnr> 3 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#34:1> Increased power for the provinces, decentralization, was a natural

consequence of ten provincial players and one federal player negotiating

constitutional reform.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#35:1> The second unpopular effect that the origin of Meech produced was the

resentment that certain interest groups felt at not being included in the

negotiations.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#36:1> Donna Grescher maintained that the political battles of the previous

round of the Constitutional reform were <quote> " still too fresh in the

memories of national women's organizations for them not to be suspicious of a

deal struck in private by eleven men" </quote> . <fnr> 4 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#37:1> Constitutional reform only rears its head every so often and thus

interest groups are going to push as hard as possible to have their interest

represented at any time reform is proposed.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#38:1> Furthermore it is important to consider that, as Richard Simeon,

wrote <quote> " the stakes of constitutional politics are high, and high

stakes politics are likely to be ideological politics" </quote> . <fnr> 5

</fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#39:1> Not only did the Accord offend those who were neglected recognition

but it also threatened the existing recognition of constitutional groups.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#40:1> Cairns considered Meech to be a rebuff for aboriginals, women's

groups, and members of the non-Charter communities. <fnr> 6 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#41:1> Cairns quoted George Erasmus who maintained that <quote> " If you

upgrade the rights of the French and do not do the same to the rights of

everyone else, by definition, you have just lowered else's" </quote> . <fnr>

7 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#42:1> Opposition from the aboriginal corner on this point would reach fatal

levels for the Meech Lake Accord. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-003#43:1> Not only did some Canadians deplore the decentralizing aspects of

Meech's proposed changes to the amending formula, but it was also feared that

strengthening the amending formula would weaken the rights of citizens.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#44:1> The Charter can be seen as the <w> citizens' </w> element of the

constitution while the amending formula maintains the supremacy of the

Parliament.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#45:1> Cairns expressed his fear with the following quote: <X> <quote> the

tension between bringing the citizenry into the constitutional order via the

Charter and firmly placing the same citizenry on the sidelines when

constitutional amendments are undertaken might lie dormant if formal

constitutional change was only a rare event, ...
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#X46:1> However, Meech promises the reverse with its requirement of annual

constitutional conference and the concomitant assumption that constitutional

fine tuning is an ever-present requirement ( Cairns 174) </quote> </X> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#47:1> Regardless of any English/French quarrel certain Canadians felt as if

the proposed changes to the amending formula were threatening to the rights

of Canadians. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-003#48:1> It has been argued that some Meech opponents rejected it not for

its actual provisions, but out of retaliation for old English/French wounds.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#49:1> McRoberts wrote <quote> " Clearly, what they ( Qu&eacute;bec

Anglophones) found so offensive in the measure ( Bill 101) was its symbolism:

the denial of full equality between English and French with <}> <-> <.> Que

</.> </-> <+> Qu&eacute;bec </+> </}> , " </quote> . <fnr> 8 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#50:1> Statistics have revealed that the French language was declining

outside of Qu&eacute;bec.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#51:1> Yet the rest of Canada watched as Qu&eacute;bec passed a Bill which

<b> prohibited </b> certain usage of one language.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#52:1> Some Canadians feared that to constitutionally empower a province

that was already repressing one language to <quote> " preserve and promote"

</quote> their language and culture would be like giving a terrorist extra

bullets. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-003#53:1> Not only are the factors which led to the demise of Meech

important to the future of the country but also the attitudes which have

developed since then. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-003#54:1> Considering the failure of the Meech Lake Accord the existing

perception in Qu&eacute;bec cannot be anything but one of acrimony.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#55:1> Qu&eacute;becers cannot help but feel that in a decade of

constitutional politics they have been slapped in the face twice.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#56:1> It has already been explained how the 1982 constitution was a blow to

Qu&eacute;bec.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#57:1> Once again, with the failure of Meech, Qu&eacute;bec leaned into the

blow.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#58:1> In 1986 Qu&eacute;bec laid down the conditions which had to be met

for Qu&eacute;bec to enter into the Canadian Constitution.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#59:1> One year later these demands were met and the Meech Lake Accord was

signed.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#60:1> All seemed well.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#61:1> Then three years later the Accord was rejected.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#62:1> Qu&eacute;bec had been teased into expecting a kiss and instead

received a slap.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#63:1> Qu&eacute;bec dug in their heels as a result of the egg on their

faces.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#64:1> The obvious product of their tenacity will be a refusal to demand

anything less than what they demanded in ' 86. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-003#65:1> Quite diametrically opposed to the tenacious stance of

Qu&eacute;bec was the position of many Canadians that any future agreements

would have to be less decentralizing.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#66:1> <quote> " Indeed, one of the srongest reactions against Meech Lake

comes from Canadians who felt that their national government and national

community were weakened" </quote> , wrote Cairns. <fnr> 9 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#67:1> Unfortunately Meech opponents seemed as uncompromising in their

protection of the existing federalist distribution of power. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-003#68:1> As unfortunate as it may be, the Qu&eacute;bec people were prey

to a fundamental misconception about the failure of the Accord.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#69:1> Many Qu&eacute;bec armchair political analysts felt that the rest of

Canada rejected them, not the Accord itself.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#70:1> Simeon belived that <quote> " the stakes of constitutional politics

are high, and high stakes politics are likely to be ideological politics"

</quote> . <fnr> 10 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#71:1> It is unfortunate that Quebecers felt rejected for the wrong reasons

considering the <quote> " high stakes" </quote> involved. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-003#72:1> Another unfortunate, yet significant, misunderstanding was

developed by the Meech opponents.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#73:1> As this essay has already shown many Canadians resented the

decentralizing thrust of the Accord.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#74:1> However, many Canadians also felt that Meech was another example of

Qu&eacute;bec asking for too much.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#75:1> The misunderstanding lay in the fact that the decentralizing

provisions of the Accord applied to all provinces, not just Qu&eacute;bec.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-003#76:1> The failure of Meech also heightened the problem of regionalism.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#77:1> The resultant talk of Qu&eacute;bec separation spurned comments of

regional problems from other provinces.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#78:1> John Buchannan felt that perhaps he might add to the neurosis of the

Canadian psyche by claiming that his province might just separate too.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#79:1> He seemed to feel that he would grace America with the " blessings"

of his province. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-003#80:1> Considering the factors which led to the failure of Meech and the

attitudes which have developed since that failure the die has been

irreversibly cast toward Qu&eacute;bec sovereignty. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-003#81:1> There exist two factors which make the failure of Meech a fatal

blow in the age old Qu&eacute;bec/English Canada clash.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#82:1> As previously stressed Constitutional politics are <quote> " high

stakes/ideological" </quote> politics.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#83:1> A Constitution is the fundamental law of a land; a legal blueprint

for a society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#84:1> Proposed changes to such a blueprint naturally carry the panic that

the building will be changed.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#85:1> People are always skeptical of change and the intensity of that

skepticism is directly related to not just the proposed change but also what

is to be changed.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#86:1> Thus, changing a Constitution is an extremely dangerous venture.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#87:1> Second to the fatality of the blow is the fact that, for

Qu&eacute;bec, it is unexpected.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#88:1> In 1987 Qu&eacute;bec was expecting a kiss they thought that they

deserved.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#89:1> Three years later they took a punch on the chin.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#90:1> The blow dealt to the psyche of Qu&eacute;bec by the failure of Meech

came from a strong hand as Meech was a proposed change to the Constitution;

the intensity of the blow was heightened as it was unexpected. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-003#91:1> The failure of Meech will bring Qu&eacute;bec to the canvass;

Qu&eacute;bec will seek sovereignty.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-003#92:1> However, the factors which led to that failure and the attitudes

which developed since then discouraged Qu&eacute;bec from seeking a rematch.
