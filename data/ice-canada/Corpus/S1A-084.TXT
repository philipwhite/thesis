<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-084#183:1:A> And now she's taking you
<ICE-CAN:S1A-084#184:1:A> She's going with you isn't she

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-084#185:1:B> No she says well if we don't find anyone else I guess we're

going to have to wait till spring <unclear> word </unclear> is what she said
<ICE-CAN:S1A-084#186:1:B> But it's a lot of work to drive out someplace spend <{1> <[1> a

back figure it out </[1> <,> ya figure out
<ICE-CAN:S1A-084#187:1:B> <{2> <[2> write it all out </[2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-084#188:1:A> <[1> I thought that was pretty weird sort of like expecting

you to do that </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-084#189:1:A> <[2> But she said it out </[2> </{2> loud

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-084#190:1:A> Like she said it to me and uhm I know she said it to you too

<ICE-CAN:S1A-084#194:1:B> That's how I feel
<ICE-CAN:S1A-084#195:1:B> So <,,> you know that's why like all these estimates I'm doing is

like ya well uh <,,> can you wait six months you know or can you wait
<ICE-CAN:S1A-084#196:1:B> <{> <[> Most people </[> would say well it's a little ridiculous

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-084#198:1:B> I'll go find someone else
