<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#2:1> <h> A good breeder should be a new puppy owner's best resource. </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#3:1> <it> by Chris Walkowicz </it>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#4:1> <bold> Most enthusiasts start in the same spot: </bold> the

beginning.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#5:1> We buy a pet.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#6:1> The pet needs training.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#7:1> We enrol in a class, then join a club and, from there, pick up

momentum. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#8:1> One of the things I love most in dogs is helping newcomers.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#9:1> They're excited and, at the same time, a bit apprehensive.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#10:1> During the first few months of ownership, the best thing we can do is

advise and encourage.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#11:1> We must be available to answer the everyday questions that all new

owners have.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#12:1> When the pup is their first show prospect, however, there are a few

more tricks to the trade. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#13:1> <h> <bold> TRAINING </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#14:1> Encourage new owners to take a class ASAP.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#15:1> Steer them to the right type of class, depend <l> ing on whether the

pup is heading toward the breed or obedience ring.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#16:1> When the right class is unavailable, any kind is better than nothing.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#17:1> Puppy kindergarten is helpful in teaching the basics: stand, stay,

walk. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#18:1> Owners can practise baiting, gaiting in various patterns and

stacking at home or with local fanciers.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#19:1> Remind them puppies tire and bore easily, so training sessions should

be short and fun. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#20:1> Suggest the right kind of leash and collar, and tell them the

puppy needs to like what he's doing.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#21:1> The combination of first-time handler / young puppy makes for some

chal <l> lenging sessions.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#22:1> Practice makes perfect. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#23:1> If you live in the area, it's helpful if you can also enrol in

the class or at least attend a few sessions.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#24:1> Then you can give tips.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#25:1> Some breeders invite local buyers over to their house for handling or

training classes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#26:1> When you're sending the puppy across the province or half-way

around the world, you'll have to make do with articles and a suggested

reading list.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#27:1> Phone instructions are helpful, but most people retain more when

they're given a demonstration.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#28:1> Look through your national club list for some <l> one in their area.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#29:1> Find the closest all-breed - or, even better, specialty - club and en

<l> courage them to join. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#30:1> <h> <bold> RAISING </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#31:1> Grooming for the pet encompasses the basics: nails, ears,

brushing and bathing.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#32:1> Intrica <l> cies are handled by professionals.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#33:1> But grooming the show prospect is much more demanding. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#34:1> The puppy must learn to stand on a grooming table with its head

in a 'noose.'
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#35:1> Sellers should demonstrate proper tools and methods of layered

brushing, trimming or clipping. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#36:1> Through trial and error, exhibitors work their way through

various shampoos and conditioners.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#37:1> What to pick?
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#38:1> Shampoo for bronze, black or white; fleas or medicated; deodorizing,

scented or non-scented.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#39:1> Cream rinse, hot oil or non-tangle.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#40:1> It's all so con <l> fusing!
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#41:1> The voice of experience can save the day, the coat and the budget.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#42:1> Then there's the choice of bristle, pin or slicker brush.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#43:1> And to comb or not to comb.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#44:1> Without instructions, a novice is lost.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#45:1> Some breeders offer to groom their 'grandpups' until the buyer feels

comfortable doing it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#46:1> Show conditioning includes good nutri <l> tion.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#47:1> Using on-sale store brands or switch <l> ing brands weekly isn't

going to make that coat shine or trim that tummy.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#48:1> Give them your secret recipe for tempting bait. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#49:1> Exercise builds up muscle tone.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#50:1> Breeders can advise when and how to conduct work-outs.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#51:1> Inform buyers about the pros and cons of using bicycles, jogging and

so on. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#52:1> <h> <bold> SHOWS </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#53:1> I suggest buyers test the waters at a match, where a lot of us

learned the ropes.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#54:1> Things are more relaxed, and other exhibitors are happy to offer

help.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#55:1> By the time we intro <l> duce our proteg&eacute;es to the first dog

show, they're wide-eyed with excitement. </p> <O> photograph </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#56:1> I encourage buyers to do their own han <l> dling.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#57:1> Watching them move the dog allows me to offer hints to slow down or

take lon <l> ger steps.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#58:1> Otherwise, I offer to handle the dog, or recommend an alternative.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#59:1> Many pet owners, when considering ex <l> hibiting, are concerned

with the expense or the amount of travelling involved.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#60:1> Usu <l> ally, I send the owner a list of area shows and make several

recommendations.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#61:1> Start <l> ing slowly is the key.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#62:1> Once they've a taste of the win and hold that first blue ribbon,

they'll often ask <it> you </it> what shows are next! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#63:1> In their enthusiasm, some hate to take a break during the teenage

gawkies.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#64:1> My sug <l> gestion is to show the dog during puppy <l> hood, take a

hiatus during the 'teens,' and bring the dog back out when he is mature. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#65:1> <h> <bold> LEARNING NEVER STOPS </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#66:1> Sometimes eager novices try something new or learn a better way

to accomplish the job, and can show us a thing or two.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#67:1> You <it> can </it> teach old dogs new tricks! </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#68:2> <h> <bold> Screening techniques </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#69:2> <it> by Penny Manning </it>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#70:2> <h> Garnering as much information as possible about an incoming dog

can assist you in making the best placement. </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#71:2> <bold> Though well-run programs practise </bold> "

crisis-proofing" by developing and follow <l> ing policies and standards,

it's wise to keep in mind the " 80-20 rule," in which 80 per cent of problems

arise from 20 per cent of the causes.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#72:2> By far, the prevailing cause of trouble in rescue organizations is

poor communication.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#73:2> Consider the rescue vol <l> unteer who asked why an owner wanted to

give up his dog.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#74:2> <mention> " Allergies" </mention> was the answer.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#75:2> Presuming a family member could not tol <l> erate canine dander,

imagine the volun <l> teer's surprise when she discovered it was the <it> dog

</it> that had severe allergies requiring intensive veterinary treatment and

adopters willing to provide specialized care.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#76:2> How much easier it would have been to ask a few pertinent questions

and be prepared! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#77:2> Effective screening practices can help keep the bad apples out of

your program and reduce the risk of inappropriate dogs being placed in

unsuitable homes.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#78:2> For each incoming rescue dog, there are a min <l> imum of two

essential conversations, dur <l> ing which vital questions must be asked: the

intake call where the animal is evalu <l> ated for adoptability and the

placement call, where a prospective owner is assessed to ensure he / she will

provide an appro <l> priate home for your rescue dog. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#79:2> The screening process need not be an interrogation.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#80:2> In fact, it works much better if it's considered a " friendly chat

with a purpose."
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#81:2> The end result should reveal the real reasons a dog is being turned

in and exactly why a prospective adopter wishes to own a second-hand dog from

your program. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#82:2> For incoming rescue dogs it is essential to determine the dog's

physical description ( age, sex, size); veterinary history ( medica <l> tion,

illnesses); behaviour ( temperament, manners, training); ownership ( is the

per <l> son legally able to turn over the dog?); and reason(s) for wishing to

place the dog in rescue ( why is it unwanted?). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#83:2> It is more difficult to find out these details about dogs in

animal shelters, but often, in the case of owner turn-in, shelter staff will

have some background information. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#84:2> Prospective adopters re <l> quire a completed applica <l> tion

form on file detailing basic information ( physical environment, number and

ages of children, other pets, work hours, etc.).
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#85:2> It's helpful to ask poten <l> tial adopters to include a short

description of their ideal dog and their reasons for adopting.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#86:2> Further interview(s) should fo <l> cus on their beliefs about raising

and train <l> ing dogs, and their past experiences, as well as reviewing the

application information. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#87:2> <h> <bold> EVALUATING THE MESSAGE </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#88:2> Since most people have a listening effi <l> ciency of just 25 per

cent ( the remaining 75 per cent of information is ignored, mis <l>

interpreted or forgotten), it takes a great deal of effort to really hear

what is being said.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#89:2> Always take notes during a screening conversation and prepare a

checklist of frequently asked questions.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#90:2> Don't make assumptions; jumping to conclusions and not asking enough

questions to properly evaluate the situation invites unwanted sur <l> prises.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#91:2> A " fenced yard" to some can mean decorative railing with spaces a

cow could walk through. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#92:2> Insist on clarity.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#93:2> If the speaker's meaning is vague, don't be afraid to ask for clarifi

<l> cation, even if it takes several attempts - <quote> " I'm not sure I

understand what you mean by 'Sparky can't be trusted with kids' - can you

explain?" </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#94:2> Ask open-ended questions that invite descriptive answers, as

opposed to " closed" questions that tend to result in a " yes" or " no"

answer.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#95:2> <quote> " Does your dog bite?" </quote> will often be answered

negatively ( some people do not consider nips or grabs to be real biting).
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#96:2> <quote> " Tell me the things that you should not do with your dog"

</quote> may lead you to the response you are looking for. </p> <O>

photograph </O> <O> This pound-rescue Borzol is now living in a new loving

home. </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#97:2> Watch for " red flag" phrases.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#98:2> Learn to hear warning signals, as there may be underlying reasons for

placing a dog: <quote> " I need to get rid of him before my husband gets

home" </quote> could be a hint that Fido is the pawn in a marriage breakup.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#99:2> <quote> " Our last dog, Buffy, was hit by a car" </quote> might mean

a pro <l> spective adopter does not have a particu <l> larly healthy

philosophy about leashes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#100:2> Listen for non-verbal cues.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#101:2> The tone of the speaker's voice can provide a world of information.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#102:2> Is the message being deliv <l> ered in an insistent tone?
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#103:2> Is it pleading or unsympathetic?
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#104:2> Sudden subject changes and interruptions can mean you've hit upon a

tender topic.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#105:2> Even the pregnant pause after you ask an important question can be a

telltale sign of someone frantically trying to devise the right answer. </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#106:3> <h> <bold> Standardizing the standards </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#107:3> <it> by Andrew Brace </it>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#108:3> <h> Studying breed histories can help avoid exaggerations. </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#109:3> <bold> As the world becomes a smaller and </bold> smaller place,

so the dog fancy appears to become more cosmopolitan and interna <l> tional.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#110:3> The ease and speed of air travel is now such that breeders from one

country can travel at their leisure to view stock at the other end of the

world, while judges regularly officiate in many countries other than their

homeland. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#111:3> The question of standardizing the breed standards seems to be a

regular item on the agenda of the much-talked about, but possibly grossly

overrated, World Congres <l> ses of Kennel Clubs, and there is obvious

concern that the written blueprint for cer <l> tain breeds varies

considerably from one governing body to another. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#112:3> In reality, any differences in wording of breed standards are

very much secondary to the differences that exist physically, where breeds

have been developed in such a way that breed type differs quite dramatically

from country to country. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#113:3> It is a fact that while some breed stan <l> dards may read

differently on an intercon <l> tinental basis, their essence is the same, and

little harm is done by the variation in expression.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#114:3> Yet even so, some breeds have unequivocally gone off in a different

direc <l> tion from the mainstream in some coun <l> tries, the reason being

fashion or a shift in priorities.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#115:3> Breeders may choose to develop certain features of a breed to the

point of exaggeration; that is their choice.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#116:3> But they should never forget that they should be breeding to a

standard that was developed by the founding fathers of that breed, each

clause of which was included for a definite functional reason.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#117:3> It is for this reason that breeders should make it their business to

study the history of their breed in the great <l> est possible detail, and

this is where so many present-day breeders fall down. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#118:3> Given that different countries have devel <l> oped certain

breeds to suit their own tastes - albeit, in some cases, while still

remaining within the often-generous parameters of the existing breed standard

- a major prob <l> lem arises when judges are invited from overseas,

especially from the breed's coun <l> try of origin. </p> <O> photograph </O>

<O> This British / Scandinavian Golden Retriever differs in type from his

North America counterparts. </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#119:3> If we think of British breeds that have been 'refined' in other

lands, the most-often-cited example is, not surprisingly, the Eng <l> lish

Springer Spaniel in the United States and Canada.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#120:3> While one must accept that the modern transatlantic Springer has ac

<l> quired a definite 'look,' I cannot help won <l> dering whether or not

this is the result of markings, presentation and handling styles, rather than

major structural differences.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-014#121:3> Personally, I find the Rough Collies, Shet <l> land Sheepdogs and

Golden Retrievers across the Atlantic to be rather more differ <l> ent than

the British ideal, and these are just a few of the breeds that spring instant

<l> ly to mind. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#122:3> When clubs invite overseas judges to judge breeds that are

native to them, do they expect them to judge as they would at home, looking

for the same type, or would they rather the judges change their basic

perception of the breed and adapt their eye to suit the local dogs? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-014#123:3> This is one of the hardest jobs that can face any judge, and

they must really be true to themselves if their integrity is to re <l> main

intact. <O> rest of paragraph </O> </p> </I>
