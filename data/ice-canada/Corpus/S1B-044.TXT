<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#1:1:A> Well it sounds like your brother <,> upfront

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#2:1:B> <O> laugh </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#3:1:A> Uhm
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#4:1:A> <}> <-> But </-> <=> But </=> </}> <}> <-> that </-> <=> that </=>

<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#5:1:A> <}> <-> Or </-> <=> Or </=> </}> would you rather not <{> <[> do it

again </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#6:1:B> <[> Well I've always </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#7:1:B> I've always pretty well you know produced myself <{> <[> <}>

<-> with </-> <=> with </=> </}> </[> my brother helping me

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#8:1:A> <[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#9:1:B> But <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> really relied upon uh some

other people uhm to help me through it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#10:1:B> Uh I hired a vocal coach to help me through some of the vocals
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#11:1:B> <@> Harry McCormack </@> and uh
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#12:1:B> Like I said my brother Joe was with me when I did a lot of the

overdubs uh
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#13:1:B> I relied a lot on the musicians you know <}> <-> to </-> <=> uh <,>

to </=> </}> be playing certain things and for me to be able to catch them in

moments

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#14:1:A> Hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#15:1:B> So it wasn't like I was there alone with a midi machine and a

computer

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#16:1:A> Yeah

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#17:1:B> Trying to do it all myself

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#18:1:A> Uhm hmm
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#19:1:A> Tell me about the vocal coach
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#20:1:A> <}> <-> That </-> <=> That </=> </}> <}> <-> inter </-> <=>

interests </=> </}> me because phrasing is crucial in this genre <{> <[> of

singing </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#21:1:B> <[> It is </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#22:1:B> It is
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#23:1:B> It's
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#24:1:B> What I found out
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#25:1:B> <{> <[> What I was </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#26:1:A> <[> People call Sinatra a genius <,> well </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#27:1:B> That's right
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#28:1:B> That's right and you know it's your timing and how much you sing or

don't sing is very crucial to songs as such
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#29:1:B> And <@> Harry McCormack </@> was uh
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#30:1:B> I had a couple of problems with some songs <,> uhm to get through

them
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#31:1:B> Cos I wasn't sure where to inflect my voice
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#32:1:B> <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> was seeming to over blow it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#33:1:B> I used too much voice too much passion to the point where I was

just killing it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#34:1:B> And then I'd go back the other way and it was too flaccid
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#35:1:B> So <}> <-> he </-> <,,> <=> he </=> </}> really got me through it

<unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#36:1:B> One of them was I Die a Little More Each Day
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#37:1:B> It was a very difficult song to sing because of the content of the

lyric
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#38:1:B> Each line
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#39:1:B> I mean how do you sing <quote> the black drums leaking in their

graves </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#40:1:B> <O> remainder of song lyric </O>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#41:1:B> It's very difficult to sing that

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#42:1:A> Carried away emotionally <?> <unclear> if you </unclear> </?>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#43:1:B> Yeah you can get

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#45:1:B> <[> You know </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#46:1:B> So <}> <-> you're tending </-> <=> you tend to </=> </}> want

to pull back but
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#47:1:B> He came up with a lot of good uhm <,,> good hints
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#48:1:B> He told me every line has to have its own colour
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#49:1:B> Because the melody is somewhat repetitive and the things that's

really changing the colour are the lyrics so you have to go with the lyric
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#50:1:B> And we just horsed around in the studio <}> <-> and </-> <=> and

</=> </}> uh <}> <-> his </-> <=> his </=> </}> attention <}> <-> to </-> <=>

to </=> </}> detail really paid off

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#51:1:A> <}> <-> Is </-> <=> Is </=> </}> it a matter of concentration

too

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#52:1:B> Well it's also a matter of paying attention
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#53:1:B> And a matter of getting in tune with what you're really trying to

say

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#54:1:A> Yeah

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#55:1:B> I wrote Die a Little More Each Day two three years ago
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#56:1:B> And I believe if I would have done a vocal right there I probably

would have had it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#57:1:B> <{> <[> But after three years </[> <}> <-> I forgot what the </->

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#59:1:A> <[> Uhm </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#60:1:B> I didn't know what it was anymore
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#61:1:B> And uh I knew <}> <-> this </-> <=> this </=> </}> nice lyric here

was written
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#62:1:B> And it was time to do a vocal
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#63:1:B> But uh <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> couldn't get into <{> <[> the

emotion </[>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#64:1:B>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#65:1:A> <[> That immediacy </[> </{>

into it and into it and into it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#72:1:B> I remember when I finally got the vocal
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#73:1:B> I tapped into it and I felt it again
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#74:1:B> My heart started palpitating and I started feeling like <,> I

really feel this pain
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#75:1:B> And I really do feel that because these things are done to

ourselves and to earth and so on and so forth <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}>

really do feel the ache

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#76:1:A> Hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#77:1:B> And then the vocal started coming alive

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#78:1:A> Ironically it must be a great feeling though to <}> <->

capture </-> <=> capture </=> </}> <}> <-> that </-> <=> that </=> </}>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#81:1:A> Yeah

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#82:1:B> That is the danger sometimes of living with a song for more

than <,> a couple of years

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#83:1:A> Tell me about the show coming up at the Spectrum
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#84:1:A> Montrealers are going to see a different uh <{> <[> Gino Vinelli

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#85:1:B> <[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#86:1:A> Now this is exciting

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#88:1:B> Yeah
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#89:1:B> Well you know <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> wouldn't consider

myself <}> <-> a </-> <=> a </=> </}> artist

<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#96:1:B> And we'll have various guests from the jazz festival

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#98:1:A> Can you tell me who they are yet

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#99:1:B> Well <}> <-> we're </-> <=> we're </=> </}> talking to a <{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#102:1:B> I guarantee you that
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#103:1:B> Uh

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#104:1:A> Cos I know Joe Williams is coming this year

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#105:1:B> Interesting
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#106:1:B> Well it's a question of working out the timing

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#107:1:A> Yeah <O> laugh </O> all right

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#108:1:B> But uh it'll be <}> <-> a </-> <=> a </=> </}> night <,>

basically <,> where <}> <-> I'm </-> <=> I think I'd </=> </}> like to

communicate to people on a different level than I have in the past

</}> see some of the or hear some of the changes I've been through as a

person or <,,> as someone they've maybe followed for a few years
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#112:1:B> And to see if it mirrors their lives
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#113:1:B> And to make it a lot more uhm naked than it's ever been

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#114:1:A> Do you rush to embrace that feeling of the way <}> <-> you're

</-> <=> you're </=> </}> going to be <{> <[> out there on stage </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#115:1:B> <[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#116:1:A> Cos it's a lot different from studio isn't it

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#117:1:B> It is
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#118:1:B> But you know I uh
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#119:1:B> In the last uh couple of months I've actually been with uh a

couple of musicians and we've done this <,,> over some cities in the United

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#120:1:A> Tell me about uh the tap dancing <}> <-> in </-> <=> uhm in

</=> </}> Fallen in Love
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#121:1:A> That's not you obviously

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#122:1:B> No no it's <{> <[> Gregory Hines </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#123:1:A> <[> The great Gregory Hines </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#124:1:A> How'd you get him to do that

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#125:1:B> I just asked him <O> laugh </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#126:1:A> Oh and he said <{> <[> <yeah sure  </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#127:1:B> <[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#128:1:A> Yeah

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#129:1:B> Well he wanted to hear the tape
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#130:1:B> And I said uhm
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#131:1:B> Well <}> <-> what </-> <=> it </=> </}> came about in the studio
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#132:1:B> And <}> <-> it was </-> <=> it was </=> </}> originally a drum

solo
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#133:1:B> And because we were trying to think of unique ideas uh I said to

myself uh
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#134:1:B> Someone mentioned that it reminded them of a Fred Astaire type

track
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#135:1:B> Something you know <,> a modernized thirties or forties song
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#136:1:B> I said uhm how about a tap solo
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#137:1:B> I said well who better Gregory Hines
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#138:1:B> So I got my manager to call his agent
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#139:1:B> And uh his agent gave us <}> <-> his </-> <=> his </=> </}> home

number
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#140:1:B> I called him and I said <,> it was me and I said would you like to

do a tap solo
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#141:1:B> And he said send me a tape
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#142:1:B> I sent him a tape
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#143:1:B> He called me the next day and said you bet <O> laugh </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#144:1:A> All right

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#145:1:B> And so we uh
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#146:1:B> I went to L A cos he was going to be in L A in a few weeks <,,>

from that time
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#147:1:B> And uh <}> <-> we </-> <=> Joe and I </=> </}> built him <}> <-> a

</-> uh <=> a </=> </}> stage
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#148:1:B> Two four by eight plywoods nailed together on two by fours
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#149:1:B> Threw a little sand on it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#150:1:B> Put a couple of mics <&> microphones </&> and said <quote> go

Gregory </quote> <O> laugh </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#151:1:A> <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#152:1:A> Must have been fun to watch

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#153:1:B> It was
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#154:1:B> <}> <-> We had </-> <=> We filmed </=> </}> it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#155:1:B> It was fun

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#156:1:A> Well thanks a lot for coming in
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#157:1:A> Welcome home back home and uh
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#158:1:A> Looking forward to seeing you uh at the jazz festival

<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#160:2:A> Well for the past few summers Montrealers have been strapping

on the wheels <,> and taking off to the nearest bike path or park <,>

rollerblading
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#161:2:A> In-line skating if you like
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#162:2:A> It's getting more and more popular every year
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#163:2:A> As you probably heard last week the city of Montreal loosened its

rules just a little
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#164:2:A> Blades are now allowed on bike paths and in some parks
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#165:2:A> Today we're going to talk about safety etiquette and of course <,>

paramount we're going to talk about fun
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#166:2:A> <@> Ben </@> uh <@> Feinstein </@> is a blader
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#167:2:A> He also owns a store that sells rollerblades <,> and he joins me

in the studio now
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#168:2:A> Hi
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#169:2:A> Welcome to the program

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#170:2:B> Thanks

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#171:2:A> It's also changed the sound <,> of street hockey <,> too

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#172:2:B> <{> <[> Massively yes </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#173:2:A> <[> Yeah irreparably </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#174:2:A> Because <}> <-> my </-> <=> my </=> </}> uh sound of street

hockey is the sound of boots or running shoes clapping against the sidewalk
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#175:2:A> Now of course it's the sound of

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#176:2:B> <{> <[> Sound of bearings that need greasing </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#177:2:A> <[> Yeah yeah exactly </[> </{> <O> laugh </O>

<-> they are playing </-> <=> they are playing </=> </}> on rollerblades

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#179:2:B> Yeah I'm doing the same thing
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#180:2:B> I've got a bunch of friends who uh all converted the same way
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#181:2:B> We play in a local school yard

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#182:2:A> Oh do <}> <-> ya </-> <+> you </+> </}>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#184:2:B> <[> Yup </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#185:2:B> And uh there's the sound of scraping knees too occasionally

<,> and the occasional yelp but that's about it

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#186:2:A> Are shin guards essential

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#187:2:B> Uh not essential
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#188:2:B> It depends how you're playing
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#189:2:B> It's the same thing with shinny when you're playing hockey in

winter

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#190:2:A> Yeah you're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </-> </}> get

<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#193:2:A> I'm sure it's not just me who's noticing this but it seems to be a

quantum leap in the number of people <}> <-> roller </-> <=> roller blading

</=> </}> each year
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#194:2:A> I was out at the old port and my gosh they're everywhere

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#195:2:B> Yup
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#196:2:B> It's seems like in Montreal over the past couple of years it's

almost doubled
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#197:2:B> <}> <-> The </-> <=> The </=> </}> sales year to year have been

twice as great as they were the year before

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#198:2:A> That much eh

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#199:2:B> So yeah even last summer you're looking at a thirty percent

increase in the number of people on the streets who are blading and they're

anticipating the same thing if not more <,> for this summer so

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#200:2:A> Holy mackerel

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#201:2:B> Yeah

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#202:2:A> <}> <-> And how <.> qui </.> </-> <=> What are the age groups

</=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#203:2:A> I mean uh <}> <-> I'm </-> <=> I'm </=> </}> seeing uh uh uh
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#204:2:A> Actually I'm seeing all ages

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#205:2:B> Yeah

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#206:2:A> Is there an age group where <}> <-> it's </-> <=> it's </=>

</}> most popular

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#207:2:B> Well our store tends to uh focus on the freestyle aspect
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#208:2:B> We've got a lot of teenagers who come into our store for

snowboards and stuff

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#209:2:A> Uhm hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#210:2:B> And our focus uh actually has gone a lot broader because the

sport hits everyone
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#211:2:B> I've got my daughter on blades myself <{> <[> and </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#212:2:A> <[> How old is she </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#213:2:B> She's uh four years old <{> <[> and I </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#214:2:A> <[> How do you get blades that small </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#215:2:A> Can you

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#216:2:B> They've got <}> <-> em </-> <+> them </+> </}> they got <}>

<-> em </-> <+> them </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#217:2:B> They come with two sizes uh two size booties for the insides
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#218:2:B> They'll last longer stuff like that
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#219:2:B> And my father actually <,> is the person I've longest known to be

a blader <,> or uh in-line skater and he's been doing it for at least fifteen

years now
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#220:2:B> <{> <[> Something like that </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#221:2:A> <[> Really </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#222:2:B> He bought his blades way back in the seventies
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#223:2:B> Seventy-eight <{> <[> seventy-nine </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#224:2:A> <[> Well I'm not <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> be

</[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#225:2:A> <}> <-> That is a long </-> <=> He's a real pioneer isn't he

</=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#226:2:A> I'm not <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> be indelicate

and ask how old he is but uh needless to say uh <{> <[> he's not a kid </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#227:2:B> <[> <}> <-> He's a </-> </[> </{> <=> He's a </=> </}> <,>

<?> <}> <-> sex </-> <=> sexagenarian </=> </}> </?> or something like that
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#228:2:B> I don't know what <O> laugh </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#229:2:A> He's been around for a few decades

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#230:2:B> Yeah

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#231:2:A> What does he love so much about it

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#232:2:B> Uh I think he likes the exercise the smoothness of it the

less impact uh related problems <{> <[> the knees and back than running </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#233:2:A> <[> Than running <,> yeah uhm hmm </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#234:2:B> And you go faster
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#235:2:B> It's just the thrill of a little bit of speed without you know
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#236:2:B> Unlike a bike you don't need miles and miles to go
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#237:2:B> A couple of miles and you get a good workout <,> but you get the

sensation of going a little bit faster than <{> <[> you are </[> <}> <-> with

your </-> <=> when you're </=> </}> walking

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#238:2:A> <[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#239:2:B> And the whole feeling really <,> the essence of it that <}>

<-> I </-> <=> it </=> </}> struck me last summer was the idea of being able

to
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#240:2:B> Imagine this is like to me a Quebec dream
<ICE-CAN:S1B-044#241:2:B> The streets freeze <,> but it's warm and you can use your skates

all summer long and go anywhere and

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#242:2:A> So they are they really are a natural extension of us

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#243:2:B> <{> <[> Oh yeah </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-044#244:2:A> <[> Aren't they yeah </[> </{> </I>
