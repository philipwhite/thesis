<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#2:1> <bold> By Lennard Sillanpaa </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#3:1> During the early morning of 12 November 1838, Nils Gustaf von

Schoultz crossed into Upper Canada at the head of a 190-man American invasion

force.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#4:1> His objectives were liberty, the expul <l> sion of British <quote> "

tyranny" </quote> from North America, and the establishment of a domestic

republican form of government for Canadians. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#5:1> Their landing at a place called Windmill Point, located two

kilometres east of the community of Pres <l> cott on the upper St. Lawrence

River, was to be the launching of a <quote> " bloodless liberation" </quote>

of Upper Canada sponsored by an American group called the <w> Hunters' </w>

Society of Onondaga County, New York.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#6:1> In the ensu <l> ing five days of fighting between Americans and

Canadians, 37 men died and 89 were wounded.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#7:1> This attempted American invasion was an episode in the rebellions of

1837-38. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#8:1> Less than one month later on 8 December Nils von Schoultz was

hanged and buried at Fort Henry in Kingston.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#9:1> Like others before him and since, von Schoultz came to learn that

Canadians are different from their American neighbours.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#10:1> On the night before his execution, in a final letter to a friend, he

wrote: <l> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#X11:1> <quote> Let no further blood be shed; and believe me, from what I

have seen, that all the stories that were told about the sufferings of the

Canadian people were untrue. </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#12:1> Nils von Schoultz was a tragic figure whose brief appearance on

the stage of Canadian history helped shape the development of this emerging

nation.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#13:1> In the days between his capture and execution, he also came to have a

significant impact on the political develop <l> ment of a future Canadian

prime minister. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#14:1> Nils Gustaf von Schoultz was born on 7 October 1807 in Kuopio,

Finland, the second son of a circuit court judge.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#15:1> In 1808, during the Napoleonic wars, Russian troops crossed the

Finnish frontier and his family fled to Sweden. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#16:1> After the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1808 many officials and

refugees returned to Finland, but von Schoultz's parents chose to remain in

Sweden. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#17:1> In 1821, the young Nils von Schoultz qualified for the Royal

Military Academy in Stockholm where an older brother was already following a

military career.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#18:1> By December 1823, von Schoultz was promoted to second lieutenant in

the Svea Regiment of Artillery.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#19:1> In November 1830, he received an honourable dis <l> charge from the

military. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#20:1> In early 1831 stories from Poland reached Sweden that told of

czarist repression and of fierce resistance by students and cadets in Warsaw.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#21:1> Many Swedes decided to assist the Poles against their Russian mas <l>

ters.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#22:1> One of these was von Schoultz who left for Poland in secrecy in 1831

and plunged headlong into the defence of Warsaw. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#23:1> Von Schoultz later made his way to France where he joined the

Foreign Legion in North Africa, moving on, in March of 1833, to join his

family in Florence where his sister was studying music. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#24:1> A year later he married Ann Cordelia Campbell in the English

church at Florence.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#25:1> His wife was a member of a well-established Scottish merchant family

from Edinburgh.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#26:1> The couple settled in Karlskrona, Sweden, where both their daughters

were born. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#27:1> Von Schoultz tried to settle down to a normal family life as a

businessman-inventor but does not seem to have been successful.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#28:1> In June 1836, he visited London on business.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#29:1> His family remained in Sweden.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#30:1> A month later, without telling anyone, he left for the United States.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#31:1> While he officially gave his nationality as Swedish, von Schoultz

began passing himself off as a Pole.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#32:1> He was known to everyone as a former officer in the Polish Army who

had been forced to leave his homeland by Russian oppressors. </p> <O> picture

</O> <O> Americans line the river bank at Ogdensburg, New York, to watch the

battle at Windmill Point. The British steamers " Victoria" and " Cobourg" are

seen arriving from Kingston with troops aboard. </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#33:1> Von Schoultz became interested in the salt industry developing

around the upstate New York towns of Syr <l> acuse and Salina ( Salina later

merged to become part of Syracuse).
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#34:1> He came to have many friends in Salina, which was located near the

Canadian border. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#35:1> In December 1837 authorities in Upper Canada put down an

attempted rebellion.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#36:1> Many of the leaders of this uprising fled to the United States where

they found sympathetic support for their proposals to liberate Canada from

the oppression of British colonial rule. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#37:1> Throughout 1838, a number of forces operating out of the United

States conducted a series of raids and acts of piracy along the Canadian

border.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#38:1> Newspapers, local government officials and merchants in the border

states led the campaign to <quote> " liberate" </quote> Canada.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#39:1> Officials in Washington, under the administration of President Martin

van Buren, however, were more cautious, so these liberation enthusiasts had

to operate under the cloak of secrecy. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#40:1> One organization that sprang to life in 1838 was the Patriot

Hunters which formed hundreds of <quote> " <w> Hunt <l> ers' </w> Lodges"

</quote> throughout the border states, recruited some 40,000 members and

raised tens of thousands of dollars for the purchase of arms. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#41:1> The <w> Hunters' </w> Lodge of Salina recruited von Schoultz to

their cause.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#42:1> Von Schoultz, for his part, eagerly accepted the role of liberating

Canada from what he believed to be the oppression of Britain. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#43:1> One of the leading Hunters in New York state, John Ward Birge,

devised a plan to capture the British gar <l> rison of Fort Wellington

located in Prescott.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#44:1> Directly opposite Prescott was Ogdensburg, New York, which was a

hotbed of Hunter sympathizers.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#45:1> Birge believed that the seizing of Fort Wellington, one of the main

British garrisons along the Canadian-American bor <l> der, would prompt

dissatisfied Canadians to rise up in revolt. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#46:1> Birge began recruiting a force of some 300 men, arms and

ammunition, cannon, and vessels for this attack.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#47:1> One of those he recruited was the recently arrived Nils von Schoultz.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#48:1> Through the summer and fall of 1838, the Govern <l> ment of Upper

Canada heard reports from informants living in the United States regarding

the growth of popular American sentiment in favour of invading Canada and of

the buildup of men, money and weap <l> ons in American communities along the

border.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#49:1> The government began to re-build Fort Wellington, and to establish a

number of militia units in communities near the American border. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#50:1> During the night of Sunday, 11 November an Amer <l> ican steamer

towing two schooners entered Canadian waters.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#51:1> The private invasion force assembled by Birge - who had given himself

the grandiose military title of <quote> " Major-General" </quote> - was

aboard these vessels. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#52:1> Near Prescott, the lines to the two schooners were cut.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#53:1> An attempt at a surprise docking at the wharf in Prescott was sighted

by residents who raised the alarm.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#54:1> The two schooners retreated into the waters of the river and then

separated. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#55:1> At this point, the invasion of Canada by the Hunters became a

combination of organizational chaos and low farce.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#56:1> The larger of the two schooners grounded on a sandbar in American

waters.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#57:1> The smaller one, which had von Schoultz on board, landed on the

Canadian side of the river at Windmill Point and began unload <l> ing its men

and equipment. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#58:1> Low farce occurred when <quote> " Major-General" </quote> Birge

suddenly developed what he claimed was a stomach disorder and abruptly

retired from the scene.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#59:1> Others also decided to remain in Ogdensburg.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#60:1> More than one hundred insurgents never made it to the Canadian side.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#61:1> Later that Monday, officials of the United States Navy arrived in

Ogdensburg and prevented any more attempts by American vessels to cross.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#62:1> By Tuesday, there was little communication between Ogdensburg and

Windmill Point. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#63:1> When the insurgents at Windmill Point realized that Birge would

not be joining them, von Schoultz was chosen as commander. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#64:1> The American insurgents might have been more successful despite

their appalling lack of preparation.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#65:1> While the landing at Windmill Point was totally unplanned, the

insurgents were fortunate to find a massive stone windmill some 20 metres

high sur <l> rounded by several stone buildings.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#66:1> From the top of the mill one could easily reconnoitre the surrounding

area for enemy troop movements.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#67:1> For an experienced military commander such as Nils von Schoultz, Wind

<l> mill Point could have served as a perfect site for establishing a

beachhead on enemy territory until rein <l> forcements arrived. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#68:1> The British and Canadians quickly collected a large force of

regular soldiers and militia numbering nearly 2,000 men.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#69:1> On Tuesday morning of that week the two sides engaged in a fierce

rifle and musket battle.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#70:1> Find <l> ing the insurgents too strongly entrenched, the Canadians

retreated to await the arrival of their heavy artillery. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#71:1> As the week progressed, the situation for the insur <l> gents

became increasingly hopeless.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#72:1> The Canadians had not risen in rebellion against their colonial gov

<l> ernment.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#73:1> In fact, the very opposite was happening as hundreds joined their

local militias to repulse this inva <l> sion.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#74:1> Some of the Americans either escaped to the United States or were

captured while trying to leave.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#75:1> Many suffered from wounds incurred in the Tuesday battle.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#76:1> The weather turned very cold. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#77:1> Although the insurgents held their position for five days, no

reinforcements came.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#78:1> What was particularly frustrating for the hard-pressed American

invading party throughout the week was to look across the river and see

thousands of Americans, most of whom were sympathetic to the cause of <quote>

" liberating" </quote> Canada from British rule, standing along the

shorelines watching events unfold on the Canadian side. </p> <O> picture </O>

Windmill at Prescott", 1839, by H.F. Ainslie. </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#79:1> On Friday afternoon, the British artillery began bombarding the

American positions.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#80:1> The insurgents began to either surrender or attempt to escape.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#81:1> Von Schoultz himself was captured late Friday evening as he hid in

bushes along the river bank. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#82:1> Many of the battles fought in 1838 between Amer <l> ican raiding

parties and the British/Canadian forces were little more than bloody

skirmishes lasting less than an hour.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#83:1> The American invaders lacked the dis <l> cipline of the British

regular soldiers or the determination of Canadian militia members defending

their own homes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#84:1> It is to von Schoultz's great credit as a military commander that

the rag-tag fighting unit he led ( some of whom were only 14 years old and

none of whom had any real military experience) held out for five days in a

desperate situation after sustaining heavy initial losses. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#85:1> The prisoners spent one night in Fort Wellington.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#86:1> They were then transferred by steamer to Kingston and the military

prison at Fort Henry where the gov <l> ernment held its courts-martial. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#87:1> A young Kingston lawyer, John A. Macdonald, had been retained to

give legal advice to one of the other prisoners.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#88:1> Macdonald met von Schoultz at this time and gave him some legal

advice for conducting his defence at his court-martial.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#89:1> Von Schoultz insisted on pleading guilty. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#90:1> At his court-martial, von Schoultz made a distinct impression on

the British regular soldiers and others of his Canadian captors.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#91:1> As leader of the insurgents, von Schoultz assumed all responsibility

for the tragedy at Windmill Point.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#92:1> He made no attempt to defend himself except to say he had treated his

wounded pris <l> oners well.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#93:1> He never displayed any bitterness and refrained from censuring those

who had let him down with promises of reinforcements. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#94:1> A total of eleven of the prisoners were executed.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#95:1> Sixty others were sent into exile to the penal colony of Van Dieman's

Land ( present-day Tasmania). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#96:1> The first of the insurgents to hang was Nils von Schoultz.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#97:1> As a mark of respect for his military back <l> ground, von Schoultz

was the only one of the eleven to be hanged and buried at Fort Henry. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#98:1> Throughout the time of his capture until his exe <l> cution, von

Schoultz maintained his posture of being a former Polish officer.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#99:1> It was perhaps essential that he continued to do so.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#100:1> The fact that von Schoultz had a Scottish wife and that he had

abandoned her and their children would hardly have improved his situa <l>

tion.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#101:1> It would probably have dissipated the respect he had been able to

create among his captors as an hon <l> ourable, albeit misguided, lover of

liberty. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#102:1> For more than 130 years, Canadian and American historians

regarded von Schoultz as the former Polish army officer he had portrayed

himself to be. <O> picture </O> <O> A company of the 93rd ( Highland) Foot

was sent from Montreal to help repel the Americans in Upper Canada. </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#103:1> It was not until 1971, when Ella Pipping, von Schoultz's

great-granddaughter, published a biography on her ancestor that historians

learned that von Schoultz was actually a Finn by birth, a Swedish national

and that, in fact, this " Polish" freedom-fighter had only spent some six

months in Poland. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-003#104:1> Macdonald drew up von Schoultz's will.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#105:1> Money was left to the Roman Catholic college in Kingston and to

families of the Canadian militiamen killed at the Windmill.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#106:1> He wrote a last letter to friends in Salina.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-003#107:1> There was, however, no last letter to his family in Sweden. </p>
