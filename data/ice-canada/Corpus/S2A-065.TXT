<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-065#1:2:A> That's how she got out there
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#2:2:A> That's her best chance of getting back
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#3:2:A> And <,> even though she didn't want to at that point I'd suggest

that <,,> probably at that point <,> though she didn't <}> <-> wanna </-> <+>

want to </+> </}> go through with what she'd agreed to go through with it's

because she <?> 's </?> got nervous with these men that <,> she probably

thought her best way out of there was to uhm <,> go through with the uh

prostitution agreement <,> get out of there <,> and hopefully nothing would

happen <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#4:2:A> But then when Mr <@> LePieu </@> bailed out she gets <,> <?> lost

</?> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#5:2:A> At that point <,> <}> <-> I suggest that </-> <,> it's a matter for

you to decide but <=> I suggest that </=> </}> <,> <@> Paddy Warbucks </@>

didn't have a chance to leave at that point
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#6:2:A> Very definitely wanted to leave at that point
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#7:2:A> <,> And from that point on I suggest we have someone that has <&>

could be 'is' </&> <,> been <,> mislead about where they were taking them <,>

that was unlawfully confined from the point at which they took her beyond <,>

<@> Toony Road </@> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#8:2:A> That once she was at that house <,> that she was effectively

unlawfully confined
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#9:2:A> She was assaulted
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#10:2:A> She was dragged by the hair <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#11:2:A> And ultimately <,> raped <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#12:2:A> And <,> ultimately defended herself <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#13:2:A> That's what the defence suggests was the scenario
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#14:2:A> Sure <,> she agreed that <,> she would uh be involved in

prostitution with these men
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#15:2:A> She didn't agree <,> to being abused
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#16:2:A> She didn't agree to go to <@> Toony </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#17:2:A> Once the agreement was breached <,> there was no longer <unclear>

three or four words </unclear> with them
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#18:2:A> And <,> I suggest that <,> the fact that she took two hundred

dollars <,> at that point <,> she was probably looking I suggest at what's

the best way out of this <,> problem
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#19:2:A> First I take the money <,> and so <,> the other way would be <,>

<?> I'll take the money </?> <unclear> two or three words </unclear> walk
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#20:2:A> <?> I'll take it back to </?> <unclear> name </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#21:2:A> But the next <unclear> word </unclear> that holds clear that uh <,>

hour and a half of <,> uh <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#22:2:A> She hadn't agreed times two hundred dollars worth of abuse
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#23:2:A> She didn't agree <,> she didn't <?> laugh </?> around <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#24:2:A> She agreed <,> to have sex for money <,> and that's all she agreed

to
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#25:2:A> And <,> the one thing that I could <,> see <,> going through one of

your minds <,> or perhaps through my learned friend's mind <,> is <,> well

<,> why did she hit him more than two to three times <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#26:2:A> Well <,> in that vein <,> if one pictures <,> the fact that this

man was so much larger than her <unclear> word </unclear> much stronger than

her <,,> and her rather <,> isolated feeling out there <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#27:2:A> The last thing that you want <,> is an enraged <,> violent mean

person <,> that you just hurt <,> by hitting him with a hammer <?> him <?>

taking off <?> and </?> <,> coming after you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#28:2:A> Uhm <,> I suggest that once she decided that her life was in danger

<,> she had no alternative <,> in her mind except <,> put the guy down so he

<?> 'd </?> stay down
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#29:2:A> Whether she knew for sure that he would die <,> she certainly

intended I suggest <,> to hurt him to a great <,> great <unclear> word

</unclear> </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#30:2:A> We <unclear> two or three words </unclear> <?> with that </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#31:2:A> And <,> she felt it was necessary according to her testimony <,>

and she did it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#32:2:A> And <,> unless you can be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that

that position <,> is not true <,> that's the end of the matter
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#33:2:A> <?> That </?> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#34:2:A> <?> If there's </?> even a possiblity that that's correct <,> uhm

she's entitled to be found not guilty
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#35:2:A> <,> <}> <-> The uhm </-> <,> <=> On that </=> </}> <,> you and the

court have to determine her credibility <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#36:2:A> She was <,> on the witness stand <,> longer than perhaps any other

witness <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#37:2:A> And uh <,,> <}> <-> s' </-> <+> it's </+> </}> very hard for us to

put ourselves in the place <}> <-> of </-> <=> of </=> </}> someone else and

say is she reacting <,> as a truthful witness would <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#38:2:A> And <,> did she react the way a reasonable person would react <?>

out of </?> <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#39:2:A> You can't put yourself into that position
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#40:2:A> It's very very difficult <}> <-> to </-> <,> <=> <?> that is </?>

to </=> </}> see the world through someone else's eyes
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#41:2:A> <?> Or <?> <,> what would be reasonable force <?> for someone else

</?> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#42:2:A> How terrified would you be <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#43:2:A> I don't remember the last time I was <,> terrified
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#44:2:A> I remember being frightened for a split second <unclear> word

</unclear> <,> or startled <,> but I don't remember the last time that I was

terrified <,> for <,> half and hour <,> forty-five minutes
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#45:2:A> <unclear> word </unclear> can you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#46:2:A> Can you <,> picture a time when you were <,> terrified for that

long <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#47:2:A> And so <,> unless you can <?> I suggest you'll </?> <,> great great

deal of difficulty <,> imagining what was going through <@> Paddy Warbucks

</@> 's mind as her fear built and built and built <,> when she was abandoned

<,> by Mr <@> LePieu </@> <,> with this mean violent man <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#48:2:A> Likewise <,> when she's <&> could be very fast 'she wez' </&> up

here on the witness stand trying to recreate that scene <,> and trying to <,>

paint that picture for you people <,,> very difficult
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#49:2:A> I suggest <,> she made an admirable <,> job of it and <,> I suggest

that her testimony was truthful <?> and honest </?> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#50:2:A> There are things <,> that I suggest <,> as a lawyer that <,> I

<unclear> word </unclear> noticed <?> and </?> I'm <}> <-> gonna </-> <+>

going to </+> </}> point out to you but <,> ultimately you'll have to be the

judge of whether you thought she was telling the truth but <,> little things

like <,,> she was asked about whether she borrowed money <,> thirty dollars

from uh <@> Anna Swinton </@> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#51:2:A> She said no <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#52:2:A> And <unclear> word </unclear> <@> Anna Swinton </@> yeah I owe her

thirty dollars
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#53:2:A> Well why was that <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#54:2:A> Well <}> <-> I </-> <=> she </=> </}> <,> came in here and <?> sold

me </?> <unclear> rest of utterance </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#55:2:A> <?> And </?> <,> that doesn't make her look bad
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#56:2:A> I mean she <,> didn't have to tell you that <,> but she did <&>

tape cuts out </&> </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-065#57:3:A> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury it is now my responsibility

to direct you with respect to the law <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#58:3:A> And as I mentioned earlier <?> as to </?> the law you must accept

<,> <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#59:3:A> But equally <,> definite is your role in judgment <,> of the facts

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#60:3:A> You and you alone have the responsibility <,> in fact the sole

responsibility <,> for determining <,> what <,> are the facts in this case
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#61:3:A> <,> Both counsels for the accused <,> and <unclear> word </unclear>

Crown counsel <,> have reviewed the facts at some length <,> and that is

their responsibility and duty as counsel <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#62:3:A> But what they have said about the facts <,> based <,> on the

evidence can either be accepted by you <,> or rejected by you <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#63:3:A> It is for you alone <,> to make that determination <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#64:3:A> Now for the purpose of assisting you <,> I'm going to go over some

of the evidence as I recollect it <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#65:3:A> But if you disagree with my recollection <,> of the evidence <,> it

is the way that you recollect the evidence <,> and not the way <,> that I

recollect it <,> that is important <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#66:3:A> Because I have said previously you are the sole <,> judge of the

facts <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#67:3:A> Now nothing <,> and I underline that nothing has been proven in

this case <,> until you the members of the jury <,> make a determination that

it has <,> been proven <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#68:3:A> As I go through the evidence I may say that this has been proven

<,> or that has been proven <,> or draw your attention to a certain piece of

evidence which I think is <unclear> two or three words </unclear> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#69:3:A> Or I may say that this is a fact or that is a fact
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#70:3:A> But unless I say to you categorically that this is a matter of law

<,> that I speak <,> then I'm <?> not incorrect </?> in stating that anything

has been established <,> because nothing has been established until you the

members of the jury <,> have made that decision <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#71:3:A> I may suggest to you that certain inferences and conclusions can be

drawn from the facts <,> so that you will have little difficulty in arriving

at a certain conclusion
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#72:3:A> And I'll be doing that later when I go over the case <?> in </?>

some detail <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#73:3:A> But in the end it is up for you and you alone as to whether any

inference should be drawn <,> or any conclusion should be drawn or if a

fact's proven <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#74:3:A> And you are only to consider the evidence that was presented to you

<,> from the witness box <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> nothing else <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#75:3:A> You are not to consider anything that you may have heard outside

the courtroom <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#76:3:A> The decision on which evidence you accept as credible <,> or worthy

of belief is entirely for you to make <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#77:3:A> And this case <,> <?> that's on the stand </?> <,> is a matter <,>

of determining <,> credibility
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#78:3:A> It is for you to decide which witnesses and which evidence you

accept and which evidence you reject <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#79:3:A> You may accept a portion of the evidence as I stated in my opening

<,> given by a witness or you may reject it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#80:3:A> You may accept parts of it or <}> <-> you <.> e </.> <.> ma </.>

</-> <=> you may </=> </}> reject parts of it <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#81:3:A> Or you may reject all of the evidence <unclear> two or three words

</unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#82:3:A> Now an honest witness can sometimes be mistaken <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#83:3:A> And when a number of different people observe a particular event

<,> and that is especially so when there is <?> a <?> stress <?> involved

</?> <,> people sometimes see things <,> differently <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#84:3:A> <?> But then </?> differences in evidence may indicate to you <,>

that the witnesses did not get together and manufacture or rehearse the story
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#85:3:A> You may consider that a healthy sign or in the alternative you may

decide <,> that a witness or witnesses are deliberately <,> trying <,> to

deceive
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#86:3:A> That's for you to say <,> if this honest witness may be telling the

truth in some part of his or her evidence <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#87:3:A> You are also entitled to make reasonable deductions <,> and draw

reasonable inferences and conclusions from the facts <,> which you accept out

of the evidence <,> given in this trial <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#88:3:A> I must also emphasize <,> the position <,> of an expert <,> witness

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#89:3:A> And we did have one expert that was involved in this case Dr <@>

Seuss </@> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#90:3:A> An expert is a witness who by reason of special <,> skill <,> and

training is able to give opinion <?> evidence </?> within his or her <,>

field <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#91:3:A> An expert witness who gives his or her opinion <,> is no different

<,> from any other witness <,,> as far as your right to accept or reject all

or part of the evidence <,> is concerned
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#92:3:A> You can accept the opinion of the expert <,,> but if in your

opinion the facts indicate a different result <,> you are to <,> take your

opinion <,> and reject the expert <?> opinion </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#93:3:A> And if on any matter the expert is wrong in your view <,> if you

draw a different conclusion <,> <}> <-> than that of the <.> exp </.> </->

<=> than that of the expert </=> </}> <,> you have the absolute <,> right <,>

to do so
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#94:3:A> <?> That's the jury's </?> responsibility
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#95:3:A> You are here because you are presumed to be <?> calm </?> <,>

reasonable and <,> inclement <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#96:3:A> And this is a case where you should exercise your good

old-fashioned common sense <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#97:3:A> You are entitled to draw from your experiences in life and your

associations in life <,> your knowledge of life and that of your fellow <,>

citizens
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#98:3:A> So what I'm saying is just apply some <}> <-> good old- <.> common

</.> - fashioned <,> fashioned </-> <=> good old-fashioned common sense </=>

</}> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#99:3:A> It's so important <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#100:3:A> <unclear> utterance </unclear> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#101:3:A> Now as mentioned by counsel <,> this is a very very <,> important

<}> <-> <.> corner </.> <&> pronounced coroner </&> </-> <=> cornerstone </=>

</}> in our democracy <?> and </?> Canadian law <,> that the accused in this

case we have three of them <,> come into this court <,> as innocent men <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#102:3:A> The law presumes them to be innocent <,> as to these charges sorry

<?> I suppose </?> that should be this charge <,> I'm sorry there's only one

charge <,> until the charge has been proven by the Crown <,> beyond a

reasonable doubt <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#103:3:A> Now under our legal system there is absolutely no obligation on

the accused <,> to prove their innocence <&> could be 'they're innocent' - -

voice lowers </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#104:3:A> They don't have to prove anything <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#105:3:A> And <}> <-> there's no <.> ob </.> </-> they did testify in this

case but <=> there's no obligation </=> </}> whatsoever <,> for them <}> <->

to to </-> <=> to </=> </}> go on the stand and tell their stories <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#106:3:A> The Crown must prove each and every ingredient of the offence <,>

necessary to sustain the charge <,> beyond a reasonable doubt <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#107:3:A> And that burden <,> through the trial <,> never shifts
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#108:3:A> It's on the Crown at the start of the trial <,> throughout the

trial <,> and it's on the Crown right now <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#109:3:A> And I said before the Crown must establish the guilt of the

accused to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#110:3:A> And those are <,> critical words in this case
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#111:3:A> Counsel <unclear> four or five words </unclear> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#112:3:A> And in most criminal cases that is the most important aspect <,>

of the case
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#113:3:A> I'm going to repeat that phrase <,> over and over again in my

charge <,> and <}> <-> if <.> sh </.> </-> <=> I should </=> </}> say <,> to

question <,> what is a reasonable doubt
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#115:3:A> What do those words mean <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-065#116:3:A> The words reasonable and the word doubt <,> they're ordinary words
