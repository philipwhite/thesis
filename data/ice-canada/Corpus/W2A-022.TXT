<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#4:1> Across the northern half of North America, there are two natural

regions - the Arctic and the Subarctic.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#5:1> Climate has played a key role in forming these two biomes.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#6:1> The arctic climate, for instance, is associated with a particular type

of natural vegetation, soils, and biological life.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#7:1> All these natural features are interrelated.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#8:1> Their natural vegetation provides the most visible spatial pattern (

Figure 2.1).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#9:1> These same natural regions form the cultural homelands of the Inuit

and Indian peoples. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#10:1> The common denominator found in both regions, but particularly in

the Arctic, is the presence of a cold environment, which results in slow

growth of biological life, natural vegetation, and soil formation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#11:1> Because of the polar climate, the presence of permafrost, cold ocean

bodies, and the chilling effect of the Labrador current, only the continental

areas of the Subarctic experience warm weather for any length of time.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#12:1> Besides being a cold environment, most of the North receives so

little precipitation that it is termed a cold desert.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#13:1> These two factors, low temperatures and low precipitation, make the

North among the least productive biological areas of the world ( Figure 2.2).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#14:1> At the same time, such a slow rate of plant and biological life means

that the natural environment is slow to recover from natural or anthropogenic

damage.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#15:1> The fragile nature of the polar environments is indicated by the

relationship of temperature and precipitation to plant growth ( Figure 2.2)

<O> Figure 2.1 </O> <O> Figure 2.1 Caption </O> <O> Figure 2.2 </O> <O>

Figure 2.2 Caption </O> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#16:1> The Arctic has the coldest environment in Canada.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#17:1> It lies north of the treeline, found primarily in the Northwest

Territories but also in Quebec, Newfoundland, Ontario, Yukon, and Manitoba.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#18:1> It is characterized by a very cold climate where the warmest month

has a mean monthly tempera <l> ture of less than 10&degree;C.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#19:1> Under such climatic conditions, normal tree growth is not possible

and a tundra vegetation is formed.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#20:1> True zonal soils are not found in the Arctic.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#21:1> In many places, rock and unconsolidated gravels and sands form the

ground surface.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#22:1> Where thin soils have formed in the continuous permafrost zone, they

are often classified as cryosols ( soils which have an active or thawed layer

of less than one metre in depth).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#23:1> Under these conditions, soil-forming processes work extremely slowly

because soil temperatures are often just above the freezing point.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#24:1> Even when summer air temperatures thaw the top few centimetres of the

ground, the presence of permafrost beneath this thin active layer acts not

only as a cooling agent but also as a barrier to water. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#25:1> Arctic vegetation is often divided into two zones - Low Arctic

and High Arctic.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#26:1> The Low Arctic occupies the mainland while the High Arctic is found

in parts of Keewatin and the Arctic Archipelago.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#27:1> The Low Arctic zone is characterized by nearly complete plant cover,

including many shrubs, sedges, and scrub trees such as birch and willow.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#28:1> Tussock sedge and low tundra shrubs are the summer grazing of barren

ground caribou, which are still a major source of food for Native people.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#29:1> Heath, herbs, and lichen are the typical plants.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#30:1> While trees such as willows do grow, they reach a height of only a

few centimetres. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#31:1> In the High Arctic zone, freezing temperatures occur almost daily

and permafrost is present near the surface throughout the year so that even

tundra vegetation growth is inhibited.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#32:1> Periglacial features - bare rock and a variety of unconsolidated

materials - are commonly found.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#33:1> Such barren arctic lowlands are called polar deserts ( Vignette 2.1).

</p> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X34:1> <h> <bold> Vignette 2.1 Polar Desert </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X35:1> The term <quote> 'polar desert' </quote> usually describes

barren areas of bare rock, shattered bedrock, and sterile gravel.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X36:1> These conditions are essentially an extreme form of fell field, with

vegetation cover, at least of higher plants, reduced to near zero.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X37:1> Actually, this initial impression of barrenness is usually

inaccurate.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X38:1> It is hard to find a square metre of polar desert that has no form

of vegetation growing on it.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X39:1> By far the most important group of plants here are the lichens. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X40:1> Lichens ( pronounced like <it> ' - unz </it> ) are the foot

soldiers or unsung heroes of the tundra environment.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X41:1> Lichens are in a sense a group of primitive plants, although it is

more correct to think of them as a colony or association of two kinds of

plants living together.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X42:1> The main body of a lichen is called a thallus; it consists of a

dense, tangled mass of threadlike fungal material.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X43:1> This fungal matrix varies greatly in shape from one kind of lichen

to another, but each kind has a characteristic form by which it can usually

be identified.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X44:1> Encapsulated with the fungal strands are quantities of single-celled

algae.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X45:1> These tiny green plants supply the colony with nutrients. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X46:1> SOURCE Young 1989: 198. </p> </X>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#47:1> The treeline often serves as the boundary between the Arctic and

the Subarctic.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#48:1> Ecologically, the treeline represents a major <quote> ` break'

</quote> between the two regions, though in fact the <quote> 'break' </quote>

is a gradual one consisting of a wooded tundra ( Vignette 2.2). <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X49:1> <h> <bold> Vignette 2.2 The Treeline </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X50:1> The treeline represents a dividing zone between the Arctic and

Subarctic regions.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X51:1> It closely corresponds to the 10&degree;C monthly mean temperature

for July.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X52:1> Other natural factors, such as the depth of the active layer of

permafrost, protection from wind, south slope radiation, and well drained

land, may result in patches of trees growing north of this isotherm, or

conversely, tundra occurring south of it.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X53:1> Then too, weather varies from year to year, causing the annual

position of the isotherm to fluctuate somewhat.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X54:1> During the relatively warm decade of the 1980s, for instance, summer

temperatures were much higher in high latitudes than in most previous

decades.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X55:1> All of these factors have produced a transition zone of wooded

tundra between the Arctic and Subarctic regions. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X56:1> Three centres close to this imaginary line are Aklavik (

68&degree;12'N), Churchill ( 58&degree;48'N), and Cartwright (

53&degree;36'N).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X57:1> Aklavik, located on a deltaic island at the mouth of the Mackenzie

River, has a warmest-month average mean temperature of 14&degree;C;

Churchill, situated near the shore of Hudson Bay, has an average July

temperature of 11.8&degree;C; and Cartwright, lying along the Labrador Coast,

has a mean July figure of 12&degree;.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X58:1> About 250 km inland from the coast, temperatures are much higher

and, at Happy Valley-Goose Bay, the mean July temperature is 15.8&degree;.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#X59:1> The continental effect of this large land mass coupled with the

summer cooling caused by the ocean waters of Hudson Bay have resulted in a

north-west to south-east trend to the 'treeline'. </p> </X>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#60:1> The proportion of tundra to forest varies but, toward the Arctic

zone, only a few stunted trees are found in the more protected areas of river

valleys.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#61:1> Spruce and larch are the predomi <l> nant species found in the wooded

tundra.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#62:1> This transition zone also repre <l> sents a biological and cultural

boundary.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#63:1> Many subarctic animals, including the beaver and moose, are not found

in the Arctic and of the aboriginal peoples only the Inuit developed the

technology permitting year-round life in the Arctic. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#64:1> The Subarctic, the largest natural region in North America, is

covered by the boreal forest in a continuous belt from Newfoundland to the

Rocky Mountains.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#65:1> Its summers are short but warm, allowing for a much richer vegetation

cover than that found in the Arctic.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#66:1> Coniferous trees predomi <l> nate.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#67:1> Variation in this forest allows for the identification of four

subzones: wooded tundra, lichen woodland, closed boreal forest, and forest

park-land.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#68:1> The wooded tundra forms the transition zone beyond which lies the

tundra.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#69:1> Patches of spruce and larch are found in sheltered, low-lying areas

while high, more exposed lands are treeless.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#70:1> The lichen woodland is a savannah-like area consisting of a thick

groundcover of lichens inter <l> spersed with stands of spruce and pine.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#71:1> The closed boreal forest, a dense forest of fir, spruce, and pine, is

found in southern Yukon, a small part of the Northwest Territories (

principally the upper Mackenzie Valley), and the seven provinces.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#72:1> Within this zone, the forest cover, is broken by a variety of

wetlands including muskeg and peat bogs.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#73:1> In this wet environment, black spruce and larch are the most common

species.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#74:1> On the better drained land, species of spruce, fir, pine, and larch

are common along with stands of poplar and birch.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#75:1> Towards its southern limits, broad-leaf trees, particularly aspen and

birch, are found.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#76:1> The forest parkland, a narrow transition area adjacent to the

Canadian Prairies, is a combina <l> tion of forest and mid-latitude

grasslands.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#77:1> Small bushes, including blue <l> berries, and grasses form the floor

cover. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#78:1> Infertile podzolic soils are common in the Subarctic.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#79:1> These thin, acidic soils are best formed under cool, wet growing

conditions where the princi <l> pal vegetative litter is derived from a

coniferous forest.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#80:1> A low evaporation rate, immature drainage, and permafrost ensure an

excess of ground moisture, resulting in severely leached soils and the

widespread occur <l> rence of marsh and bogs.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#81:1> In spite of these environmental handicaps, soil formation is much

more active in the Subarctic than it is in the Arctic.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#82:1> One reason is that the longer summer temperatures allow the ground to

thaw to a depth of several metres, promoting biological activity and chemical

action.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#83:1> Another is that the vegetation cover is much denser in the Subarctic

than in the Arctic, thus providing much more plant litter for soil formation.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#84:1> Subarctic lakes and forests provide an attractive environment for

many animals and wildfowl.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#85:1> Unlike animals in the Arctic, wildlife in the Subarc <l> tic often

hibernates during the winter months.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#86:1> Within this forested biome, a wide variety of animals make their

home, including the beaver, moose, and grouse.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#87:1> The abundance of lakes, marsh, and muskeg provides a favourable

habitat for many waterfowl and big game animals such as moose which graze on

shoreline vegetation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#88:1> In the winter, caribou herds migrate from the Arctic into the

northern forest. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#89:1> <h> <bold> Polar Climate </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#90:1> The cold nature of the North has shaped the vegetation, soils,

and biologi <l> cal life found in Arctic and Subarctic.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#91:1> This cold environment - the polar climate - results primarily from

low receipts of solar energy.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#92:1> It is this limited solar energy entering the northern hemisphere

which creates the two types of polar climate: the arctic and the subarctic.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#93:1> Polar climates lie in high latitudes.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#94:1> They are characterized by low levels of solar energy and

precipitation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#95:1> On average, the earth's poles receive 40% less radiation than the

equator ( Lawford 1988: 144).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#96:1> At the Arctic Circle, solar radiation is reduced to zero for one day

and, at higher latitudes, for longer periods of times, reaching six months at

the North Pole.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#97:1> Such low levels of radiation result in continuous cooling of the land

and the build-up of masses of frigid arctic air which are associated with

daily high temperatures of - 40&degree;C or lower.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#98:1> These frigid arctic air masses often surge southwards, causing

blizzard conditions in the Canadian Prai <l> ries, subzero temperatures in

eastern Canada and freezing temperatures in the southern United States.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#99:1> In the spring, solar radiation increases but, because of the

reflective snow-cover, much of its effect is lost, with up to 80% of the

solar radiation being reflected.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#100:1> Until the snow cover melts, the breaking of winter's grip is slowed.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#101:1> Once the snow is gone, temperatures recover rapidly and the ensuing

warm weather quickly melts the ice from lakes, rivers, and the sea coast.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#102:1> By early July, sea ice has disappeared from Hudson Bay and, a few

weeks later, from along the edge of the arctic sea coast.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#103:1> Polar Pack Ice, of course, continues to occupy most of the Arctic

Ocean.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#104:1> During the short summer, massive amounts of solar radiation reach

the northern lands and waters.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#105:1> With long daylight hours, the landscape warms and plants quickly

appear and flower.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#106:1> Daily summer temperatures in the Mackenzie Valley and southern Yukon

can reach into the low 30&degree;C.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#107:1> By September, however, cooling begins and winter soon regains its

grip on the polar lands and waters. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#108:1> The seasonal pattern of air temperatures is illustrated in

Figure 2.3.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#109:1> The winter regime is shown by the mean daily temperature for

January, demonstrating its cold continental nature.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#110:1> The coldest January tempera <l> tures are found in two places - the

north end of Ellesmere and Axel Heiberg islands and just south of Boothia

Peninsula.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#111:1> On the other hand, the mean daily temperature for July demonstrates

both the warming effect of the northern land mass and the cooling effect of

the Arctic Ocean ( both open water and permanent ice pack), Hudson Bay, and

the Labrador Current.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#112:1> There is a marked northwest to southeast trend in the July isotherms

with a warm 'corridor' extending down the Mackenzie Valley. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#113:1> Precipitation in the North is generally light with the least

amount falling in the Arctic ( Figure 2.4).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#114:1> The main reasons are the inability of cold air to absorb moisture

and the existence of ice on northern lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Arctic Ocean

for much of the year.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#115:1> For these reasons, it is not surprising that the lowest annual

precipitation occurs in the ice-locked islands situated in the Arctic

Archipelago.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#116:1> Victoria Island, for example, has such scant rain and snowfall (

often less than 140 mm annually) that it is described as an 'arctic desert'.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#117:1> Resolute Bay, which is located just 16&degree; south of the North

Pole, receives less than 140 mm per year. <O> Map </O> <O> Map Caption </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#118:1> Further south, at the northern edge of the Subarctic, precipitation

is heavier.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#119:1> At Yellowknife, the annual precipitation is around 250 mm.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#120:1> The Subarctic, on the other hand, generally receives more

precipitation, usually over 300 mm annually.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#121:1> Precipitation does vary, however.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#122:1> A few areas do receive much greater precipitation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#123:1> The greatest amount of precipitation occurs in the Cordillera and

along the Atlantic coast.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#124:1> In these two areas, the high terrain results in orographic

precipitation ( rain or snow caused when warm, moisture-laden air is forced

to rise over hills or mountains and is cooled in the process).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#125:1> The south coast of Baffin Island receives around 400 mm annually

while the figures for the southern coast of Labrador and the mid-North of

Quebec exceed 800 mm.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#126:1> Most precipitation falls as snow.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#127:1> In the spring, rivers and streams are swollen by melting snow and

ice.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#128:1> Some communities along the Mackenizie River are subject to spring

flooding.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#129:1> Fort Simpson, situated on an island at the confluence of the Liard

and Mackenzie Rivers, has been inundated a number of times, and Aklavik,

located in the delta of the Mackenzie River, is threatened by spring flood

waters almost every year. <O> Map </O> <O> Map Caption </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#130:1> The occurrence of spring flooding at Aklavik is so regular that, in

the late 1950s, the federal government decided to create the new town of

Inuvik rather than expand the commu <l> nity of Aklavik. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-022#131:1> In addition to the Arctic and Subarctic climatic types, most

climatic maps also depict a Cordillera climate, a composite of several

climates.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#132:1> In this text, the mountainous area of northern British Columbia,

Yukon, and Northwest Territories is treated as part of the Subarctic.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#133:1> Elevation and topography have important roles in determining the

nature of the Cordillera climate.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-022#134:1> Another climatic type found in the North, the Ice Cap climate, is

associated with large glaciers, ice caps, and icefields, and has a mean

temperature below freezing for all months. <O> Table 2.1 </O> <O> Table 2.1
