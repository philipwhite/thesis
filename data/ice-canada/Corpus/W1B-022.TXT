<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#1:1> <h> To whom it may concern: </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#2:1> I am very pleased to write this Letter of Recommendation on behalf

of Ms. <@> Sandra Hurley </@> , Dr. <@> Nicholas Joyce </@> , Mr. <@>

Sebastian Herrera </@> and Ms. <@> Sarah Poletto </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#3:1> <bold> <@> On the Button </@> </bold> impresses me as being an

exciting and innovative venture with the potential for success. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#4:1> During the past seven months I have called upon this creative team

on several occasions to assist me in presentations made to various groups:

the Partners in Industry Breakfast hosted by the Faculty; the orientation

seminars for English and French CEGEP advisors; the live video conference

presentation to <foreign> <it> La conf&eacute;rence int&eacute;rnationale sur

la technologie et l'&eacute;ducation europ&eacute;ene </it> </foreign> in

Blois, France; and, most recently, the Faculty's Spring Convocation ceremony

at <indig> Place des Arts </indig> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#5:1> All of these presentations required being able to communicate

messages clearly and powerfully to diverse audiences, and I was impressed by

the team's ability to grasp quickly the distinct objectives in each case and

to develop an accurate and creative interpretation of the information to be

conveyed.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#6:1> Their technical abilities in computer-integrated media design and

production and their intrinsic artistic ability were indispensable to the

success which each of these presentations gained.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#7:1> Complementing this technical and creative competence was their total

dedication and readiness to complete the task, often within very short time

frames. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#8:1> I have been extremely satisfied at all times with the

professionalism and expertise exhibited by Ms. <@> Hurley </@> , Dr. <@>

Joyce </@> , Mr. <@> Herrera </@> and Ms. <@> Poletto </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#9:1> I recommend them highly and urge you to lend whatever support you can

to their project. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#10:1> Yours sincerely, <@> David D. Moretti, Dean </@> </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#11:2> I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation on behalf of

<@> Manuel Salvatore </@> , who has applied for admission to the Department

of Communication Studies. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#12:2> I have known <@> Manuel </@> for the last two months subsequent

to his father's request that I meet with him to see if I could help orient

him in his university studies.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#13:2> I have known <@> Manuel </@> 's father for over fifteen years. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#14:2> <@> Manuel </@> expressed to me his desire to pursue studies in

the area of communications and his interest in applying to the department.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#15:2> I made him aware of the procedure for application and explained to

him the necessity to know exactly what our program is about and to that end,

advised that he visit the department to talk with our students to get a

better feeling for the nature of our program. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#16:2> I met <@> Manuel </@> on several occasions thereafter to give him

my feedback on his application.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#17:2> I did not see the portfolio that he submitted nor do I know who his

referees are.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#18:2> I did read his letter of intention, which he drafted without any

input on my part, and I made some minor editorial recommendations.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#19:2> I also asked him to provide me with a term / research paper he had

written recently so that I could get a sense of his ability to do research,

organize his thoughts and articulate them intelligently.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#20:2> He submitted to me a paper he wrote for an Art History class at

<indig> <@> l'Universit&eacute; de Lune </@> </indig> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#21:2> I explain all this in order to provide you with some background

for my input.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#22:2> This letter is written in the context of the process I put him

through which allows me, I believe, to provide a more informed

recommendation. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#23:2> His marks at <indig> <@> l'Universit&eacute; de Lune </@>

</indig> are poor, quite poor.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#24:2> He explained to me that they are a reflection of his lack of

motivation for the course of study in which he is currently engaged while

waiting to get into the program which corresponds to his interests.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#25:2> This could, or could not be the case. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#26:2> The one thing that does tend to make me give him the benefit of

the doubt, though slight, are his marks at <indig> <@> Coll&egrave;ge Pierre

</@> </indig> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#27:2> This is an extremely demanding institution in the French tradition

and I noticed that <@> Manuel </@> , for the greater part, held his marks up

well in comparison to his peers at <@> Pierre </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#28:2> He is mostly on average with the group and in some cases, above

average, which leads me to believe that his intellectual aptitudes are

greater that what his <@> UdeL </@> marks reflect. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#29:2> I was impressed with his letter of intention, both for its form

and content.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#30:2> I found his written English to be extremely acceptable for a person

who has been through the French education system.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#31:2> In addition, he manifested in this letter a good understanding of

what the department does and how that fits in with his personal aspirations.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#32:2> In addition, I believe that he is the kind of student who can do

well in our department.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#33:2> He strikes me as being a creative and sensitive individual who would

flourish in our environment.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#34:2> As class president for two years at <@> Pierre </@> , he certainly

has the leadership and teamwork qualities essential to make a positive

contribution to both the department and subsequently the profession.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#35:2> Finally, he is an articulate, pleasant and, on the basis of what I

have been able to observe, resourceful individual whose multicultural

background and experience would be an asset for fellow students and

professors alike. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#36:2> I am pleased to recommend that <@> Manuel Salvatore </@> be

considered for admission to the department and I am ready to provide whatever

additional information you may require. </p>

<I>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#38:3> <h> To Whom It May Concern: </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#39:3> I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation on behalf of

<@> Simona Ronchi </@> , who has applied for the position of Commissioner of

the <@> Missa Institute </@> in Italy. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#40:3> I have known Ms. <@> Ronchi </@> since 1982, when she was an

undergraduate student in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics

and I was Dean of Humanities at <@> Capital University </@> , Montreal,

Canada. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#41:3> <@> Simona </@> was an outstanding student of Italian language

and literature.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#42:3> Well-respected by her professors and student colleagues, she also

played a leading role in the life of the department.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#43:3> She starred in several Italian theater productions of works by

Goldoni and proved to be an able and eloquent spokesperson for her

constituency. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#44:3> Subsequent to her graduation, <@> Simona </@> became involved

with the <@> Italian Commercial Group </@> in Canada and quickly rose to the

position of director-general which she occupies today.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#45:3> Here again, I had the pleasure of collaborating with her between 1988

and 1992 during which time I occupied the position of <@> Quebec Envoy </@>

in Italy.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#46:3> Posted in Rome, with the responsibility for the operations in all of

Italy, I worked closely with <@> Simona </@> in the organization of major

economic, cultural and institutional missions and events between Quebec and

Italy.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#47:3> Most notable among these were the <indig> " <@> Forums

Italie-Qu&eacute;bec </@> " </indig> organized in 1989 ( Quebec) and 1991 (

Italy). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#48:3> These events included the participation of a large number of

representatives from the economic, political, educational and institutional

domains.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#49:3> <@> Simona </@> 's organizational abilities proved invaluable in

helping the <@> Quebec Envoys </@> in Italy provide for all the participants

the most comprehensive and meaningful program of visits possible. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#50:3> <@> Simona Ronchi </@> has gained the recognition and respect of

the leaders of the economic, cultural, educational and institutional circles

in Quebec and in key areas in Italy such as Rome and Milan.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#51:3> An excellent organizer, an articulate communicator in three languages

and a natural leader, she possesses the skill and the poise necessary to

navigate easily in high circles on both sides of the Atlantic. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#52:3> I believe she would be an exciting choice as Commissioner of the

<@> Missa Institute </@> in Italy and I have no doubt that she would be able

to meet this challenge with great success. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#53:3> For all these reasons, I recommend her without hesitation for

this position and I would be pleased to answer any questions that you may

have. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#55:4> Dear Dr. <@> Brown </@> , I am very pleased to write this letter

of recommendation on behalf of Ms. <@> Kristina Teddiman </@> in her

application for a <@> Wonder University </@> fellowship.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#56:4> I have known her for three-and-a-half years in my capacity of Dean of

the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#57:4> <@> Kristina </@> was the Faculty's Communications Officer from

June 1993 to November 1995.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#58:4> Her duties were diverse and required that she demonstrate

flexibility, imagination and the ability to balance a number of projects at

any given time.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#59:4> Among her duties, she was responsible for researching the Faculty

presentations to senior administration, industrial and government research

partners, CEGEP advisors, and others.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#60:4> These presentations were always highly effective and well-received.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#61:4> <@> Kristina </@> left her position to return to full-time

studies in Fall of 1995; however, she has continued to work in the Faculty on

a part-time basis and is currently the Co-ordinator of our Native Access to

Engineering program as well as the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate

Technical Writing courses.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#62:4> While working in the Faculty she has always been well-organized and

highly committed to her work.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#63:4> These attributes lead me to believe she stands to succeed in any

endeavour she chooses to undertake. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#64:4> With an undergraduate degree in Building Engineering, <@>

Kristina </@> possesses an exciting complement to the work she is currently

pursuing in Media Studies.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#65:4> As you know, she also completed the Diploma in Communication Studies

where she did outstanding work and proved her aptitude in this area.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#66:4> I believe people who have the flexibility to bridge the " hard" and "

soft" disciplines are a rare minority.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#67:4> The insights they gain from these two rather different academic and

professional cultures will prove to be extremely valuable and important in

the ever-evolving economy that is currently upon us.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#68:4> As such, persons who demonstrate that kind of aptitude should be

strongly and vigorously supported by this university. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#69:4> In closing, I recommend <@> Kristina Teddiman </@> to you very

highly and trust the fellowship committee will give her application the most

serious consideration.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#70:4> Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate

to contact me. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#71:4> Sincerely, <@> David D. Moretti </@> </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#72:5> It gives me a great pleasure indeed to write this letter of

recommendation for Ms. <@> Jane Petro </@> in support of her application to

the Ph.D. program in Modern Thought and Literature at <@> Rutherford </@>

University. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#73:5> I have known <@> Jane </@> for the past three years, ever since

she enrolled in <@> Capital </@> 's Communication Studies program.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#74:5> This program is a leader of its kind in North America, has very high

standards, and accepts only students with excellent academic standing. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#75:5> From the outset <@> Jane </@> proved to be among the brightest in

the freshmen class and soon became a top student in the program.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#76:5> For many of my colleagues who have taught her, she was without doubt

the best student they had ever had the privilege to teach.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#77:5> Her record both as a student and as a Teaching Assistant speaks for

itself. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#78:5> While <@> Jane </@> was never in any of my classes, I have had

numerous occasions to meet with her.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#79:5> My discussions with her were always for me highly informative and

typically marked, on <@> Jane </@> 's part, by creative insight, serious

reflection, sense of purpose, and – importantly – a very pleasant

disposition.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#80:5> She is a person who will be successful as a student anywhere she goes

and will enrich any environment in which she finds herself.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#81:5> In this context, I wish to draw your attention to <@> Jane </@> 's

being awarded last year The <@> Capital </@> Medal which goes to an

undergraduate graduating student who has displayed distinctive leadership

ability through both academic and non-academic achievements and has won the

outstanding commendation of his / her fellows and of the faculty. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#82:5> As a graduate of <@> Rutherford </@> University ( Ph.D. Classics,

1972) and therefore as someone obviously familiar with the institution, its

tradition, standards and the excellent quality of education offered, I can

hardly think of a place more conducive to the development of this outstanding

person.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#83:5> I cannot think of any limitations, intellectual or other, that would

prevent her continuing to be an excellent student capable of producing

first-rate, creative, and important scholarship. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#84:5> In closing, I recommend Ms. <@> Peters </@> to you in the highest

terms and trust the admissions committee will give her application the most

serious consideration.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-022#85:5> Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate

to contact me. </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#86:6> I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation for Ms. <@>

Alexandra Isaac </@> in support of her application to the M.A. program in

International Development at <@> Bravo University </@> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-022#87:6> I have known <@> Alexandra </@> for the past two years and more

specifically since she was a student in a Seminar in Propaganda which I

taught in the Fall 1995 semester in <@> Capital </@> 's Communication Studies

program. </p> </I>
