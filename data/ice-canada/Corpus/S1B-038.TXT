<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#1:1:A> Good afternoon and welcome to Free-For-All Weekend <,> edition

where the Free-For-All gang <,,> looks at the news of the past week and makes

some comments about it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#2:1:A> The Free-For-All gang being of course <@> Tim Smith </@> <@> Alan

Rinaldi </@> <@> Eliza Green </@> and <@> George Fraser </@>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#3:1:A> And ah I guess uh uh in Montreal <,> one of the big things that came

out this week although it was early in the week and by now it's kind of uh a

bit in the past but we had a couple polls that came out early in the week
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#4:1:A> Interesting in both cases
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#5:1:A> One case ehm <}> <-> <.> anglos </.> </-> <+> anglophones </+> </}>

suggesting that they're <}> <-> outta </-> <+> out of </+> </}> here in many

cases
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#6:1:A> Although <,> there could be a little exaggeration in that I suppose
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#7:1:A> And in the other case all ah Montrealers including francophones

allophones <&> Canadian meaning is 'someone whose first language is neither

French nor English' </&> and anglophones uh seemingly much more lenient about

what kind of a city Montreal should be <,> ah compared to the people that uh

govern us <}> <-> at all </-> <=> at all </=> </}> levels really

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#8:1:B> I don't think those polls exaggerate in fact they may

understate because <,,> I've seen polls of young people which indicate a

figure as high as seventy-five percent <}> <-> who </-> <=> who </=> </}>

plan to leave
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#9:1:B> And of course for a lot of older people they feel well there's too

late to leave now or their jobs are here or they have a mortgage here but for

younger people that constraint isn't there
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#10:1:B> That <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> of course it's the leaving

of the younger people in the long run that <{> <[> hurts more </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#11:1:A> <[> Mhhm oh ya </[> </{> for sure <,,>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#12:1:C> Well there ah ah number of things that come up from the polls
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#13:1:C> One about the sign issue <&> policy re: signs' language </&> <O>

cough </O> is that the politicians are woefully out of touch with what people

really want or really care about
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#14:1:C> It's indicative that the P Q <&> Parti Quebecois, governing

political party </&> has been <,,> and continues to be obsessed not just with

separation but with language and it is not an obsession with your garden

variety Quebecer
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#15:1:C> They have other things to worry about <,,> like eating for example

<{> <[> <,> </[> or working

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#16:1:A> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[> </{>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#17:1:C> That's more important
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#18:1:C> So I think that uh that the poll indicates that to a great extent
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#19:1:C> And the other thing about <}> <-> the other poll </-> <=> leaving

</=> </}> I don't think is an exaggeration
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#20:1:C> <}> <-> What </-> <=> what </=> </}> I do think it is is are people

going to leave in terms of separation
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#21:1:C> Ya I don't think <}> <-> I </-> <=> I've </=> </}> <O> cough </O>

met or heard too many people on the air who say that if Quebec separate <}>

<-> they would </-> <=> they would </=> </}> leave but that doesn't mean

they're leaving tomorrow <,> or next week or even next year <{> <[> it means

in the event </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#22:1:A> <[> Ya that's the part </[> </{> that I think is exaggeration

in that poll
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#23:1:A> <}> <-> They </-> <=> they're </=> </}> talking about <,> thirty

percent who say they're leaving within five years <,> no matter
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#24:1:A> I'm quite sure that five years ago we had a similar poll that said

<,> thirty percent were leaving within five <{> <[> years no matter </[>

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#25:1:D> <[> We did as a </[> </{> <{> <[> matter of fact </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#26:1:A> <[> Ya ya </[> </{>

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#27:1:D> In nineteen ninety-one we had <{1> <[1> a poll </[1> that said
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#28:1:D> <{2> <[2> exactly </[2> the same thing

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#29:1:A> <[1> Exactly </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#30:1:A> <[2> Exactly </[2> </{2>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#31:1:A> Ya <}> <-> and it </-> <=> and it's </=> </}> easy to say to a ah

pollster you know <,> uh yes you're fed up and the pollster calls and says

what's your view would you leave within a <quote> you bet I would leave

</quote> <}> <-> but a </-> <=> but a </=> </}> lot of people can't

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#32:1:D> <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> think the erosion is already

taking place
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#33:1:D> I think what we're seeing is a ah gradual slip-sliding away of <}>

<-> the English population </-> <=> the English-speaking population </=> </}>

and I think that'll continue
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#34:1:D> People aren't leaving in masses
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#35:1:D> They're leaving as soon as they can sell their house and <,>

reasonably find another job somewhere else
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#36:1:D> I mean they're not <}> <-> <.> le </.> </-> <=> leaving </=> </}>

because they want to they're leaving because they can't <,> picture a

continuance of life as they've had here in the future
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#37:1:D> And that's why they're going
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#38:1:D> <}> <-> I ah </-> <=> there </=> </}> are a lot of houses for <{>

<[> sale that </[> don't have signs in front of them

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#39:1:A> <[> Oh ya </[> </{>

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#40:1:D> Ah a lot of people that I've talked to have quietly said

<quote> ya well our future isn't here <}> <-> we're just ah </-> <=> we're

finding </=> </}> our way out of here </quote>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#41:1:C> Getting back to what <@> Alan </@> was saying about the young

people I mean there is a certain segment of the <}> <-> <.> anglo </.> </->

<+> anglophone </+> </}> population who have no children here <,> anymore
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#42:1:C> I mean there's a <{> <[> segment </[> of the population where uh

their children two or three of them not one of them lives in Montreal

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#43:1:A> <[> Mhhm </[> </{>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#44:1:C> The vast majority live <}> <-> in </-> <=> somewhere </=> </}>

else in North America
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#45:1:C> And there are other segments of the population where you know two

out of three have left or one out of three have left or one is planning to go

or <,> once the kid is in graduate school <}> <-> or </-> <=> or </=> </}>

university somewhere well why come back
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#46:1:C> That's the erosion <,,> that's the hardest part of it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#47:1:C> Not just for the community but also <@> Alan </@> <}> <-> <}> <->

in your </-> <=> in your </=> </}> living <,,> </-> <=> make a living <}> <->

as a </-> <=> as a </=> </}> professor </=> </}> <,> kids will leave <,> and

if you don't have a base from which to choose from the locals <,> ah you have

to reach out more and that gets harder to fund and all the other stuff that

goes with it

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#48:1:B> Ya if you look at the English schools they've been cut more

than half in last twenty years
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#49:1:B> Well <}> <-> that </-> <=> that </=> </}> you know that catches up

that hits the universities eventually
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#50:1:B> I remember being <}> <-> in <,> </-> <=> on </=> </}> the radio

about two years ago with some professors who were saying <quote> oh it's

never going to happen they'll keep coming </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#51:1:B> I said where're they going to come from
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#52:1:B> <{> <[> Well </[> it's happening of course

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#53:1:A> <[> Mhhm </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#54:1:B> Enrollments are dropping in the universities now

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#55:1:D> But they are dropping <{> <[> all over North America </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#56:1:B> <[> They are dropping all over </[> </{> North America but

we're going to get it worse because <{> <[> the base you draw from </[>

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#57:1:D> <[> Have we gotten it worse </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#58:1:B> Ya oh ya

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#59:1:D> Have we gotten it worse <{1> <[1> is there </[1> a greater

drop in enrollment in Montreal
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#60:1:D> <{2> <[2> universities than elsewhere in North America <,,> I'm not

sure of that </[2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#61:1:B> <[1> <unclear> word </unclear> </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#62:1:B> <[2> <unclear> word </unclear> <,,> <}> <-> we'll know better

</[2> </{2> </-> <=> we'll know better </=> </}> cos this just started uh

last year and we'll know better when we see the figures for the coming year

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#63:1:A> I think <@> El </@> makes a good point about oldsters too <}>

<-> <}> <-> there </-> <=> there </=> </}> comes a point uh in <,> </-> <=>

many elderly people in Montreal they're sure enough they're kids aren't here

<,> uh and when they get to a point when they need special care <,> there's

nobody here to care for them </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#64:1:A> So <}> <-> if </-> <=> if </=> </}> your son and your daughter and

all of their family are now living in Missisauga <,> when it comes time to be

looked after I guess you <}> <-> gotta </-> <+> got to </+> </}> go to <{>

<[> Missisauga </[>

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#65:1:D> <[> But </[> </{> now there is a problem because they are the

ones that are least capable of pulling up roots and <{> <[> leaving </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#66:1:A> <[> Ya </[> </{> <{> <[> I </[>

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#67:1:D> <}> <-> <[> That's </[> </{> the real </-> <=> <}> <-> <.> th

</.> </-> <=> there's </=> </}> the rub </=> </}> and that's why we have to

<.> soc </.> </-> <+> social </+> </}> that's why we shouldn't flee we should

fight because we have to ensure that those that can't flee are protected

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#68:1:A> Well that's right <,> <@> Tim </@> but if it comes a point

where you're going to go into the nursing home and your pensions are going to

pay your way it might as well be a nursing home in Colberg or Missisauga

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#69:1:D> <}> <-> But you <}> <-> <.> pen </.> </-> <+> pension </+>

</}> I'm <.> col </.> </-> <=> correct me if I'm wrong </=> </}> but it's

very difficult if you're <}> <-> on the <.> b </.> </-> <=> on the bottom

you Canada and Quebec pensions it's very hard to make the transition from one

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#70:1:A> Oh no <,> no <,> <{> <[> <}> <-> your </-> <=> your </=> </}>

<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#76:1:C> <{1> <[1> Not all the provinces </[1> publicly funded old peoples's

<ICE-CAN:S1B-038#77:1:C> <{2> <[2> like we do in Quebec </[2>

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#78:1:D> <[1> That's what I mean <,> ya </[1> </{1>

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#79:1:D> <[2> Well that's what I mean </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#85:1:B> <[> But </[> </{> it's also a question that if you're living

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-038#124:2:B> Ah because ah for a variety of reasons <,> that it was

something out of a movie that happened on the <{> <[> high seas </[> and that

Canada got involved almost by accident because the boat happened to be here

and the eight Filipino sailors <,> asked for refugee status <,> because the R
