<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#1:1> <h> <bold> Is Unix really open? </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#2:1> So you've decided on Unix.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#3:1> But have you decided on which Unix? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#4:1> You're probably letting your hardware decide for you.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#5:1> After all, the vendor of hardware will likely belong to one of two

groups, Unix International ( UI) or the Open Software Foundation ( OSF). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#6:1> Maybe you'll let the software or the application deter <l> mine

which choice you make.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#7:1> Don't count on it.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#8:1> Most software firms are hedging their bets by, at least for now,

committing to both the UI and OSF groups.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#9:1> ( See story, for example, Computer Associates commits to Unix, p. 21).

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#10:1> But why not try this test?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#11:1> Ask your supplier if their version of Unix is open. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#12:1> Why do we raise this question now?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#13:1> It has to do with the great momentum behind open systems and the

continuing uncertainty around other operating systems.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#14:1> ( See stories, p.1).
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#15:1> Open systems may yet force the issue between which version of Unix

will emerge as the standard. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#16:1> Not surprisingly, David Sandel, vice-president of marketing, Unix

International has stated that he sees <quote> " Unix System V as the base of

open systems." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#17:1> What this talk does is set up a confrontation by turning the road

to open systems into a collision course for competing versions of Unix. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#18:1> If everybody wants open systems, it stands to reason that they

will only want one version of an open system.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#19:1> And if they only want one version of open systems that is based on

Unix, then one of the two is sure to face extinction. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#20:1> It's too early to tell if users will go the UI or the OSF route.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#21:1> Nor do we have any way of knowing if one of the two versions is

technically superior to the other. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#22:1> But the hype around open systems seems to have the effect of

forcing this issue earlier than we expected.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#23:1> Users should look now for signs of one version dominating the other.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#24:1> The early returns place UI's version in front.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#25:1> Said AT&T Canada's Benjamin Scott at the recent Open Systems show in

Ottawa: <quote> " By the end of 1990, more than 300 companies were shipping

products based on System V release 4 platforms. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#X26:1> With those kind of numbers, the UI version has the best chance of

becoming the standard around which open systems will flourish. </X> "

</quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#27:1> In contrast, users, as IBM and others have done, should raise

some serious concerns about AT&T's ownership of Unix System V. (
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#28:1> Although, it should be noted that AT&T is negotiating to sell off as

much of the 40 per cent of its Unix operating system). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#29:1> If an open system is all about being non-proprietary, users may

yet look to the OSF for direction. </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#35:2> <it> Paul Swinwood is president, Learning Tree International, a

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#36:2> Times are tough out there.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#37:2> Sales managers are reporting lost sales, production managers are

reporting low backlogs, CEOs are warning of layoffs and controllers are

calling for cut <l> ting expenses. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#38:2> What can a manager do?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#39:2> First no travel, no training, no more giveaways - cut expenses.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#40:2> Con <l> gratulations, well done. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#41:2> That solution may be too simple.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#42:2> A leading edge, competi <l> tive company, however, will con <l> tinue

to spend on two major areas during a recession: future projects and future

productivity. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#43:2> Successful companies plan carefully, review projects an <l>

nually and focus on products, productivity and most impor <l> tantly, people.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#44:2> As a training institution, we typically feel the downturn sig <l>

nificantly as our clients freeze spending.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#45:2> In our experience, the major successful players in the technology

fields react well to market pressures and then focus on the resources

available. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#46:2> Some tips on using these resources include: <l>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#47:2> &bullet; review your current product and procedures for short-term

productivity gains.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#48:2> Can better training improve productivity of the staff;
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#49:2> &bullet; review your development needs.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#50:2> Could training cut development costs and time re <l> quired to bring

your newest product to the market quicker and gain a market edge; and,
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#51:2> &bullet; review your staff needs.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#52:2> Could training provide the morale boost and productivity improve <l>

ment to weather these tough times?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#53:2> Most training can be brought to your location.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#54:2> You save on travel, staff availability costs and gain productivity im

<l> mediately because the training is focused on your environment and needs.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#55:2> Tough times call for tough measures, but the wise manager recognizes

training remains important. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#57:3> </bold> <it> Mark Skapinker </it> </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#58:3> Mark Skapinker is a co-founder and president of Delrina

Technology Inc. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#59:3> He is credited with helping to define and to promote the forms

processing market through his participation in product innovation and a

number of industry engagements.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#60:3> Under his direction, Delrina's PerForm software has garnered a number

of industry awards. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#61:3> Prior to Delrina, he was director of product development for

Batteries Included, before its acquisition by Electronic Arts. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#62:3> He has a post-graduate diploma in computer science from the

University of Jerusalem. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#63:3> He recently spoke to <it> Computing Canada </it> editor Martin

Slofstra at Delrina's head office in Toronto. </p> <O> picture </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#64:3> <h> <bold> <it> Derlina Technology Inc. </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#65:3> Delrina Technology Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of

Toronto-based Delrina Corp. and is recognized as a leading supplier of

PC-based graphics forms processing software.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#66:3> It claims nearly 100,000 units shipped. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#67:3> Other subsidiaries of Delrina are Carolian Systems ( data centre

management systems for HP 3000) and a 51 per cent share of SoftPort

Technologies, distributors of accounting software. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#68:3> In April 1990, IBM Canada Ltd. acquired a 11 per cent stake,

representing the first such investment by IBM in a Canadian software company.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#69:3> Delrina Corp. also has offices in Ottawa, Los Gatos, Calif.,

Washington D.C. and England.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#70:3> Revenues for the period ending June 30, 1990 were &dollar;8.1

million, up from &dollar;5.0 million the year before. </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <it>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#71:4> CC: How would you define forms processing and what does it include?

</it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#72:4> Skapinker: Forms processing is basically the computerization of

forms.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#73:4> It takes parts of many other technologies and brings them all

together.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#74:4> In other words, it takes the printing, WYSIWYG ( What You See Is What

You Get) and complete page layout aspects of desktop publishing, the database

data entry elements from database, printing technology, font tech <l> nology

and it also includes com <l> munications. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#75:4> <it> CC: Who in the organization would control the forms pro <l>

cessing function? </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#76:4> Skapinker: I think it depends on the size of the organization.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#77:4> What we've done is we've split our product line completely down the

middle.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#78:4> So we have regular PerForm, which is really aimed at the entry-level

or smaller business, where it's the owner-operator or the administrative

people who look after the forms.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#79:4> Then we've got our PerForm Pro, which is really aimed at the high-end

of the marketplace. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#80:4> Certain companies may have a forms department.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#81:4> The admin <l> istrative people may look after it, and often, the

financial people look after it.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#82:4> Certainly the MIS people look after only a certain kind of form.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#83:4> However, it's the senior managers beyond the in <l> dividual

departments, who really see the hidden cost of forms and the advantage of

forms pro <l> cessing. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#84:4> <it> CC: Are organizations starting to integrate their forms pro

<l> cessing function with their overall information strategy? </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#85:4> Skapinker: Very much so.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#86:4> There is no need to fill in a form on paper and then re-enter the

data in afterwards.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#87:4> It makes absolute sense to be building the form into an existing

network of ma <l> chines or communication of ma <l> chines, get the data in,

be able to use it anywhere within the or <l> ganization, and of course, get

rid of a lot of the waste. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#88:4> Why keep writing your name and address on 50 different forms when

you only really need to update your address once and it will appear on any

other forms? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#89:4> <it> CC: Forms processing is one application that is said to be

ideal for client / server applica <l> tions.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#90:4> Do you see that as so? </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#91:4> Skapinker: If you ever look at the type of money that people are

currently spending on paper forms, it starts becoming far more realistic.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#92:4> There's huge costs based in terms of processing a form.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#93:4> The cost of processing a form, com <l> pared to the cost of printing

a paper form is about 50 or 60 to one.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#94:4> So for every dollar that you spend on buying a paper form, you spend

&dollar;60 on processing that form. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#95:4> For years, we heard about how the industry had managed to

computerize itself, and small office functionality had been able to

computerize itself, yet when it came to the large overall management of an

office, it has never been able to get comput <l> erized.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#96:4> It's really quite interest <l> ing to have a look why this has never

happened. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#97:4> A lot of this is that the hard <l> ware hasn't been there.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#98:4> You need the graphics hardware, you need laser printers, you need

networks, you need a database which exists out there on a client/server

basis. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#99:4> With that all in place, we now have the ability to pull all this

together and actually computer <l> ize the communications between individuals

in an office, which is forms processing.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#100:4> I think the opportunity is enormous in terms of real live users and

the application of form processing in the office. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#101:4> <it> CC: So electronic mail, for example, could be done in the

way of forms when you intro <l> duce a large enough user base? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#102:4> Skapinker: I don't think that people think in terms of elec <l>

tronic mail.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#103:4> When I go on a business trip and I come back and I fill in an

expense form, I want one copy to go to my manager who is going to sign it

off. </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#104:4> My manager, once he's signed it off, will probably send it

through to the accounting department who will generate a cheque and send that

cheque back to me.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#105:4> I don't think of that as electronic mail.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#106:4> I think of that as the routing and the pro <l> cessing of the form

that I've just filled in. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#107:4> When I've sat with an em <l> ployee and gone through an employee

evaluation process, and I file that away in their file, I don't think of that

as mail or database.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#108:4> I just think of it as, well I've now written this form and I've

filled this in, let's put it away. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#109:4> One of the big advantages of form processing is it gets rid of

all the jargon of having to update your database, electronically send a piece

of information from one person to another and put it in terms that people

understand. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#110:4> <it> CC: Are you saying that the form is a good way to auto <l>

mate your business because it's what people can relate to? </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#111:4> Skapinker: It's proven.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#112:4> Every business uses forms as a means of communication and can re <l>

late to a means of communica <l> tion. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#113:4> Part of the difficulty is that people on the entry-level, com

<l> puter level really are looking for a means of communicating and using

computers.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#114:4> When they re <l> ally got into word processing, which is what a lot

of them do, it really just replaced the type-writer. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#115:4> Why is WordPerfect the most popular word processor?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#116:4> Be <l> cause it's the most similar to a typewriter. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#117:4> <it> CC: Forms processing is a hot market for you now.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#118:4> But what do you to do for an encore and how do you avoid becoming a

one product company? </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#119:4> Skapinker: The software in <l> dustry has shown over and over

that positioning and market share is very, very important. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#120:4> When we started off, our initial aim was to become the market

leader.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#121:4> Within a one-and-one-half to two-year period, we became the market

leader both in the high-end and the low-end.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#122:4> Our intention is to remain there.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#123:4> We have a strategic relationship with IBM, that can maybe lead

straight into that. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#124:4> By creating a strategic rela <l> tionship with market leaders,

such as IBM, our credibility factor goes up, and our chances of remaining in

the market as a market leader, remain very high.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#125:4> Certainly IBM today owns 11 per cent of Delrina.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#126:4> We are the only Canadian software company that IBM has invested in.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#127:4> <it> CC: Do you see yourself diver <l> sifying into different

products or building on forms pro <l> cessing? </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-032#128:4> Skapinker: You will see us build <l> ing on forms processing.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#129:4> How <l> ever, other related graphics business-type applications may

become quite interesting to us.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#130:4> Our long-term aim is to be a leading grahics business soft <l> ware

Canadian publisher.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#131:4> And whatever it takes to do that, you will find us doing.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-032#132:4> Certainly, once an infrastructure is built, it will make sense for

us to expand into other products. </p> </I>
