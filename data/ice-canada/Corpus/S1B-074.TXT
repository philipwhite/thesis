<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#4:1:A> Because I'm not sure

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#5:1:B> Well it depends what are you looking <.> f </.> like are you

looking for skis or are you looking for boots or are you looking for

everything <,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#6:1:A> Well <,> okay I guess well I'll start with the skis <{> <[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#10:1:A> Uhm <,> I've been skiing <,,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#14:1:A> Uhm <,> I would say <,> intermediate

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#18:1:B> And <,> how much do you weigh

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#19:1:A> <,> Weigh
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#20:1:A> <O> laugh starts </O> Secret question <O> laugh ends </O>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#21:1:A> About a hundred and twenty

<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#23:1:B> <}> <-> The reason why </-> <=> The reason why </=> </}> I ask

people <}> <-> why <,> why </-> <=> how much </=> </}> they weigh <{> <[> <,>

is </[> we need to accomodate we need to be able to find the skier some <?>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#24:1:A> <[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#25:1:A> Why

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#26:1:B> <unclear> Two words </unclear> length as well as weight

because one thing that's <?> important </?> when you're looking <}> <-> for

skiing </-> <,> <=> for a good ski </=> </}> is uh <,> you need your weight

to be evenly distributed throughout the ski
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#27:1:B> <unclear> Two or three words </unclear> because what happens is

you're not using the tip of your ski <,> and then with that you lose a lot of

grip on the ice and <}> <-> you <unclear> word </unclear> </-> <=> you're not

</=> </}> getting enough of the ski
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#28:1:B> Your legs are more balanced on the ski <,> <?> there </?> than

using maximum leverage on the ski and you gain more control

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#29:1:A> <?> Well </?> <,> wait a second I don't understand <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#30:1:A> Depending on how much I <{1> <[1> weigh </[1> you <}> <-> put the

</-> <=> put
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#31:1:A> <{2> <[2> the </=> </}> binding in the </[2> right place

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#32:1:B> <[1> Mm hmm </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#33:1:B> <[> Well it depends </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#34:1:B> No no <}> <-> it it's more </-> <=> it's more like </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#35:1:B> <}> <-> <@> Jerry's </@> <@> Jerry's </@> a </-> <,> <=> <@>

Jerry's </@> <.> g </.> a </=> </}> good skier <,> right
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#36:1:B> <@> Jerry's </@> <?> around </?> your height and weight
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#37:1:B> If you have somebody that's uh <,> two hundred and twelve odd

pounds for example you <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> put them on a

ski that's <}> <-> a hundred </-> <=> a hundred </=> </}> and seventy-seven

centimetres in length <{> <[> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#38:1:B> Because </[> ideally <,> we want the weight to be evenly

distributed around the ski

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#39:1:A> <[> Mm hmm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#40:1:A> Mm hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#41:1:B> The reason for this <,> is what happens if the weight is too

concentrated in the centre the person weighs too much <,> for the ski the ski

is not long enough <,> what'll happen <,> is that the person is not able the

ski <?> does </?> not functioning <,> to that person's ability
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#42:1:B> <}> <-> But what'll <.> ha </.> </-> <=> But you might </=> </}>

throughout the ski

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#43:1:A> <{> <[> Okay <&> drawn out </&> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#44:1:B> <[> So what </[> </{> happens is so for example <?> when

people are </?> on ice <,> the ski will lose its grip

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#45:1:A> <,> Oh <}> <-> so that's </-> <=> so that's </=> </}> the

whole point <,> of having different length skis <{> <[> <,,> is </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#46:1:B> <[> <,> Right
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#47:1:B> <?> It </?> </[> </{> varies according to your height and to your

weight

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#48:1:A> And your weight
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#49:1:A> Okay so it's both combined
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#50:1:A> Cos yeah I always knew the height but I didn't know the weight

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#51:1:B> Right

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#52:1:A> So <}> <-> don't </-> <=> aren't </=> </}> you <}> <-> gonna

</-> <+> going to </+> </}> ask me how tall I am or <,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#53:1:B> Well uh actually I can see how tall you are

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#56:1:B> I <unclear> word </unclear>

have a ski <?> right there so I <?> can line it up <unclear> word </unclear>

<?> body </?>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#58:1:B> For a beginner skier we usually go head height <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#59:1:B> The intermediate skier you usually want between five and fifteen

centimetres over your head
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#60:1:B> <?> There's a </?> <unclear> word </unclear> to five inches

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#61:1:A> <{> <[> Right </[>

<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#78:1:B> What the hell was I saying <,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#79:1:A> You were talking about the length of the ski

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#86:1:B> Ya

the skier is the first and foremost important thing to worry about

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#89:1:B> <[> It's not always </[> </{> <?> that </?> important to go

for their needs
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#93:1:B> Like you <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> find them the

<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#94:1:B> You know something that they can <?> use </?>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#95:1:B> Cos it's no fun it's like <,> if somebody goes out to buy a Porsche

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#96:1:A> <{> <[> Right right </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#98:1:A> Right

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#99:1:B> So <,> ideally what you <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#102:1:B> Uhm <,> do you need ski boots

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#105:1:B> Ya

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#106:1:A> Well I'll take a look at the boots <,,> but uh <,> the truth

right up to <,> let's see here <unclear> two or three words </unclear> but uh

<,> uh around two hundred dollars <?> depending </?>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#124:1:B> <[> And that's </[> </{> so yeah some of these prices have

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#125:1:B> So the savings <}> <-> are </-> <=> are </=> </}> you know

quite <,> quite uhm you know uh

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#126:1:A> Significant

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#128:1:A> <}> <-> How </-> <=> How </=> </}> come you guys have such

<,> you know <,> good prices
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#129:1:A> Like why do you get <?> a </?> good deal

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#130:1:B> So what we do is we're liquidating all of our own equipment

and all <?> the old </?> equipment <}> <-> for </-> uh <=> for </=> </}>

somebody else and uh
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#131:1:B> So it's worked out we get to make a profit off some of that money

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#132:1:A> You mean for some companies that haven't sold their equipment

you're liquidating for them

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#133:1:B> Exactly

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#134:1:A> Oh <?> okay </?>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#135:1:B> So this is where actually uh somebody <unclear> three or four

words </unclear> <@> Thomas </@> we liquidate his equipment and as we said we

make some of the money <,> off him and he makes some of the money off us <{>

<[> so </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#136:1:A> <[> Okay </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#137:1:B> <}> <-> <.> I </.> </-> <+> It's </+> </}> a good balance
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#138:1:B> Yeah it's a good
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#139:1:B> <?> Absolutely </?> there are things that it helps uh <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#140:1:B> Yeah it works for both people and <}> <-> helps uh it helps us get

</-> you know <,> <=> it helps us to <}> <-> make </-> <=> raise </=> </}>

money more </=> </}> so that we can compete on the circuit <,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#141:1:A> I see
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#142:1:A> So <,> basically you're making money for your ski team you get a

<?> nice </?> big deal and you're liquidating their <{> <[> stock </[> so

everybody's <,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#143:1:B> <[> Mm hmm </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#144:1:B> Exactly <}> <-> everybody </-> <=> everybody </=> </}>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#145:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#146:1:A> So what's the difference between these boots like uh <,> I mean

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#150:1:A> Cos are these ones like one thirty these ones're two thirty

so it's something
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#151:1:A> Okay <}> <-> look <.> a </.> </-> <=> take </=> </}> these two

what's the difference between them

</-> <=> there's </=> </}> a little bit of a difference in the sense that

this one was ah <,> actually a woman's boot and this one's a men's boot
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#153:1:B> <{1> <[1> And </[1> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#154:1:B> <{2> <[2> in terms </[2> of

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#155:1:A> <[1> Okay </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#156:1:A> <[2> <}> <-> Why uh </-> </[2> </{2> <=> Why </=> </}> do men

and women need different <{> <[> <,> boots </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#157:1:B> <[> Well <,> </[> </{> generally the thing is is that uh most

of men's feet are a little bit <unclear> word </unclear> shaped a bit

differently than women's feet to be a bit <,> wider <,> and uh to be a bit

longer <,> as well
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#158:1:B> Most of the time <,> <}> <-> most </-> <=> most </=> </}> men

usually weigh <,> a bit more <,> than women and therefore they need a little

bit <,> stiffer boot
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#159:1:B> But ah each boot varies according to the ability of the skier

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#160:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#161:1:B> For example <,> this one here's a beginner boot

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#162:1:A> <,> Why is it a beginn <?> ing </?> boot like what <{> <[>

makes it <unclear> word </unclear> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#163:1:B> <[> Well <,> what makes </[> </{> it a beginner boot

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#164:1:B> Well the thing is is when you're looking at a <?> different

<?> boot <,> is you're looking at uh <,> not so much <?> career </?> but <}>

<-> you're looking more at </-> uh <=> you're looking more in terms </=> </}>

of uh the flex of the boot <,> uhm the stiffness of the boot rigidity <,>

what kind of support it offers <,> and whether it flexes a lot or they don't

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#165:1:B> See it all varies and <?> when </?> you have a beginner skier it's

really important that they're able to bend their knees and to <,> apply

pressure to the skis in order to complete the turn

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#166:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#167:1:B> And <}> <-> what's happened is uh <,> if </-> <=> <}> <->

what happens is </-> if you put a beginner skier <,> in an advanced boot <,>

<=> what happens is </=> </}> the boot's so stiff <,> is that they're </=>

</}> <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> have a lot of problems turning

the ski because they're not able to transfer pressure from the foot <,> onto

the ski
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#168:1:B> Therefore <,> and vice versa with an advanced skier <,> if you

have somebody <?> who <?> 're very heavy or very strong <,> <?> then that

weight </?> is <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> crush the boot and

the boot will not control according <{> <[> to the weight </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#169:1:A> <[> I'm sorry </[> </{> what their weight is <}> <-> gonna

</-> <+> going to </+> </}> crush the boot <?> or </?> because

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#170:1:B> Their weight and their strength the weight <unclear> word

</unclear> the ski <?> it varies </?> right
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#171:1:B> <}> <-> It It </-> <=> It </=> </}> really depends

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#172:1:A> Right

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#173:1:B> And in general when you have somebody who's <}> <-> a </->

<,> <?> like </?> <=> a </=> </}> more advanced skier <,> you have someone

who's a more advanced skier they tend to be a little bit more aggressive uhm
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#174:1:B> These are all important <{> <[> questions </[> that we ask or we

asked a skier <}> <-> before </-> <=> before </=> </}> outfitting them

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#175:1:A> <[> <unclear> word </unclear> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#176:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#177:1:B> So <}> <-> what happens </-> <=> the reason why </=> </}> we

ask so many questions sometimes <,> people can become offended when we're

asking <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#178:1:B> You know they become a little bit <unclear> word </unclear> why

are you asking so many <{> <[> questions
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#179:1:B> But </[> the only reason why is <}> <-> that </-> <=> that </=>

</}> you can best you know <}> <-> <.> out </.> <.> out </.> </-> <=> outfit

</=> </}> the needs of the skier to the best support <unclear> word

</unclear>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#180:1:A> <[> Mm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#181:1:A> Right

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#182:1:B> To their needs

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#183:1:A> Right <,> <?> okay </?>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#184:1:B> That's why we ask so many questions

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#185:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#186:1:B> But uhm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#187:1:A> So this one's a beginner boot so that probably wouldn't be

good for me <,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#188:1:B> Uhm <,> no
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#189:1:B> But you see that's the other thing too is sometimes <}> <-> if you

have an advanced if you have a </-> <=> if you have a beginner skier </=>

</}> <,> who weighs you know <,> three hundred and eighty pounds if you have

<}> <-> a </-> you know <,> ah <,> <=> a </=> </}> pleasantly plump <,>

customer <{> <[> <}> <-> who ah </[> <,> who wants </-> <=> you know who

would like to </=> </}> ski <,> <}> <-> the <,> in some ways you want </->

<,> <=> chances are <,> that uh </=> </}> <}> <-> <.> hi </.> </-> <+> his

</+> </}> weight <,> <}> <-> will most likely </-> <=> <,> he'll need </=>

</}> a bit of a stiffer boot because he weighs a lot more and therefore he

needs the support

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#190:1:A> <[> Mm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#191:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#192:1:A> So he <?> 'll </?> take a more advanced boot not because he's a

good skier but because he's <,> big

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-074#193:1:B> Right
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#194:1:B> Totally
<ICE-CAN:S1B-074#195:1:B> <}> <-> You're not </-> <=> You're not </=> </}> <}> <-> gonna

</-> <+> going to </+> </}> sell him the top of the line boot because the

thing is he's not <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> use that <{> <[>

but </[> at the same time you <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> get

something </I>
