<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#5:1> As I was telling you — you're from Georgia, you said?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#6:1> Well, as I was saying I couldn't help feeling that everything that had

ever happened in the journey that is my life until then came to bear on the

runaway, careening conversation I was having with Sergeant Robert McRoberts

at District Station No. 2 of the York Regional Police on Major MacKenzie

Road, in the busy but still pretty town I live in, Richmond Hill, Ontario,

Canada.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#7:1> You see, I knew it was important just how I told the sergeant about

the dream I'd had about my missing husband.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#8:1> My intention was to communicate with him in his own Canadian idiom.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#9:1> First, I would speak only in my from-nowhere-in-particular TV

broadcaster's voice.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#10:1> Experience has taught me that if this Ontario policeman got so much

as a whiff of my Texas accent his eyes would have glazed over like cherry

filling in a cooling pie, terrified I might hog-tie him, and force-feed him

chili dogs and cornbread.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#11:1> Secondly, I would not let my churning guts reflect in any of my

facial expressions.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#12:1> People here think of me as eccentric, and this was not the time to

appear as such.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#13:1> I didn't want my dream about Ned to sound like the most crazy and

ostentatious, <foreign> <it> deus-ex-machina </it> </foreign> of dreams that

this fella ever heard.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#14:1> I needed the sergeant's help, so I wanted the dream to sound as

truthful as I knew it to be.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#15:1> Why was I so sure?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#16:1> Well, there are just some things a body knows. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#17:1> You see, my momma was pregnant with me when she was struck by

lightning.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#18:1> She, and by extension myself, had leaned over to pick up a basket of

laundry when the lightning hit.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#19:1> My daddy looked out from the kitchen window just in time to see a

skinny, jagged line of light dive right at Momma's back.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#20:1> She went stomach first into the laundry basket.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#21:1> Luckily, the basket wasn't completely full and there was room for me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#22:1> I was born with a slight head tremor, which since Ned has been

missing has become as vigorous as a stripper's shimmy dance.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#23:1> But let me tell you, not all of that chance lightning-strike was bad.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#24:1> There is nothing I can prove, but I've always had a notion that as I

lay in my momma's womb I was as unwritten upon as a tiny <foreign> <it>

tabula rasa </it> </foreign> until Kablam! – the lightning hit and cursed /

blessed me with my tremor, my assorted creative tal <l> ents, and my name,

Jubilee Hightower.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#25:1> My daddy was so glad to have my momma and me escape death, he named

me Jubilee.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#26:1> It is a name I've had to live up to or live down, depending on which

time or place in my life journey we're speaking of.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#27:1> But I also believe the lightning flash out of the blue gave me my

on-again, off-again clairvoyance.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#28:1> If you've ever experienced clairvoyance yourself, you'll know it can

work at both significant and silly moments.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#29:1> You might suddenly know where your lost hanky is at, or you might

suddenly know your friend in Sarajevo has been hit by a bullet.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#30:1> So that is how I know this dream about Ned is true.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#31:1> Now if you're a sceptic you'll say I'm crazy, but, in fact, that

dream is a big chunk of the story of how I got all the way from Texas to

Toronto, and why I'm on this bus with you to Algonquin Park, which is what

you asked me about in the first place. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#32:1> As I said, everything depended on Sergeant McRoberts believing

what I had to tell him about my dream, but I felt scattered, heart-sore, and

completely alone, and so far all I had managed to do was answer questions

that were in my head rather than the ones the sergeant was asking.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#33:1> As you might expect, he had his own agenda and his own order in which

he wanted to receive information from me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#34:1> Well, did I filibuster his bill! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#35:1> He asked my husband's name. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#36:1> I told him what time Ned had left on Friday and repeated it was

now Monday and he was a day late. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#37:1> He asked Ned's age. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#38:1> I told him he was forty-five, but I expected we'd all be a lot

older before I could get anyone to look for him, and that I couldn't

understand why the Park Rangers would want to wait a day before they searched

for him just because there had been a thunderstorm; a thunderstorm does not

prevent you from leaving a place when you know there are people waiting for

and worrying about you – unless you're in trouble! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#39:1> The sergeant asked Ned's occupation, but I had the need just

then, as if Ned had suddenly swept through the doors of that police station

and given me one of his great big bear hugs, to tell about how Ned and I met

at a party so long ago at the Alpha Epsilon fraternity house at William Smith

and Hobart College in Geneva, New York, on the self-polluting but still

beautiful Lake Seneca.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#40:1> I told the sergeant, who by now looked helpless to stop me, that I

had noticed Ned at the party because in the heated debate that was going on

among the six or seven of us, Ned said nothing.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#41:1> Ned looked like Grizzly Adams – a gentle face, covered by a ferocious

blond beard.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#42:1> And he had draped his big body in a chair by a window that looked out

on the lake.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#43:1> Ned was not looking at the view, but rather watching the cooing and

peck <l> ing pigeons on the window's ledge.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#44:1> Well, believe it or not we were all sober, and believe it or not the

rest of us were not discussing the Vietnam War, but rather the merits of the

opposing philosophies of Heraclitus and Parmenides.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#45:1> Was the world a fire-born cauldron of change, or was change mere

illusion, the false opinion of the senses in a world unified and immutable?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#46:1> It was the usual group dynamic – the boys in the group were showing

off mostly to each other, while the girls, every once in a while, made an

attempt to get a word in edgewise.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#47:1> The argument went back and forth, people taking various positions in

or outside the cauldron, until there was a natural apoca <l> lyptic pause in

the conversation.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#48:1> Ned finally spoke from the corner, " Do you think pigeons poo on

people on purpose?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#49:1> I could see Ned was a man who kept to the particular.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#50:1> That aroused my interest.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#51:1> I went over to the window and sat down in the chair opposite.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#52:1> He looked at me as if he had been expecting me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#53:1> Ned's quietness was for me like a cool Lone Star beer on a hot day.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#54:1> When we graduated, I was happy to go to Canada with him because I was

on my way north anyway. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#55:1> Since you're an American, you've probably heard that everyone in

a small town in Texas wants to leave because they think it's better or

different somewhere else, especially a little <it> girl </it> in Texas.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#56:1> In high school, permissible activities for girls were two: getting

straight A's and showing their panties cheerleading.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#57:1> Well, I did that, and then I wanted to do something else. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#58:1> I could paint, and I could make things.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#59:1> Even though everyone knew my daddy was a carpenter, people begrudged

me my chisel, my saw, my hammer, and my nails.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#60:1> They did not like a twelve-year-old girl making a tree house in her

front yard where everyone could see.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#61:1> It just wasn't ladylike.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#62:1> Well it is no Texas brag to say it was the best and the biggest tree

house in the U.S. of A.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#63:1> It had two secret compartments and eight hinged doors.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#64:1> But never mind its fine quality, what mattered to our neighbors was

that little girls should not make treehouses. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#65:1> So I went to the northeast to college where I found out people

don't like pretty and smart young women to express themselves there either.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#66:1> That's where I picked up my from-nowhere-in-particu <l> lar voice —

not on purpose, and not because some well-meaning but prejudiced Yankee

friend said people would take me more seri <l> ously if I dropped my drawl.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#67:1> I picked it up mostly by osmosis and because of the weather.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#68:1> Your words get sawed off real quick when freezing rain is slapping

your face. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#69:1> Well anyway, I could see Sergeant McRoberts was torn between

compassion for my plight, and wanting to wring my neck.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#70:1> Of course, he was too polite to wring my neck.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#71:1> Canadians are as a rule very polite.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#72:1> They almost never poo on you on purpose. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#73:1> After I had related how Ned and I met, Sergeant McRoberts asked

me, " Did Ned have any companions?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#74:1> " Oh, he has some friends," I said, and the sergeant raised his

pencil, " but his veterinary practice keeps him very busy.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#75:1> Ned is one of those people who has as much rapport with animals as

with peo <l> ple.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#76:1> Our English-setter Chauncey is devoted to Ned.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#77:1> The two of them won the Canadian Dog and Master Frisbee Championships

this year.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#78:1> And Ned is fascinated by bears.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#79:1> That's why he loves camp <l> ing.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#80:1> He is fascinated by everything about bears — their massive size,

their hibernation patterns, and also the deadly finality of their cor <l>

ruption by humans with our easy, ready-made food.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#81:1> Did you know bears who have tasted Doritos are unable to go back to

the wild?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#82:1> At this point, the sergeant thrust himself back in his chair, and

drew his large hand slowly over his clean-shaven face, an action which

released the very loud cologne he was wearing.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#83:1> " I meant," he said, barely hanging onto his patience, " how many

were in Ned's camping group?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#84:1> " Oh.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#85:1> He was alone.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#86:1> I was supposed to go with him, but they moved up the date of my show

at the McMichael Art Gallery, so I couldn't go."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#87:1> My eyes began to tear at this point as much from the sergeant's

cologne as from my dread guilt about Ned.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#88:1> Maybe if I had gone with Ned, I could somehow have prevented all

this. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#89:1> Of course, I didn't tell Sergeant McRoberts I had to be at the

gallery because they were showing " Sunny Pyromania," my diorama of the wife

of the first Governor of Upper Canada, Elizabeth Gwillim Simcoe, setting fire

to the Ontario woods.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#90:1> I, as the perfor <l> mance artist, had to be there to set the fire.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#91:1> Oh, don't worry, the fires of my display were all controlled.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#92:1> But you can bet I didn't mention my interest in Elizabeth Simcoe's

pyromania to Sergeant McRoberts.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#93:1> And I was right because the next thing I know, the sergeant is

implying Ned meant to get lost.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#94:1> He asked me how well we got along and if I remembered had we had a

bit of a tiff before he left.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#95:1> <it> Bit-of-a-tiff </it> reminded me how far I was from Texas. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#96:1> " No, we never had a bit of a tiff in our whole married life.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#97:1> If I thought Ned had a liking for tiny, whiny tiffs, I would not have

married him." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#98:1> Of course, I didn't tell the sergeant about the very healthy <}>

<-> <w> hol <l> lerin' </w> </-> <+> hol <l> lering </+> </}> matches we've

had.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#99:1> I had to teach Ned how to do this because he was from a family who

never had any disagreements that even came close to qualifying as a tiff.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#100:1> There was very little observable range of emotion at any time on any

one of their pale faces.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#101:1> And the emotional elephants that were born, grew up, and swayed

silently in the middle of their living room over the years out <l> weighed

all the elephants on the vast and unfathomable continent of Africa. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-020#102:1> This, by the way, is one reason why the idea that Ned may have

disappeared on purpose took me completely by surprise.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#103:1> You see, I always thought that I, if anyone, would be the one to

wander off, because despite the beauty of Ontario's rolling green hills, the

area is in many ways an inhospitable place for a girl from Texas to live.

</I> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-020#X104:1> You might not realize that, this being your first trip to Ontario.
