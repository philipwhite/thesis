<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-043#1:1:A> It wasn't a <,,> big deal

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-043#2:1:B> Hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-043#3:1:A> Uhm <,,> when I was in grade one <}> <-> we had </-> <=> we all

had </=> </}> to go to the high school
<ICE-CAN:S1A-043#4:1:A> This is quite a traumatic event
<ICE-CAN:S1A-043#5:1:A> We all had to go to the high school to see a film <,> and I had

never seen television before
<ICE-CAN:S1A-043#6:1:A> <{> <[> And the film </[> was on a huge screen

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-043#7:1:B> <[> How old were you </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-043#8:1:A> Grade one
<ICE-CAN:S1A-043#9:1:A> <{> <[> We were </[> six years old

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-043#11:1:A> And <,> it showed <,> some children on a train track and the

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-043#12:1:B> <[> Eww </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-043#16:1:A> Now that was to keep us away from the train tracks

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-043#17:1:B> It was really tempting to go
<ICE-CAN:S1A-043#18:1:B> Cos you'd have to wait sometimes

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-043#23:1:A> Mhh hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-043#24:1:B> So actually the property values were less on that side of the

tracks

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-043#25:1:A> Wow

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-043#26:1:B> Because the <?> Wardass </?> tracks went right across and ah

<ICE-CAN:S1A-043#96:1:A> The police came to our house to investigate how this rope had been

cut and they all said they hadn't done it

<ICE-CAN:S1A-043#98:1:A> They were <,> about twelve years old

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-043#109:1:B> Ohh I see

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-043#110:1:A> But uh I think they just received a slap on the wrist as if
