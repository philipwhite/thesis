<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#2:1:B> Beautiful morning out there isn't it <{> <[> right now </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#3:1:A> <[> isn't it glorious </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#4:1:A> It's that red red sky

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#5:1:B> yes

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#6:1:B> Yeah uh we got a beautiful cityscape on our ah traffic monitor

right <{1> <[1> now </[1> which isn't <}> <-> s </-> <=> showing </=> </}>

traffic
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#7:1:B> But that's no problem because there's no traffic to show really
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#8:1:B> <{2> <[2> to speak of </[2> <O> laugh </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#9:1:A> <[1> Mhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#10:1:A> <[2> Fine then we'll take the pleasant city view yeah </[2>

</{2> <,> </I>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#11:1:B> All the routes into town working very well right now
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#12:1:B> From the West Island Southshore and Laval
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#13:1:B> Ah no delays accidents stalled cars to report on the Metropolitan

or C&ocircumflex;te de Liesse or D&eacute;carie expressway
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#14:1:B> just ah one thing off Island down the uh Jean-Lesage autoroute

again
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#15:1:B> Unfortunately uh this not quite so serious an accident as we <}>

<-> <.> re </.> </-> <=> reported </=> </}> yesterday <,> and it's also a bit

closer to Montreal at <indig> Sainte-Rosalie </indig> which is about one

hundred and forty kilometres east of Montreal uh
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#16:1:B> A two car accident there and apparently <,> one injury <,> but

again not as serious as the other one that we reported yesterday <{1> <[1>

also <}> <-> it is uh </-> <=> these things </=> </}> seem to come <}> <-> in

</-> <=> in </=> </}> </[1>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#17:1:B> <{2> <[2> batches like this </[2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#18:1:A> <[1> it's odd though two days in a row I mean you rarely uh

</[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#19:1:A> <[2> waves yeah </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#20:1:B> Uh when we had problems <}> <-> oh </-> <=> on </=> </}> the

island of Montreal uh uh on the
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#21:1:B> <{1> <[1> twenty again at Woodland </[1> </{1> <}> <-> they </->

<=> they </=> </}> came in a batch and so uh it's just the way things work it

seems
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#22:1:B> <{2> <[2> so </[2> well let's hope <}> <-> that the uh </-> <=> if

there is a problem there will be <}> <-> <.> co </.> </-> <=> corrected </=>

<}> </=> </}>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#23:1:A> <[1> same <unclear> word </unclear> mmm yeah </[1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#24:1:A> <[2> we'll hope this is the last of <?> many </?> </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#25:1:B> There is a lot of construction going on on the uh Jean-Lesage

autoroute
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#26:1:B> <{1> <[1> these days </[1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#27:1:A> <[1> mhm </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#28:1:B> In fact in Sainte-Rosalie we had one lane closed yesterday I

don't know if it was closed overnight or not
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#29:1:B> I'll check into that
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#30:1:B> <{1> <[1> <,> so </[1> people might <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to

</+> </}> watch it if they're heading out today

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#31:1:A> <[1> yeah that might cause confusion </[1> </{1> </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#32:2:A> Now is that your theme music <@> Jeanne </@>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#33:2:A> <{1> <[1> The leafing through the paper music </[1>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#34:2:A> <{2> <[2> Mhm </[2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#35:2:B> <[1> I don't know it's very uhm courtly I guess </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#36:2:B> <[2> <}> <-> I </-> <=> it </=> </}> would be </[2> </{2> <{3>

<[3> suitable </[3>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#37:2:B> I <{4> <[4> guess </[4>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#38:2:B> Except that this morning I wanted to open with a sports story <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#39:2:B> <{5> <[5> uhm </[5>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#40:2:B> <}> <-> So I guess it's not directly <,> </-> <=> I guess you

couldn't say that </=> </}> <{6> <[6> <unclear> word </unclear> </[6> <?> not

really the adequate scene </?> for that

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#41:2:B> but anyway it's uhm again the story of Bruny Surin and Donovan

Bailey and it's the lead story in <indig> La Presse </indig> <&> local

newspaper </&> with a big photograph of the two guys smiling
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#42:2:B> <{7> <[7> <}> <-> from <.> mi </.> </-> </[7> <=> you know from

</=> </}> <,> ear to ear and <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> lead is uh is

<quote> <indig> ils s'entendent <}> <-> comme la </-> <=> comme des larrons

en foire </=> </}> </indig> </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#43:2:B> Now the word <indig> larrons </indig> I had to go and consult with

our French colleagues
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#44:2:B> <{8> <[8> It's </[8> a kind of an uh a mediaeval term meaning uh

something like the court jester
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#45:2:B> <{9> <[9> So </[9> these two guys clearly are having a great time
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#46:2:B> That's what the <indig> La Presse </indig> is suggesting
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#47:2:B> It says that they're friendly rivals who are proud to be the first

<,> double Canadian winners in Track <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#48:2:B> <{10> <[10> and </[10> that they had two golds in the Swedish

competition to prove that they're the best in the world and to put the ghost

of Ben Johnson to rest <{11> <[11> <,> </[11>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#49:2:B> That's a ghost that's been hanging around since nineteen

eighty-eight
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#50:2:B> And ah they're very much enjoying being treated like international

stars in Sweden

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#51:2:A> <[3> Mmm mmm </[3> </{3>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#52:2:A> <[4> It's lively it's lively </[4> </{4>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#53:2:A> <[5> Mhm </[5> </{5>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#54:2:A> <[6> Not a natural link no </[6> </{6>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#55:2:A> <[7> <.> <?> Beau- </?> </.> </[7> </{7>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#56:2:A> <[8> Mmm </[8> </{8>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#57:2:A> <[9> Oh </[9> </{9>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#58:2:A> <[10> Mhm </[10> </{10>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#59:2:A> <[11> Mhm </[11> </{11>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#60:2:A> Ah well they really do look like they're glowing
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#61:2:A> It's funny yesterday there was some comment from another athlete

who said <quote> you know I'm sure Bruny isn't too disappointed </quote> and

I thought <?> yeah <?> I didn't see <{1> <[1> disappointment exactly </[1>

<O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#62:2:A> <{2> <[2> <unclear> word </unclear> pretty <?> enjoyable </?> all

round </[2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#63:2:B> <[1> No <unclear> word </unclear> looked pretty happy </[1>

</{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#64:2:B> <[2> Yeah I think he's really enjoying being <}> <-> the </->

<=> the </=> </}> centre of attention over there </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#65:2:B> Uhm in the Gazette and the Globe as well as on the front page

of <indig> Le Devoir </indig> <&> local newspapers </&> the uh the story of

the Serb <,> <{1> <[1> refugees </[1> in the Krajina ah
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#66:2:B> And the
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#67:2:B> <{2> <[2> number being quoted </[2> is a hundred and <{3> <[3>

twenty thousand </[3> <,> in the Gazette

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#68:2:A> <[1> Hmm </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#69:2:A> <[2> Next wave </[2> </{2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#70:2:A> <[3> Gee hmm </[3> </{3>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#71:2:B> Ah Croatia says its three day military operation to take over

the Krajina <,> is over <,> and they will now clear out ah the five thousand

Serb rebels left
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#72:2:B> Ah <}> <-> this the ah </-> <=> this is an </=> </}> attack that

shocked the world
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#73:2:B> The Croatian army ah you know unexpectedly well-prepared and ah <,>

aggressive here
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#74:2:B> And ah there are reports of attacks on Serb refugees by Croat

troops <,> according to the International Committee of the Red Cross
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#75:2:B> And looting of towns
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#76:2:B> So <}> <-> it </-> <=> it's </=> </}> really a conflict in which

there don't seem to be any good guys
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#77:2:B> Ah it's very hard to ah to understand

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#78:2:A> That's just it even ah as you look at the different sides
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#79:2:A> And I think that's what's so discouraging about it is <{> <[> uh

<,> </[> no lines drawn

<$B> <[> <}> <-> No there's no </-> <=> no one has the moral high road on

this one </=> </}> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#80:2:A> No no

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#81:2:B> Ah in <indig> Le Devoir </indig> the lead story
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#82:2:B> Quebec's youngest politician Mario Dumont twenty-five years old on

the pre-referendum campaign trail and he's sort of on the damage control

trail I guess you could say <}> <-> The lead </-> <=> the title </=> </}> is

<quote> Dumont will respect the <}> <-> <.> tra- </.> </-> <=> tripartite

</=> </}> agreement </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#83:2:B> this is an agreement that was arrived at in June between the Bloc

Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois, the P Q and Dumont's Action d&eacute;mocratique <&>

political parties in Quebec </&>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#84:2:B> And last week he got himself into a bit of hot water when he told

<indig> Le Devoir </indig> he was uneasy about the proposed bill <{> <[> that

the P Q has put forward </[> that would declare Quebec sovereign
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#85:2:B> He wants a vote on sovereignty specifically and wants a negotiating

committee that would include federalists on it and this was very upsetting to

uh Montreal P Q activists some of whom threatened to resign
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#86:2:B> Uhm so uh he's <}> <-> hel </-> <=> called </=> </}> a <?> newser

</?> to clarify this and he said that he'd like Parizeau to modify the

proposed bill <,> to include the terms of the June agreement and he wants a

sovereignty partnership with Canada &aacute; la Bourassa
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#87:2:B> <?> Just </?> so funny about Dumont <.> i </.> the photo of him on

the back page of the front section of the <indig> Devoir </indig>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#88:2:B> He looks like Bourassa <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#89:2:B> <{1> <[1> <}> <-> He even <.> st </.> </-> </[1> <=> he's even

standing </=> </}> there with <}> <-> his </-> <=> the </=> </}> tips
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#90:2:B> <{2> <[2> of his fingers together </[2>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#91:2:B> <,> it's quite hilarious <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> must say

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#92:2:B> <{3> <[3> anyway </[3> so uh
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#93:2:B> <}> <-> He </-> <=> well </=> </}> definitely <,> a follower

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#94:2:A> <[> Hmm mm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#95:2:A> <[1> Oh </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#96:2:A> <[2> He <unclear> words </unclear> mannerisms that's right

</[2> </{2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#97:2:A> <[3> Yeah <,> he seems a student of his </[3> </{3>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#98:2:A> But yeah ah week by week uhm <}> <-> i- </-> <=> it's </=>

</}> back and forth with him certainly isn't it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#99:2:A> Uh the signing there <}> <-> <.> wa- </.> </-> <=> wasn't </=> </}>

uh a word mentioned of <}> <-> any </-> <=> any </=> </}> kind of uhm

problems with whatever he was signing on for and then suddenly <{> <[> a

little distance from it </[> and now <quote> no no it'll be fine <,> it's

just a few changes </quote>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#100:2:B> <[> He's having reservations <,> yes yeah </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#101:2:B> And the reaction of the media to this whole thing is

interesting
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#102:2:B> It's the top of the <?> full story </?> in <indig> Le Devoir

</indig>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#103:2:B> It's not mentioned in <indig> La Presse </indig> and it's buried

in The Gazette <{> <[> <O> laugh </O> so </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#104:2:A> <[> Oh yeah way deep in a tiny little mention </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#119:2:A> Hmm mmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#120:2:B> In <indig> La Presse </indig> an exclusive story concerning

Haiti <,> a country we haven't heard too much about in the news in the last

week or two
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#121:2:B> Bishop Willy Rom&eacute;luse of J&eacute;r&eacute;mie which is on

the far western part of the island uhm
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#122:2:B> And also <}> <-> this </-> <=> uh this </=> </}> was a person who

<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#127:2:B> He also opposed the Vatican which recognized the government of

C&eacute;dras
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#128:2:B> A very courageous man
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#129:2:B> And he's not officially being received by the Quebec church but

only uh by the Haitian community
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#130:2:B> And of course there are forty thousand Haitian Quebecers here in

Montreal
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#131:2:B> So interesting story that no one else picked up on
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#132:2:B> In <indig> Le Devoir </indig> a review of the uh <indig>

Francofolie </indig> Festival again

<quote> unorthodox </quote> <indig> Francofolie </indig> Festival
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#134:2:B> He says the <indig> Conseille de la langue fran&ccedille;aise

</indig> <&> French language promotion council </&> is nowhere to be seen <,>

and uh this is a good thing
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#135:2:B> And he talks about <unclear> word </unclear> a sixty-three

j'ai le droit </indig> </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#136:2:B> He asked permission to sing in English

sarcastically
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#138:2:B> And he went ahead and sang <quote> Blowing in the Wind </quote> in

English
<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#139:2:B> And uhm <}> <-> <indig> Le Devoir </indig> </-> <=> this reveiwer

<ICE-CAN:S1B-021#140:2:B> There's uh Kashtin singing in Montagnais <,> there's Afiletta

singing in Corsican <,> and he's happy to see this mixture of language and

cultures

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#141:2:A> Something of an evolution for the Francofolie then

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-021#142:2:B> New and different and very happy about that
