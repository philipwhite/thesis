<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#1:1:Z> <O> introduction </O> <O> Audience claps </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#2:1:A> Now I don't know why the hell I'm here
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#3:1:A> We can forget <,,> culture as a resource
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#4:1:A> Not really <,,> <O> audience laughs </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#5:1:A> Cos I'm a writer

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#6:1:A> I create <,> illusory people <,> and I uh
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#7:1:A> Writers're often asked uh <,> what do you do with a novel
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#8:1:A> Do you blueprint it do you block it out and plot it and then do it

over <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#9:1:A> Well <,> you don't
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#10:1:A> What you do <,,> with <,> your <,> illusory people is you find <}>

<-> em </-> <+> them </+> </}> first <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#11:1:A> <}> <-> They </-> <=> You </=> </}> find them you prospect for them
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#12:1:A> This is where the business of culture or arts as a resource <,>

comes in <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#13:1:A> Uh <,> you find them in your own stored <,> actual past <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#14:1:A> But very soon after finding these life models you <}> <-> gotta

</-> <+> got to </+> </}> take a creative leap <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#15:1:A> Indeed <}> <-> I'm </-> <=> my </=> </}> second <,> son read in

Since Daisy Creek uh <,> I <}> <-> kinda </-> <+> kind of </+> </}> got

corrupted over the years and there's an explicit sex scene in that <,> novel

<O> audience laughs </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#16:1:A> Takes place with a professor in a University on a bed of

mid-term papers <O> audience laughs </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#17:1:A> When I finished it I uh <,> said to my son who knows how I

teach creative writing <,> and that you must work out <?> about </?> a

biography <,> and knew about it he said geez dad I hope that was a creative

leap <O> audience laughs </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#18:1:A> I said it sure as hell was Hewey
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#19:1:A> It's the biggest creative leap I've ever taken <O> audience laughs

</O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#20:1:A> But you take this creative leap <,> and <}> <-> you have to

</-> <=> even though your people have become fictional and the events unreal

<,,> you have to </=> </}> believe <,,> these unreal <,> people <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#21:1:A> Because to a certain extent <}> <-> they dicterate </-> <,> <=>

they dictate </=> </}> what is going to happen <,> in your fiction
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#22:1:A> Now this isn't a healthy thing to do every day <,> uh <,> every

month <,> every year <O> audience laughs </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#23:1:A> Uh <,> uh not only that as <,> like many psychologists with

their real people <,,> mine are almost always in trouble <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#24:1:A> Uh I'm concerned with them in those times when life has become

incandescent with stress with conflict <,> uh <,> love hate greed <,>

generosity pride snobbery birth death marriage divorce success failure <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#25:1:A> Now neither life nor art which is an illusion of life are simple
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#26:1:A> It's not either or
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#27:1:A> It's accord of <,> comic and tragic
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#28:1:A> Bad writing is either slapstick farce or it's melodrama <,> or it's

opera <,> and I won't go into that <?> then </?> <O> audience laughs </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#29:1:A> My wife <,> has <.> p </.> a sense of perfect pitch
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#30:1:A> She thinks opera is wonderful but it does <?> show to </?> the

worst writing ever done by man <O> audience laughs </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#31:1:A> Now <,> a famous Canadian Doctor Wilder Penfield <,> <}> <->

searching </-> <,> <=> was searching </=> </}> for an explanation of epilepsy
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#32:1:A> His sister <}> <-> had <,> been </-> <=> had suffered </=> </}>

from it
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#33:1:A> And at the Montreal Neurological Institute <,> <}> <-> he was </->

<,> <=> he had </=> </}> a patient <,> she was fully conscious <,> and he had

an electric stimulator probe <}> <-> and </-> <,> <=> and </=> </}> was <}>

<-> touching </-> uh <=> stimulating </=> </}> certain <,> parts of the

cortex <,> trying to find <,> uhm <,> a growth uh uh an injury something that

would explain the seizures
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#34:1:A> While he was doing this <,> she heard somebody singing <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#35:1:A> She recognized the tune <,> she recognized the lyrics <,> and it

was her mother's voice
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#36:1:A> And as well the recall experience was in detailed and total context

<,> emotionally <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#37:1:A> They established that she couldn't even have been three years old

at that time
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#38:1:A> That's when he stumbled across <,> the <,> fact <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#39:1:A> <}> <-> <.> Th </.> </-> <=> This </=> </}> started the idea of the

bicameral brain <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#40:1:A> And it gives new importance to the caves of the subconscious where

each human has stored <,> a unique and individual <,> past <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#41:1:A> And we know that <,> thanks to Wilder Penfield that nothing which

bombards a human brain is ever lost
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#42:1:A> It may be forgotten but it's not
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#43:1:A> Now <,> that's the resource <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#44:1:A> That's the unrefined resource
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#45:1:A> It's called life <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#46:1:A> It's <,> smells sights sounds touches <,> bits of people <,>

emotions <,> and you've got to prospect <,> that <,> stored <}> <-> <.> re

</.> </-> <,> <+> resource </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#47:1:A> So I'm not too far <,> off <,> the thing here <,> because the

important thing about that art resource for a <,> writer <,> of short stories

plays poems novels <,> there's an important geographic dimension <,> to it
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#48:1:A> And that dimension has its effect during the litmus years of

childhood when somebody is stained
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#49:1:A> So boy if you're north of the forty-ninth parallel <,> and I'm not

far north during those <,> affecting years for me <,> when I built up my

resources out of which I might <,> refine <,> uh I'm not a practicing poet

but plays novels short stories
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#50:1:A> Now <,> as a child <,> for the first twelve years I wandered over

the prairie a great deal <,,> with the prairie wind dirging for me through

the great prairie harp <,> of telephone wires <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#51:1:A> They hummed <,> they twanged and they seemed to endlessly adjust

themselves against <,> the prairie stillness
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#52:1:A> I can remember barbed wire fences <,> and impaled on the barbs were

butterflies <,> grasshoppers <,> earthworms <,> maybe field mice
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#53:1:A> It was the shrike's supermarket <&> shrike is a type of bird </&>

<O> audience laughs </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#54:1:A> <}> <-> And in the winter </-> <=> And earlier than that </=>

</}> they did it on the <,> buffalo berry bushes with those sharp thorns
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#55:1:A> And in the winter <,> I could <.> f </.> read bird prints on the

snow <,> the alternating dog tracks of a coyote <,> or the domino ones of

jackrabbits <,> and they all signalled animal life to me not human life
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#56:1:A> Again and again <,> the skipping lift of a prairie meadowlark's

song surprised me <,> and in my new world at a very young age I learned I was

mortal
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#57:1:A> I could die <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#58:1:A> The end of Billy Mitchell
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#59:1:A> That's probably the biggest thing I uncovered in the way <,> of <,>

an art <,> resource <,> for me
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#60:1:A> Now <,> when you learn you're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+>

</}> die you truly understand you're human
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#61:1:A> You've been then given a perspective which is very helpful in

deciding what is important <,> and what is unimportant what is valuable and

what is not valuable
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#62:1:A> A sense of one's own mortality does clarify priorities
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#63:1:A> The Greek <,> not the one who had the commercial <{> <[> <?> Cafe

in Wayburn </?> </[> another one named <.> Soc </.> <,> Socrates <,,> said

that the unexamined life isn't worth living

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#64:1:Z> <[> <O> audience laughs </O> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#65:1:A> Now there's an old prairie expression and I think it's still

valid for the north and for <,> Fort MacMurray <,> I'm sure
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#66:1:A> Says much the same thing <,> don't you eat that there stuff Elmer

<,> it's horseshit <O> Audience laughs </O> <O> Audience claps </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#67:1:A> The point is <,> in your conference here <,> Challenge North

<,> man doesn't live by reason and common sense alone
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#68:1:A> The simply intellectual life <,> is not worth living either <,> and

the most valuable resource a nation has <,> is that one uncovered <,> by

Wilder Penfield when he worked with the epileptic patient <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#69:1:A> You see art is the only thing humans do for its own sake <,> uh

besides the act of love <O> audience laughs </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#70:1:A> This explains perhaps the <,> great part that the arts play in

culture
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#71:1:A> Humans are the only animals who make poems plays novels drama
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#72:1:A> They are the only animals who paint dance sing sculpt compose
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#73:1:A> Artists philosophers historians research scientists <,,> they know

<,> that man is a finite warm sack of vulnerability
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#74:1:A> Because of this <,> knowledge <,> they have an <}> <-> affair </->

<=> unfair </=> </}> advantage <,> over politicians <,> and generals <,> and

quarterbacks <,> and the heads of <,> Dow <,> United Fruit <,> Hooker

Chemicals <&> audience laughs several times during pauses </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#75:1:A> Cos see art's the only thing man does for its own sake
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#76:1:A> It doesn't involve an adversary relationship <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#77:1:A> There are no winners over losers no victors over vanquished <,>

Soviet over American <,> toreador over bull
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#78:1:A> Creative partners to artists who look and wonder at a painting or a

play or a ballet <,> or who listen to a symphony <,> and since Myrna isn't

here even opera <{> <[> <,> </[> don't take anything from the artist

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#79:1:Z> <[> <O> audience laughs </O> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#80:1:A> The book isn't taken from the author both partner and artist

win <,> through shared pity and terror <,> compassion and empathy <,>

laughter <,> and tears <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#81:1:A> Death and solitude justify art
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#82:1:A> They make it important <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#83:1:A> Which draws human aliens together in the mortal family and unites

them against the heart of darkness
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#84:1:A> Humans must comfort each other defend each other against the terror

of being human <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#85:1:A> There's a civilized accountability to others
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#86:1:A> The coyote <,> the jackrabbit and the badger and the killdeer and

the weasel <,> they don't have it
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#87:1:A> Okay <,> so this is Challenge North
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#88:1:A> So I <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> share with you <,> a

refined thing that came out of the autobiographical <,> that I prospected my

stored past of smells sights sounds tastes touches <,> feelings <,> and took

a creative leap
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#89:1:A> Very frequently <,> it isn't a very large leap
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#90:1:A> It stays very close to the unrefined resource
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#91:1:A> Now let's refine <,> a little bit further from a autobiography
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#92:1:A> It's from a novel called How I Spent My Summer Holidays </I>


<I>

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#93:2:Z> <O> introduction </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-028#94:2:A> When you look at us as a biologist does we're not very

impressive
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#95:2:A> We're not very fast <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#96:2:A> <}> <-> The uh </-> <,> <=> Any </=> </}> elephant can outrun the

fastest human being on earth
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#97:2:A> We're not exceptionally strong <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#98:2:A> We're not gifted with special sensory <}> <-> aculit </-> <=>

acuity </=> </}> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#99:2:A> We're not uh gifted <}> <-> with <.> i </.> </-> <=> with any </=>

</}> <unclear> word </unclear> and yet <,> we have become the dominant

species on this planet
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#100:2:A> The most numerous mammal <,> on earth <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#101:2:A> Our major survival trait of course <,> is a huge and complex brain

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#102:2:A> A brain that enabled us to recognize patterns in nature <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#103:2:A> Things like the <,> regularity of the tides of the seasons of

animal migration plant succession
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#104:2:A> As Fran&ccedilla;ois Jacob has said <,,> <quote> the human brain

has a built-in need for order </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#105:2:A> And by creating order <,> out of chaos <,> we were able to uh

anticipate events and to exploit that anticipation <,> <}> <-> by uh <.> wi

</.> </-> <=> through </=> </}> our predictive capacities for our greater

survival <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#106:2:A> Thus <,> from that human brain emerged the concept <,> of <,>

future
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#107:2:A> Of course the future doesn't exist it's not real <,> it only

exists <,> as an invention of the human brain
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#108:2:A> But because we invented an idea like a future <,> it gifted us as

no other animal has on this planet <,> with choice
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#109:2:A> We can deliberately choose <,> from a variety of options and

thereby plot our way into a number of different kinds of futures
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#110:2:A> And for ninety-nine percent of our existence on earth that

strategy worked
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#111:2:A> <,> We were able to flourish <,> and yet at the same time nature

<,> seemed <,> infinitely abundant <,> and endlessly self-renewing <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#112:2:A> Today <,> we can see before our eyes that nature is no longer as

vast as it <.> alway </.> <&> tape cuts out briefly </&> nor is it as

resilient <,> as it has been in the past <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#113:2:A> Yet today with all of the amplified brain power of <,> global

telecommunications with computers with scientists and engineers <,> we no

longer seem able to do what our ancestors did
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#114:2:A> To act deliberately by choosing an option that would give us the

highest survival attribute <,> or possibility
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#115:2:A> And the question that we have to ask ourselves is why
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#116:2:A> Why do we seem so paralyzed <,> today
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#117:2:A> I've already participated in two days of <,> preliminary

discussions here at Global Forum <,> and I'm afraid that <,> it's clear that

we still haven't established a discussion that deals with the fundamental

context <,> within which we can assess <,> the human place in the planetary

ecosphere
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#118:2:A> We are still so caught up in <.> hu </.> <&> tape cuts out briefly

</&> that we fail to recognize our absolute needs <,> as biological beings

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#119:2:A> In the discussions that I've heard about the north versus the

south <,> in the need for greater input from women <,> from youth <,> from

the handicapped and indigenous people <,> there is little acknowledgement

first of all that we are part of the web of life <,> that contains perhaps

thirty million <,> other species <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#120:2:A> We are above all human animals <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#121:2:A> As dependent on air water soil and biological diversity as any

other living things
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#122:2:A> These life support systems <,> air water soil and biodiversity <,>

are what make our societies possible
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#123:2:A> But today they are being torn apart by human numbers <,> by

poverty and technological muscle power
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#124:2:A> Science can not begin to comprehend the vast diversity of living

organisms on earth and their interactions with each other <,> and the

physical properties of the world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#125:2:A> Yet we hack away at nature <,> as if it is infinitely renewable
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#126:2:A> And we pour our industrial excreta into life support systems <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#127:2:A> As if somehow <,> air water soil <,> can absorb <,> dilute and

detoxify these poisons indefinitely
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#128:2:A> We know for a fact <,> that human activity is now creating change

on a global scale that is unprecedented in scope <,> and speed <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#129:2:A> Our species <,> is now increasing in numbers at the rate of three

people a second and that rate <,> is itself accelerating
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#130:2:A> Agricultural topsoil is being degraded <,> at the rate of

twenty-five billion tonnes a year
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#131:2:A> And global food production <,> can not be substantially increased

by any of the <}> <-> <.> de </.> </-> <=> advances </=> </}> in

biotechnology
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#132:2:A> Industrial toxins many of them novel <,> and hence

nonbiodegradable <,> are being poured into air water and soil <,> at

horrifying rates
<ICE-CAN:S2B-028#133:2:A> In the United States alone over two billion kilograms a year <&>

tape cuts out briefly </&> air water and soil </I>
