<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#2:1:A> Metropolitan westbound that stalled car at Stinson's now gone
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#3:1:A> Now we have a stalled truck in the right-hand lane at L'Acadie

slowing things there
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#4:1:A> Also report of an accident in Repentigny on the Forty eastbound

across the Benjamin-Moreau bridge
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#5:1:A> And coming in from the Southshore we're up to a five to eight minute

delay at the Mercier bridge </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-010#6:2:A> Uh right now a minor problem Met westbound a stalled car in the

right-hand lane at uh Stinson
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#7:2:A> The Metropolitan eastbound working well especially through

D&eacute;carie circle </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-010#8:3:A> Now a trade in the C F L to talk about in which the Toronto

Argonauts and Ottawa Roughriders swapped kickers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#9:3:A> The Argos sending their kicker Wayne Lammle along with linebacker

Chris Tsangaris and guard Mike Jovanovich to the Riders
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#10:3:A> In return they get kicker Terry Baker guard Scott Douglas and

future considerations
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#11:3:A> Meantime Ottawa also sent quarterback Shawn Moore to the Winnipeg

Blue Bombers as part of the Sammy Garza deal
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#12:3:A> Well a discipline hearing against Alan Eagleson begins today in

Toronto <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#13:3:A> A group that regulates lawyers in Ontario filed a complaint against

the former hockey czar last November
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#14:3:A> The law society of Upper Canada's complaints center around <,> a

period of twenty years when Eagleson was considered the most powerful man in

hockey <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#15:3:A> He was the head of the N H L Players Association and an agent for

many of the game's top stars
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#16:3:A> Now this will be the first public airing of those allegations

against Eagleson in Canada but as <@> Adam Bach </@> reports it may not get

very far

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-010#17:3:B> The Law Society complaint alleges professional misconduct by

Eagleson <,> and conduct unbecoming a solicitor
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#18:3:B> The complaint is a lengthy one <,> it's seventeen pages
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#19:3:B> In it Eagleson is accused of such things as loaning Players

Association money without getting consent <,> and of deliberately misleading

certain players including former hockey great Bobby Orr
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#20:3:B> The complaint says Orr could have become a part owner of the Boston

Bruins <,> but his agent at the time Alan Eagleson didn't tell him
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#21:3:B> The Law Society set aside three weeks to hear from players like Orr

<,> and to hear other legal arguments to decide if Eagleson should be

disciplined <,> he could be disbarred
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#22:3:B> But the hearing may not last long
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#23:3:B> Eagleson's lawyer <@> Daniel Kingsman </@> wants it delayed
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#24:3:B> Eagleson faces serious criminal charges in the U S including fraud

racketeering and embezzlement <,> and he could be extradited to face those

charges soon
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#25:3:B> <@> Daniel Kingsman </@> says that has to be dealt with first <,>

that Eagleson should have his day in court in the U S before the Law Society

goes ahead with its hearing
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#26:3:B> <@> Kingsman </@> says Eagleson has promised not to practice law in

the interim
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#27:3:B> So the Eagelson case could be put on hold once again in Canada <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#28:3:B> It's now been more than five years since the Law Society received

its initial complaint

<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#32:3:A> Graham uh is thirty-six years old
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#33:3:A> He says he wants to walk away from hockey while he can still walk
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#34:3:A> He's been <}> <-> in uh </-> <=> with </=> </}> the Black Hawks

since nineteen eighty-eight and will actually stay on with the team as an

<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#73:6:A> And in Toronto the Boston Redsox swept a four game series with the

discuss reopening talks with the N B A
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#81:6:A> So there's much uh sort of labour talk in sports as anything else

<O> laugh </O> these days unfortunately
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#82:6:A> It is sixteen minutes now past eight o'clock

<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#96:6:A> Clear skies again tomight and <,> more sunshine on the way tomorrow

so we're on <}> <-> a </-> <=> a </=> </}> really nice weather stretch
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#97:6:A> Coming up to eight thirty now and the regional news </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-010#98:7:A> Good morning
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#99:7:A> Well Michael Smith of Kenora Ontario has returned to his rightful

place among the elite in the world of the decathlon
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#100:7:A> Smith won the bronze medal in this gruelling event <,> ten events

in all
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#101:7:A> He started the second day of the competition yesterday in fifth

place <,> but after finishing first in the javelin and discus Smith wound up

third
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#102:7:A> Michael Smith actually did show a lot of promise some years ago

but has been hampered by nagging injuries recently however he is back and

adds a third medal to the list
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#103:7:A> A gold and silver going to our <,> hundred metre sprinters now the

bronze
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#104:7:A> And there's a chance for more medals on the way
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#105:7:A> For instance Angela Chalmers from Victoria has qualified <,> for

the final in the women's fifteen hundred metres <,> despite the fact that

she's had problems with asthma during her stay in Sweden
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#106:7:A> And Angela Chalmers here describes her strategy for tomorrow's

final

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-010#107:7:B> The priority in the final will be <,> to race up to my

potential on the day
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#108:7:B> Uhm <,> and to come away from it learning something and to come

away from it <,> having enjoyed my experience here
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#109:7:B> It's been rough to enjoy it this time because <,> I've been

struggling so much
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#110:7:B> And I think that <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> you know I can't

deny that I'm a real <,> competitor and seeing Donovan win the other day was

just <,> you know I just sort of had to go wow that must be so incredible I

wish I could do that
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#111:7:B> But <,> you know it's his time and <}> <-> I'm </-> <=> I'm </=>

</}> just <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> have to focus on doing my

best
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#112:7:B> <}> <-> And </-> <=> and </=> </}> however that is <,> it's <}>

<-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> be enough

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-010#113:7:A> However while Angela Chalmers has advanced to the race for

the medals fellow Canadian Leah Pells from Coquitlam B C was left behind in

the fifteen hundred <,> and Pells talks about her semi-final

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S2B-010#114:7:C> I think <,> it was just a very very tough race
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#115:7:C> <}> <-> There was uh </-> <=> it was </=> </}> very very

aggressive
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#116:7:C> There was a lot of pack running a lot of getting slammed around

and <,> it tends to be <,> almost more uh emotionally draining than

physically draining <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#117:7:C> And <,> you know physically <}> <-> it's almost </-> <=> most </=>

</}> athletes can find it and it's the emotional part you know like <}> <->

you </-> <=> you </=> </}> just get it hammered right out of you
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#118:7:C> And in the last home stretch <,> I'm telling you I gave it every

single ounce within me and <,> that was all that there was <,> and I'm

disappointed that I couldn't find more
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#119:7:C> Really disappointed

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-010#120:7:A> Well that's <,> part of sports but it's also a learning

experience uh being disappointed once in a while
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#121:7:A> Checking the world of baseball
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#122:7:A> The Montreal Expos lost five one to the high-flying Altanta Braves
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#123:7:A> The Braves had eleven hits to help their cause
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#124:7:A> The Expos are off to Houston tonight
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#125:7:A> And the Toronto Blue Jays hit the road after losing four straight

to the Boston Redsox
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#126:7:A> The Redsox who are trying to take steps to nail down the American

League East Division crown beat the Jays five four in ten innings yesterday
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#127:7:A> The Jays are in Milwaukee this evening
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#128:7:A> A trade in the C F L involving the Toronto Argonauts and the

Ottawa Roughriders
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#129:7:A> The two teams exchanged placekickers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#130:7:A> The Argos sent Wayne Lammle to Ottawa along with linebacker Chris

Tsangaris and guard Mike Jovanovich
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#131:7:A> In return Ottawa <,> sends Terry Baker and guard Scott Douglas to

Toronto
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#132:7:A> In hockey former N H L <w> players' </w> boss Alan Eagleson is in

court today
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#133:7:A> He's to face a number of misconduct allegations while in the

position of power that he held over the <,> many years
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#134:7:A> The list of allegations is a long one and includes things like

misrepresenting players and misusing <w> players' </w> funds
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#135:7:A> Uh elsewhere in the world of hockey Dirk Graham who was captain of

the Chicago Black Hawks the past six and a half years has retired
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#136:7:A> He will become an assistant coach with the Hawks
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#137:7:A> The Black Hawks also hired former <&> New York </&> Islanders

Lorne Henning as an assistant
<ICE-CAN:S2B-010#138:7:A> And problems in the N B A continue </I>
