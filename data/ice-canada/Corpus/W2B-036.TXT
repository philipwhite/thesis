photographic reality. </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#3:1> <bold> By Chris Knowles </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#4:1> Behind a studio door the pop, pop of a commercial photographer's

army of strobes has been replaced by an odd clapping sound and what sounds

like the beep of a truck's backup warning signal.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#5:1> Inside, Pat LaCroix is bouncing around the set, waving the source of

these new and unusual sounds - the Hosemaster - over and around and under a

saxophone player and the tool of his trade.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#6:1> The Polaroid is held under the light of the studio's kitchen stove:

the image is remarkable.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#7:1> The bell of the sax ( from whence the sound emerges) glows with hazy

highlights.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#8:1> The player himself is awash in diffused light.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#9:1> And the difficult exposure bal <l> ance between the player's face and

the gleaming brass instrument has been pulled off perfectly.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#10:1> What's equally striking is how the image seems to be sharply defined

in one part and deliberately hazy in others. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#11:1> LaCroix, a professional photogra <l> pher for 25 years, is

clearly pleased. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#X12:1> <quote> " I've been shooting a long time, so it's important to get a

little creative buzz every now and then. When I started using the Hosemaster,

I began to think, 'Hey! I could use it for this, and this and this....' "

</quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#13:1> The Hosemaster, to hear Hose <l> master afficionados such as

LaCroix, Peter Horvath and Ottmar Bierwagen describe it, is an innova <l>

tive new creative tool that may change the face of studio photogra <l> phy.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#14:1> All three Toronto-based shoot <l> ers are using it, for both

corporate and personal work.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#15:1> <quote> " I have a feeling it's going to become a standard," </quote>

says Horvath. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#X16:1> <quote> " It's definitely right up there on the 'new' list."

</quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#17:1> <quote> " I was just astonished by the thing," </quote> adds

Bierwagen. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#X18:1> <quote> " I think it's the most interesting piece of lighting

innovation to come along in 20 years." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#19:1> Horvath makes a " vacuum cleaner" analogy; it's an apt descrip

<l> tion for the Hosemaster, invented by American photographer Aaron Jones,

looks just like a pull-along vacuum.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#20:1> Instead of sucking in dust, however, it beams out light through a

4.6-metre ( 15 ft.) length of fibre-optic cable.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#21:1> One end of the cable plugs into a rolling power-supply case, which

holds a fan-cooled quartz-arc 5500 K lamp.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#22:1> The business end of the cable is capped by a rectangular-shaped

plastic housing about the size of a small household paintbrush, onto which

light-shaping masks or gels can be clipped or Velcroed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#23:1> Holding this black " paintbrush" by hand, the photog <l> rapher

moves around the set, brushing a stroke of light here, dabbing a pinpoint

beam there.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#24:1> Horvath says it's the closest he's ever come to <quote> " feeling

like a painter." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#25:1> The Hosemaster differs from other fibre-optic lighting systems,

such as the HMI ( in existence for 15 years), in that it has its own shutter

system, which is mounted on a stand just in front of the camera lens.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#26:1> The shutter is operated by a button on the paintbrush; another button

causes a filter holder ( usually fitted with a soft-focus filter) to swing up

in front of the lens.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#27:1> To create a picture, then, the studio is made dark, the camera is set

for a time exposure, and the photographer uses the paintbrush to illuminate

various parts of the scene, click <l> ing the noisy shutter ( the source of

that clapping noise) open and closed as he paints with the light, swinging

the filter back and forth to make some highlights soft, some hard.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#28:1> A beeper sounds at one-second intervals while the shutter is open to

help the photographer time each exposure: a half-beep wash for the

saxophonist's face ( so he's not restricted to stay perfectly still), four

beeps for the sax's bell, and so on.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#29:1> And on.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#30:1> LaCroix's masterly photographing of an otherwise near-impossible pub

<l> licity shot of his friend Al Clootens, consisted of three different

exposures: an initial wash with a wide-open Hosemaster diffused; gold gel

clipped into the Hosemas <l> ter which was then stuck inside the sax's bell

and ex <l> posed for four seconds; a half-second exposure with the Hosemaster

outside the sax.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#31:1> Once the initial wash is over, and the face is properly exposed, it

doesn't matter if the face moves at all, since these are all separate

exposures.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#32:1> ( The glow around the sax player was from a diffuser placed in front

of the lens.)
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#33:1> <quote> " It's a lot of mental gymnastics," </quote> admits LaCroix.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#34:1> What LaCroix and others love about the system is the lighting

accuracy it affords.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#35:1> <quote> " You can really isolate the light," </quote> says LaCroix.

<X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#X36:1> <quote> " Even with the most spectral of strobe spots, you can

really only get so small.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#X37:1> I'm always playing around with shaving mirrors ( to get a narrow

beam), but even then you still get spillover." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#38:1> LaCroix pulls out a picture of a collection of small dolls, each

of which was lighted individually and differ <l> ently.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#39:1> The face of a very ugly, old French hunchback doll was lit from

underneath to enhance the sense of ugliness, while a delicate porcelain doll

was given a softer wash of light with diffusion.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#40:1> The face of one of the dolls is pin-sharp, the others slightly

diffused.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#41:1> <quote> " You can make one face focused and one diffused with a

strobe, but you'd never be able to get the different qualities of light with

any other type of lighting," </quote> he points out. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#42:1> Because the lighting is applied by hand, and the exposure timed

by ear, invariably each frame is slightly different from the one before, and

each truly the creative product of the individual holding the " brush."
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#43:1> This unpredictability in the Hosemaster's char <l> acter is something

Ottmar Bierwagen en <l> joys. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#X44:1> <quote> " Every image you get out of it is unique, and there's a

little bit of a thrill in that because you sort of don't know what's coming."

</quote> </X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#45:1> Bierwagen created the still life shown here by starting with a strobe

ex <l> posure of two stops under what his meter read, followed by about 15

exposures using the Hosemaster.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#46:1> Holding the light close to the flowers, he painted the stems with a

slashing motion, and then waved the light inside the buds for about three sec

<l> onds each.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#47:1> Next, he projected the light through the back of the vase for about

20 seconds to give it <quote> " just a small hint of translucence." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#48:1> Using a mask with a tiny opening for the light beam, he then circled

the light around one side of the pear and red marble. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#X49:1> <quote> " You can't control strobes well enough to give you that

many spots of light; you'd have to have 35 snoots of vari <l> ous kinds all

over the place." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#50:1> Constant movement of the Hosemaster " paintbrush" ( and the

photographer's body parts) is necessary to avoid imprint <l> ing a ghost

silhouette on the film.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#51:1> And, of course, the light mustn't be aimed directly at the lens. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#52:1> A concern of some photographers is that the " Hosehead look" will

too soon be <l> come a clich&eacute;?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#53:1> Peter Horvath doesn't agree.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#54:1> Initially skeptical of its potential, Horvath soon fell in love with

the versatility of the system and the hot neon colors the light produces.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#55:1> <quote> " I'm seeing a real saturation I wouldn't normally get with

strobes," </quote> he says. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#X56:1> <quote> " I feel like I'm on to something with it: a really new way

of shooting." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#57:1> Horvath's " new mutant art form", as he calls it, springs from

his technique of not using a base strobe exposure at all, but instead relying

on the Hosemaster - usu <l> ally heavily gelled - for all of an image's

light.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#58:1> <quote> " One disadvantage," </quote> he says, <quote> " is that I

have to remember what I did - how long I exposed each area. </X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#59:1> I'm trying to develop it into an intuitive thing; I'd like it to come

more from my gut than from my head." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#60:1> This kind of innovation doesn't come cheap, however.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#61:1> Vistek in Toronto, Cana <l> dian agent for the Hosemaster, is asking

&dollar;8,695, or &dollar;150 per day on rental. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#62:1> LaCroix bit the bullet and bought one, but both Bierwagen and

Horvath are still reeling from sticker shock.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#63:1> The cost is bound to come down, though, as the Hose <l> master's

popularity spawns imitators. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#64:1> And most feel the Hosemaster will catch on quickly, as

photographers and art direc <l> tors continue to experiment with a new way of

painting with light.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#65:1> As Ottmar Bier <l> wagen notes, <quote> " The style in photography

for the last 10 years has been to haul out that 10-foot bank of light and

whap through two or three or four thousand watts and make it nice and even

and smooth from edge to edge.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#66:1> I think that style is changing, thanks in part to younger pho <l>

tographers who are using hot lights and shadows and are breaking all the

rules.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#67:1> This Hosemaster kind of lighting system is one more tool of change."

<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#70:2> BY RON JEGERINGS <O> diagrams </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#71:2> For both amateurs and profession <l> als, one of the great

photographic puzzles is the way in which light loses intensity over distance.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#72:2> Logically, moving a light from two metres away to four metres from

the set should halve the intensity.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#73:2> Logically, you open the lens one stop.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#74:2> But your light meter says two stops and the aperture is too large for

depth-of-field.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#75:2> Move the light closer and illumination is too uneven across the set.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#76:2> You become like the proverbial cat chas <l> ing its tail. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#77:2> If light loss isn't logical, how can any <l> one gain control?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#78:2> Fortunately, a logical pattern is described by the inverse square

law.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#79:2> The mathematics are basic, and once the concept is understood you can

chuck the pocket calculator. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#80:2> Though terms like light loss and fall <l> off are convenient,

they are misleading.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#81:2> Light isn't lost over distance, just dis <l> persed differently.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#82:2> Darkroom workers will understand dispersion.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#83:2> As an en <l> larger head is raised, more of the easel is illuminated,

but it is merely the same amount of light spread over a larger area. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#84:2> The key, technically speaking, is the inverse square law.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#85:2> It doesn't matter whether you use feet or metres to calcu <l> late,

though metres may be too broad and centimetres too minute, for the prin <l>

ciple of the inverse square law still holds true: l/2 <sp> 2 </sp> and 1/4

<sp> 2 </sp> = 1/4 and 1/16 </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#86:2> Light intensities are 1/4 and 1/16 at two and four metres

respectively, which ex <l> plains why the meter recommends two stops instead

of one stop more exposure at the longer distance. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#87:2> What happens if we make 1/4 and 1/16, f/4 and f/l6?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#88:2> Away go the math calcula <l> tions when working under pressure.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#89:2> You can match distances to aperture numbers simply because aperture

light control is related to the inverse square law.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#90:2> One side of a set might be four feet from the light ( f/4) and the

far side eight feet ( f/8).
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#91:2> Two stops of light are lost, which is only acceptable for a special

effect. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#92:2> Understanding the inverse square law is essential for

understanding light in photography and for solving all sorts of lighting

problems such as how to achieve even illumination. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#93:2> Lighting problems are inevitable it you do not understand the

difference between uneven illumination and high contrast - an easy

misunderstanding since uneven light can be almost as con <l> trasty as light

that casts deep shadows.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#94:2> To cure uneven light, a photographer might add a fill light at the

camera, which fills in the shadows but still results in uneven light by

illuminating both sides equally. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#95:2> Understanding how much light is lost at near distances helps when

on-camera flash causes washed-out foregrounds and black-hole backgrounds.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#96:2> Black backgrounds may not fill a shot - if they add drama or obscure

unwanted objects - but washed-out foreground faces are deadly.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#97:2> When space allows, try a longer lens and shoot from a greater

distance for more even illumination. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#98:2> Bounce flash isn't used in color as it is in black and white, for

off-white ceilings and walls can create oddly-hued com <l> plexions.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#99:2> Even so, when the bounce sur <l> face is off-white ( or near-white

without the cold tint of green or blue), bounce flash increases light

distances ( from light to bounce surface and then back to sub <l> jects) and

illumination is more even.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#100:2> The only stipulation may be to use a fill card on the flash head to

open up shadows cast by bounce lighting.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#101:2> Moving a light far enough back requires unacceptably large

apertures, or the knocking out of a wall.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#102:2> The solution is to use fill cards on the opposite side of the set to

bounce the light. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#103:2> Again, there is confusion between the contributions of even

light and fill in lowering contrast.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#104:2> A large source - such as ceiling or wall with bounce flash creates

its own fill to lower the con <l> trast.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#105:2> Therefore, there is a tendency to attribute contrast reduction

solely to source size and discount the contribu <l> tion of even

illumination. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#106:2> An umbrella is a large source which provides its own fill and

lowers contrast.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#107:2> When used for bounce flash it also re <l> duces light fall-off since

the light travels up the shaft before returning to the sub <l> ject,

increasing light distance.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#108:2> Some photographers call umbrellas wall ex <l> tenders, for they are

particularly helpful in expanding small rooms. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-036#109:2> Feathering the light is another trick.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#110:2> Since most the lights have a brighter central hot spot in the

illumination patch, you can aim a light in such a way that bright central

rays travel farthest, thus creating more even illumination.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#111:2> Some lights are difficult to feather.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-036#112:2> When there's no visi <l> ble hot spot and no intense central light,

it's not so easy to know exactly where to aim the centre of the light to

achieve even illumination. </p> </I>
