<ICE-CAN:W1A-015#4:1> Osana's perception of Dalwood before was of a big <del> <.> clum </.>

<ICE-CAN:W1A-015#8:1> It reflects the <del> tone or </del> view of the narrator in <del> the

fact that Ellen survives her ordeal is largely due to her <del> <.> exi </.>

<ICE-CAN:W1A-015#13:1> Mudrooroo <del> <unclear> unclear words </unclear> </del> implicitly

<ICE-CAN:W1A-015#15:1> However, Jangamuttuk quietly placates the <quote> tame spirit

</quote> for the sake of harmony saying <quote> About to boss </quote> , just

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-015#16:1> This quotation from Mara's story ' <?> Ripul </?> Leaves' is

also is wise in the cultural <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del>

<ICE-CAN:W1A-015#18:1> Dr. Naigar asserts <del> this </del> her connection with her patients

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-015#21:1> The passage illuminates the limits that Lawson places on his

that she is <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> switching out of

the 'true' female role to such a degree that her own baby <del> doesn't

<ICE-CAN:W1A-015#22:1> Lawson also indicates that except for the help of four bushmen ( who

<ICE-CAN:W1A-015#23:1> The fact that she kills the snake <del> <unclear> unclear word

</unclear> </del> in the story is tempered by the fact that she gets help

from <del> a boy </del> her son and her dog ( who also in combination must be

<ICE-CAN:W1A-015#33:1> Fada, <del> <unclear> unclear words </unclear> has trained </del>
