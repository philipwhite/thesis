bureaucracy numerous procedures and so on and so forth
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#19:1:A> So some don't like that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#20:1:A> And if they don't they just recycle
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#21:1:A> They make their money here <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#22:1:A> They sell the business here

<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#28:1:A> He says others come in and they're good from two million to eight

million <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#29:1:A> And then you have the experts from eight million <,> and so on
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#30:1:A> But he says he's good up till two million dollars <,> and at two

million dollars he sells the company starts another one <,,> and then the

people from the two million <?> to eight million </?> category come in and

buy it off him <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#31:1:A> <?> Better <?> he says <?> that way <?> he says they come in you

you've got to make decisions at each stage

<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#49:1:A> We're quite happy right where we are

<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#53:1:A> That's the beauty of being in business for yourself
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#54:1:A> You decide
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#55:1:A> There's not a board of directors that comes and tells you <,> what

you have to do <,,>

<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#62:1:A> <unclear> a few words </unclear> glasses eh
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#63:1:A> I'll ask the question

I'll say <,> is this </=> </}> green <,> or blue
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#65:1:A> How many will say green and I'm telling you the minute <unclear>

word </unclear> put up their hands everybody will be <unclear> two or three

words </unclear> before they put up their hand <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#66:1:A> That's conformity
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#67:1:A> <}> <-> That's </-> <=> that's </=> </}> being afraid of being

judged by others
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#68:1:A> If you go in business for yourself you have to avoid that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#69:1:A> You have to just say yup <,,> or nope or decide for yourself
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#70:1:A> If everybody else looks and says boy are you ever a nut say I guess

so <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#71:1:A> You have to be able to shake it off uh because if you listen too

much to what other people are saying <}> <-> or </-> <=> or </=> </}> judging

you by then uh you're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> have problems

making it in business
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#72:1:A> Based on this <,> can anyone be an entrepreneur <,,>

<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#75:1:A> You know if you're not a good sales person take a partner who is

friend <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#78:1:A> Never go in business with a friend on that basis alone

factor when you're buying a business
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#107:1:A> When people go to buy a business you have to be careful because a

lot of times the whole of the business <,> is based on the personality of the

<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#108:1:A> And so in other words all kinds of customers coming into the store

by their first name they knew him and so <unclear> a few word </unclear> know

you <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#111:1:A> So you can lose business on that

Ben and Jerry's

having the vision and not allowing anybody else to knock you off the track

<,,> and not allowing yourself to knock yourself off the track
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#130:1:A> You can be your own worst enemy

<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#136:1:A> Nobody's going to teach you because then you're the competitor
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#137:1:A> I've worked for <,> three entrepreneurs in my life <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#138:1:A> All of them <,> very well off

<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#140:1:A> Interesting
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#141:1:A> No entrepreneur and I'm talking multi-millionaires none of them

had money
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#142:1:A> They're be bumming coffees off me and cigarettes <,> because all

their money was tied up back in the business back in the business
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#143:1:A> They had no cash
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#144:1:A> These people were very successful
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#145:1:A> <?> Did they </?> teach me how to be an entrepreneur
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#146:1:A> Not on your life
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#147:1:A> It's called here I am if you want to try and learn from me watch

me and follow me or do what you want but there's no way they're going to hold

your hand and say here's how you do it <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#148:1:A> So there's no training <,> ground
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#149:1:A> You know if you go in to be <,> anything a plumber a carpenter if

you go into ah uh a computer situation you're going to have somebody teaching

you the skills
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#150:1:A> As an entrepreneur they're not going to teach you the skills
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#151:1:A> You're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> have to learn

them on your own
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#152:1:A> So let's assume everybody can be an entrepreneur
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#153:1:A> You've got a vision a direction
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#154:1:A> You're not allowing yourself to be <,> swayed off track
<ICE-CAN:S2A-042#155:1:A> Then the question <}> <-> becomes </-> <=> is </=> </}> where's

the opportunity what's the idea where do we find the good idea
