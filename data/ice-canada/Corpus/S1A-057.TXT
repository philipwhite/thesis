<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#2:1:B> He's got a solution to that
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#3:1:B> He's got a huge screen T <{> <[> V <,> </[> with a little inset so

<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#7:1:B> <@> Matt </@> why do you do that
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#8:1:B> Doesn't that confuse you
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#9:1:B> No more than your reading five books at a time he says <{> <[> <O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#10:1:A> <[> Good point good point </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#11:1:B> <@> Ralph </@> teases me because <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=>

uh <,> <}> <-> you </-> <=> you </=> </}> need one <,> you know just in your

you

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#13:1:A> <[> Mhh hmm </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#14:1:A> I don't use a purse <,,> <{> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#15:1:B> <[> Ya but you you know </[> </{> your pocket or whatever
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#16:1:B> And uh <,> when I was going to school <,> I used to have one <,> in

the front room and one in the bathroom and one in the bedroom of course
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#17:1:B> Cos you read at night
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#18:1:B> And uh <,> then one with my school books <,> and then one in my

desk so that <,> you know when I was supposed to be reading doing my Latin or

whatever and it was boring I'd <,,> have the book stuck in between <{> <[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#19:1:A> <[> Right </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#20:1:B> But <?> everybody else </?> teases me and says well how can

you keep track of that many books at once <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#21:1:B> I don't know I just do
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#22:1:B> Or uh like I can read the first page of a book and know if I have

ever in my life read that book

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#23:1:A> Really

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#24:1:B> Ya
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#25:1:B> <}> <-> It's </-> <=> it's </=> </}> strange
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#26:1:B> Uhm as soon as <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> read the first page

oh ya I remember this book

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#29:1:A> I wish I had a memory like that

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#30:1:B> But it's only <}> <-> in </-> <=> in </=> </}> that sort of

thing
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#31:1:B> <}> <-> I </-> <=> my </=> </}> memory like <O> laugh </O> short

<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#32:1:B> Or did I <{> <[> take them <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#33:1:B> Ya </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#34:1:A> <[> Oh no no no you've never had that problem no never no </[>

</{> no

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#35:1:B> But when it comes to stories that I've read uh that's

different again
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#36:1:B> <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> can uh <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#37:1:B> And it doesn't matter whether it's just a <,,> Harlequin romance

type thing or if it's

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#38:1:A> I've never read one of those

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#39:1:B> Oh they <&> not " they're" </&> good light reading <,> <{> <[>

but </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#40:1:A> <[> <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> </[> </{> can't bring

myself to

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#41:1:B> Well there's a lot that you skip over but <,,> I find that the

interesting part is that they're set in different parts of the world

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#42:1:A> Mhh

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#43:1:B> And so <,,> you learn different things about <,> other

countries
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#44:1:B> So <}> <-> you </-> <=> you </=> </}> can <,> skip over the garbage

parts you know

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#45:1:A> I was sitting in a lounge <}> <-> and and </-> <=> and </=>

</}> somehow the topic of Harlequin romances came up and then two of the

women said oh they're always the same they both agreed
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#46:1:A> And somehow <}> <-> they </-> <=> they </=> </}> started

constructing <,> your basic plot for every Harlequin <{> <[> romance </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#47:1:B> <[> Oh ya </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#48:1:A> And they were both coming up with <,> exactly what the other

person was thinking of
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#49:1:A> Apparently they had both read the same one <{> <[> coincidently

</[> but

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#50:1:B> <[> Ya ya </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#51:1:B> Ya no that's true
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#52:1:B> They <}> <-> are </-> <=> basically </=> </}> have a basic plot and

they just uh work around it it seems
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#53:1:B> But <}> <-> they </-> <=> they </=> </}> make for easy light

reading and so you know when you want a break from anything uh a little

heavier well <,> <}> <-> they make alright </-> <=> they're alright </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#54:1:B> They're not my favourite reading but

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#55:1:A> That's what comic books are for
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#56:1:A> Come on

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#57:1:B> Ya well see now I never did get into comic books
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#58:1:B> Although uhm <,> <}> <-> we </-> <=> we </=> </}> do use them in

the school system uh <,> oddly enough <{> <[> uh for youngsters </[> who

don't uhm <,> like to read

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#59:1:A> <[> Oh I can believe it </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#60:1:B> It's a good way of getting them going <{> <[> <,,> </[> you

know

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#61:1:A> <[> Ya I can believe it </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#62:1:A> The vocabulary there is pretty high tech though
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#63:1:A> I remember in grade seven I used my comic books for my <?> weekly

</?> vocabulary lists

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#64:1:B> <{> <[> Mhh hmm </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#65:1:A> <[> And </[> </{> <,> the words were like you know <,> three

<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#66:1:A> <{2> <[2> <,> </[2> quite complex

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#67:1:B> <[1> Mhh hmm </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#68:1:B> <[2> Ya </[2> </{2>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#69:1:B> Ya they are good and uhm <{> <[> <,,> I </[> think we've found that

uh Archie is one of the better ones

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#70:1:A> <[> <O> cough </O> </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#71:1:B> Ehm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#72:1:A> For what age group

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#73:1:B> Uh grade five grade six
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#74:1:B> Ya ya
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#75:1:B> Because at that age boys in particular <,> don't really want to uhm

<,> uhm <}> <-> <}> <-> <.> sh </.> </-> <+> show </+> </}> </-> <=> either

show </=> </}> that they like to read <,> or uhm they don't really like to

read
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#76:1:B> And so uh in order to get them interested <,> that's one way
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#77:1:B> <?> Allow </?> them to read the comic books

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#78:1:A> That's what I'm a bit worried about teaching English as a

second language
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#79:1:A> How do I get kids who don't like reading in their first language

interested in reading <{> <[> <}> <-> in in </-> <=> in </=> </}> their

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#80:1:B> <[> Hmm <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#81:1:B> Get </[> </{> the comic books
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#82:1:B> Ya they really are good for them
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#83:1:B> Uhm <,,> surprisingly because
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#84:1:B> And they're not violent
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#85:1:B> <}> <-> In in </-> <=> the </=> </}> Archie comic books in

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#86:1:A> <[> Right right </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-057#87:1:B> And uhm <,,> right now you know back to the fifties type

them
<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#91:1:B> So <,,> <}> <-> it it </-> <=> they </=> </}> feel a little more

<ICE-CAN:S1A-057#95:1:B> But something that's funny
