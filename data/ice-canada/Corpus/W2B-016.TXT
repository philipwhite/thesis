<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#1:1> <h> <bold> the best doctors money can buy </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#2:1> <h> A privileged minority is using private insurance to jump the

health-care queue </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#3:1> <bold> By Kyle Stone </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#4:1> Dr. M. is a noted urologist practising in a large Toronto hospital

in a suite of offices he shares with several others.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#5:1> Yet these offices are as quiet as if they were in a private clinic.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#6:1> The chairs are soft.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#7:1> The at <l> tractive young assistants and secretaries dress well; with

patients and doctors alike, they remain honey-voiced and discreet.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#8:1> Dr. M. and his colleagues specialize in prostate patients, some of

them high-pro <l> file ones: the offices are full of bankers and lawyers and

big investors. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#9:1> Unlike his colleagues, however, Dr. M. is a member of a

specialist-referral net <l> work, a group of doctors organized and hired by a

company known as an inde <l> pendent medical-assessment service.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#10:1> These companies recruit doctors from big hos <l> pitals and small

clinics: cardiologists, urol <l> ogists, psychiatrists, back doctors, ophthal

<l> mologists; specialists in livers and kidneys and glands, in impotence and

gastroin <l> testinal problems.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#11:1> They recruit clients too: companies that offer their employees ac <l>

cess to the service through the company insurance plan.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#12:1> The assessment service then sends the employee to one doctor or

another within the network.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#13:1> It promis <l> es rapid medical attention, guaranteed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#14:1> <mention> " Rapid medical attention" </mention> means calling up

a doctor, usually on short notice, and asking if there's a time slot

available for, say, a checkup that afternoon.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#15:1> If a time isn't available with the first member doctor, the

assessment service will place the client with another.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#16:1> But since the doctors are paid, by some estimates, nearly twice as

much for some procedures as they would get from the public health-insurance

plan, the first doctor called is almost always available.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#17:1> If an ordinary medicare patient is sched <l> uled for that time slot,

and his visit is not a medical emergency, Dr. M.'s secretary will call with

the regretful news of the doctor's urgent staff meeting or nasty cold or sud

<l> den personal family crisis.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#18:1> The visit will be postponed, and the matter will stay between the

doctor and his secretary, the one who keeps his appointment book. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#19:1> Every so often, someone from Dr. M.'s particular

medical-assessment company comes by to drop off some forms for him to fill

out.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#20:1> When Dr. M. hired a new sec <l> retary recently, the company's

representa <l> tive came by to tell her about the basic arrangement.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#21:1> <quote> " The basic arrangement," </quote> says Fred Holmes, a

health-benefits con <l> sultant with the firm Towers, Perrin, who is familiar

with assessment companies, <quote> " is to book some time with a group of spe

<l> cialists.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#22:1> <X> They say, 'okay, we'll pay you these dollars, and we get bumping

privileges in your list.' </X> " </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#23:1> And their clients get to jump the queue.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#24:1> A health-insurance executive in Wa <l> terloo, Ontario, describes

assessment com <l> panies as having <quote> " developed a network of expert

bastards that are resident in our [ health-care] system, that are prepared to

take private billings and do private physi <l> cals.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#25:1> And they've found a legal way to do it." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#26:1> Indeed they have.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#27:1> While former office workers describe Dr. M. as <quote> " crowing"

</quote> about all the money he can make this way, they say he is especially

proud of one thing - it's all completely legal. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#28:1> Dr. M. is not alone in his desire to make more money.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#29:1> Caps and claw <l> backs on their fees have many doctors, particularly

specialists, on the warpath.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#30:1> In Ontario this summer, both obstetricians and orthopaedic surgeons

threatened ser <l> vice cuts if the governing Tories didn't re <l> voke these

caps, and a coalition of special <l> ists advised its members to stop

accepting new patients after October 1. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#31:1> Nor is Dr. M. alone in heeding the siren call of private medical

services.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#32:1> The Canadian Medical Association put pri <l> vate funding for health

care - in other words, two-tier medicine - back on the agenda of its annual

conference.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#33:1> ( Its mem <l> bers had voted down the issue in 1994.)
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#34:1> Dr. M., though, has found a simpler way into the world of private

medicine.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#35:1> In expansive moments, he's confided that he's found a loophole in the

system, one that, as Fred Holmes puts it, <quote> " is, or can be, mammoth."

</quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#36:1> The loophole is this: the Canada Health Act guarantees all

Canadians universal and equal access to medically necessary services.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#37:1> But it also contains something called the <mention> " Exclusion

Paragraph." </mention> The Ex <l> clusion Paragraph has two main points.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#38:1> One, if a company pays <w> workers' </w> - com <l> pensation

premiums, then its <w> employees' </w> job-related injuries and illnesses are

paid for by <w> Workers' </w> Compensation, and not by the provincial

health-insurance plan.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#39:1> Two, if an employer, or a life-, disability-, or auto-in <l> surance

company requires you to have a medical checkup, that checkup is not con <l>

sidered " medically necessary."
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#40:1> Instead it's called a <it> third-party payer procedure </it> , and,

again, provincial health plans won't cover it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#41:1> Clearly, the Exclusion Paragraph was designed to keep the system

honest: <w> Work <l> ers' </w> Comp pays for work-related medical problems;

third parties - employers and insurers - pay for what they require; and the

public system pays for everything else that's medically necessary, for

everyone.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#42:1> Ironically, the Exclusion Paragraph has also served to open a window

of opportunity for doctors to make more money than they would in the public

system, by doing private or " third-party" work.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#43:1> That's why specialist-referral networks and medical-assessment

services have sprung up and are growing quickly.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#44:1> OHIP, for instance, pays a doctor &dollar;51.40 for a "

consultation," &dollar;105.40 for a " consultation for respiratory disease."

(
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#45:1> Every provincial health plan has its own schedule of fees.)
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#46:1> But if a service is provided on a private basis, the fee is whatever

the doctor and the third party, whether it's an insurer or an assessment

company, agree to. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#47:1> So doctors have an incentive to look for private work

Assessment-service compa <l> nies operate as middlemen, working be <l> tween

the employer and the doctor, or be <l> tween the employer's insurance company

and the doctor. (
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#48:1> Perhaps because of this, not all insurance companies look kindly on

medical-assessment services.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#49:1> Some prefer to build their own stable of doctors direct <l> ly.)
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#50:1> There are assessment companies, like Rapid-Med, that work only with

life-, auto-, and health-insurance companies, hir <l> ing doctors to do

pre-employment med <l> icals and the checkups needed for long-term

disability-insurance claims.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#51:1> Others, like Medcan Health Management Inc., offer comprehensive

in-house checkups for executives, disability-claims assessment for injured

line workers, and a specialist-referral network that in some cases by <l>

passes the insurance company altogether to form its own exclusive triangle:

em <l> ployer, high-ranking executive employee, and specialist-network

physician. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#52:1> The idea is to get patients diagnosed faster than provincial

medicare can man <l> age.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#53:1> Of course, if these patients had stayed in the public health-care

system, they would be waiting in line precisely because the checkups they

need aren't considered medically necessary.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#54:1> An irony of assess <l> ment companies is that they can get their

clients a procedure that's not considered urgent faster than one that is.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#55:1> The clients who take advantage of the kind of organized

queue-jumping assess <l> ment services offer can be divided into several

major groups.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#56:1> There are the em <l> ployers who are frustrated and want their sick

or hurt employee back to work.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#57:1> They'd also like to make sure the employee isn't just faking it.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#58:1> There are auto-insurance companies who want their claimants diag <l>

nosed as quickly as possible.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#59:1> And there are employers who provide access to specialist networks as

a perk to a select senior-man <l> agement group. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#60:1> What they get is preferred access to top specialists like Dr. M.,

and checkups that are more leisurely and that can be more comprehensive than

those offered to reg <l> ular medicare patients.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#61:1> There is also the benefit, for both patient and doctor, of networking

over the stethoscope - of chumminess and social cachet. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#62:1> Dr. Bob Francis has been president of Med <l> can since the

mid-1970s.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#63:1> As Francis seems to be the godfather of specialist networks, I

expected a chat with the Prince of Dark <l> ness when I phoned him up.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#64:1> Instead, he sounded kindly and a little befuddled, more like Mr.

Magoo than Dr. Doom.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#65:1> After outlining his company's specialist-re <l> ferral network for

me, Dr. Francis told me earnestly, <quote> " I don't call that two-tiered med

<l> icine.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#66:1> I call that access to care in a mean <l> ingful way." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#67:1> Francis, in other words, claims he's simply helping his clients down

a <it> different </it> avenue to certain medical services.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#68:1> When I asked him if that didn't amount to helping his clients nose in

ahead of public patients waiting to see the same doctors, he had clearly been

waiting for the question. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#69:1> <X> <quote> " The way I answer that is, what's not recognized ... is

that he [ the doctor] doesn't bump OHIP patients.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#X70:1> OHIP has already decreed that he can see only so many pa <l> tients

per month.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#X71:1> And by he or she seeing one of our patients it actually frees up a

spot for another OHIP patient.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#X72:1> So, if any <l> thing, it has the reverse effect.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#X73:1> You're also freeing up some dollars.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#X74:1> The person who's coming through our system is actually helping to

subsidize the system." </quote> </X>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#75:1> Dr. Philip Berger, a family practition <l> er in downtown Toronto

who has culti <l> vated a reputation as a critic of the medical

establishment, snorts at the notion that private service speeds the public

system along.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#76:1> <X> <quote> " Other people will have a longer, not a shorter, wait,

because the doctors aren't available, because the wealthy and the

beneficiaries of insurance plans keep pushing themselves in.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#X77:1> If you're standing in line at a movie theatre and someone in a white

fox coat hurries to the head of the line and goes inside and calls back over

their shoulder, 'See, the line is shorter now,' would you believe it?"

</quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#78:1> Fred Holmes muses: <quote> " Yep.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#79:1> It's del <l> icate .. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#X80:1> You <it> are </it> slipping people in.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#X81:1> But, you know, a doctor has the total choice, in his office

practice, to choose who he sees and who he doesn't see, and who he stays late

for, and who he slips in first thing in the morning." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#82:1> Those in the medical-assessment busi <l> ness simply do not

concede that this caus <l> es problems.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#83:1> Alexander Gourley, president of Health Resource Management Ltd., a

<quote> " diagnostic and assessment facilitator" </quote> that works in

Alberta, defends his business in much the same way as Bob Francis, depict <l>

ing it as a nonthreatening departure from medicare.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#84:1> HRM, he stresses, covers only diagnostic assessments - which aren't

cov <l> ered under Alberta Health - and not the treatments themselves, which

are.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#85:1> <quote> " Any of the services we require are, by definition,

uninsured," </quote> Gourley says.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#86:1> <X> <quote> " When a patient requires a treatment service covered by

a provincial health plan, then they're treat <l> ed as equally as anyone

else.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#X87:1> They bill the Alberta health-insurance plan.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#X88:1> And we don't influence their movement through the queue.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#X89:1> What we're looking for is a re <l> turn-to-work diagnostic

assessment.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#X90:1> Then we negotiate terms and conditions with doctors, as does

everyone else." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#91:1> This raises a few questions, however.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#92:1> Isn't <quote> " expediting and facilitating specialist referral"

</quote> to <quote> " establish or confirm diagnosis and duration of

disability" </quote> as Gourley de <l> scribes his company's services, still

just a nice way to say paying for faster medical attention?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#93:1> And once a patient has jumped ahead for a referral, isn't his

treatment in <l> evitably speeded up as well, even if it is done in the

public system?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#94:1> As Philip Berg <l> er, in discussing the private sector's impact on

the public one, points out: <quote> " A doctor can't sit there and say 'Well,

the only rea <l> son you're here is because your employer sent you, therefore

I'm not going to listen to your chest. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#X95:1> I'm not going to pay atten <l> tion to the fact you're drenched in

sweat and hot.'
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#X96:1> You have an obligation to do something for them, if that is the

case." </X> </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#97:1> And can we really be sure that all these private patients are

slipped in at the end of the day, or first thing in the morning, as

assessment companies claim?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#98:1> If they're not, if a regular OHIP patient waiting to have a medically

necessary service per <l> formed has to wait longer because the doctor's in

with someone whose appoint <l> ment is not medically necessary, common sense

says that this amounts to organized queue-jumping, and that it contravenes at

least the spirit, if not the letter, of the Canada Health Act. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#99:1> And is there always a hard and fast distinction made between

diagnosis and treatment?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#100:1> Or might doctors, particularly specialists protected by the privacy

of their offices, be persuaded to provide a medical <l> ly necessary service

faster, and off-OHIP, as it were, if the price were right? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#101:1> The very existence of this alternative, private avenue to

medical service, never mind its growth in recent years, opens the door to all

kinds of abuses that are difficult to track.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#102:1> Jim Par&eacute;, <w> Workers' </w> Comp special <l> ist at the

Ontario Federation of Labour, says he knows of injured line workers who have

been pressured into filing dis <l> ability-insurance claims rather than

filing <w> Workers' </w> Compensation claims, and so receiving a far smaller

settlement.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#103:1> ( Because a company's <w> Workers' </w> Comp premiums rise

dramatically the more claims it files, it's often cheaper in the long run for

the company to do this).
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#104:1> Fred Holmes says he has heard of an assessment service trying to

convince companies that, so long as they are paying <w> Workers' </w>

Compensation pre <l> miums for their line workers, then <it> all </it> their

employees are eligible to have their med <l> ical services handled <it>

outside </it> medicare.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#105:1> That provides justification, in other words, for having their

executives treated by specialist-referral network on a private basis, even

for medically necessary services.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#106:1> <quote> " Then you're into a world of illegal acts, as I understand

the law," </quote> says Holmes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#107:1> Third-party-payer procedures also create at least the potential

for doctors to bill the public system for services per <l> formed, and paid

for, on a private basis.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#108:1> Al Gourley, the president of HRM Ltd., insists: <quote> " We deal

with people who are first class, and whose integrity would never, never allow

them to be so compromised." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#109:1> But the fact remains that there's no way of knowing for sure, and

critics charge that, in Ontario at least, the government seems to be little

concerned with enforcing third-party-payer procedure laws.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#110:1> <quote> " I have to admit," </quote> says Ontario Ministry of Health

spokesman Paul Kilbertus, <quote> " We're not working too quickly towards it.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#111:1> But it is something we're committed to doing.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#112:1> It's never been a grey zone.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#113:1> It's been clear that we're not supposed to pay ... </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#114:1> In On <l> tario, the health professions are self-regu <l> lating.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#115:1> <quote> If they're billing twice," </quote> he con <l> cedes,

<quote> " there's no way we're going to know about it.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-016#116:1> Private companies don't tell <it> us </it> what doctors are billing

<it> them </it> for." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-016#117:1> And as for Bob Francis's contention that private service can

save the public sys <l> tem money, the opposite is more likely to be the

case. </p> </I>
