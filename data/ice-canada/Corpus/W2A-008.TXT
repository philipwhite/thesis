<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#3:1> P.B. WOOD

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-008#4:1> Given the special relationship assiduously cultivated in recent

years by Britain and the United States, it is hardly surprising that during

the last decade Margaret Thatcher has done more for American universities

than anyone since Hitler.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#5:1> Having created a thoroughly unhealthy climate within the British

university system and driven many talented academics into lucrative exile in

the us, Mrs Thatcher can at least now rest content with the thought that the

successful export of scholarly expertise helps to silence potential critics

of her brave new world, to improve Britain's ailing balance of trade, and to

trim public expenditure.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#6:1> It is therefore highly ironic that amid the tribal chants of <quote> "

Market Forces Rule <smallcaps> OK </smallcaps> " </quote> and the educational

hooliganism of Thatcher's Tory supporters, there has been a veritable

renaissance in Britain of the study of the history of universities, which has

enriched and sometimes transformed our knowledge of European academic life

since the foundation of the first universities in Salerno, Paris,

Montpellier, and Bologna in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-008#7:1> Prior to the late 1970s, the golden age of university history in

Britain was unquestionably the nineteenth century.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#8:1> One <}> <-> need </-> <+> needs </+> </}> only point to the volumes

penned by Hastings Rashdall on the medieval European universities, those by

J.B. Mulinger on Cambridge, those by Alexander Bower and Sir Alex <l> ander

Grant on Edinburgh, or the series of Oxford college histories pub <l> lished

between 1898 and 1903 to see that the Victorian era witnessed a remarkable

flowering of British scholarship dedicated to the developmentof institutions

of higher learning throughout western Europe.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#9:1> But since then, the field has had a more chequered career.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#10:1> For much of this century, a large proportion of the literature

produced has been either anecdotal or anti <l> quarian in character, and

often published to celebrate institutional milestones.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#11:1> While it would be churlish to deny that at least some of this com <l>

memorative work has been highly valuable, it would also be true to say that

until recently comparatively little historical attention was paid to such

topics as the prosopography of student bodies and of the professoriate, the

changes in university curricula, or the frequently unedifying realm of

academic politics; and it was only in the 1960s that the study of university

history took on a more analytical edge.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#12:1> Books edited or written by George Davie, Hugh Kearney, Sheldon

Rothblatt, Lawrence Stone, and E.G.W. Bill signalled renewed vigour, and the

subsequent appearance of important studies by Robert Anderson, Davie, and

John Gascoigne among others has confirmed the scholarly health of the field.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#13:1> As if to consolidate this revival, and mark the emergence of yet

another academic sub-discipline, the annual <it> History of Universities

</it> was launched in 1981 by the late Charles Schmitt, following a highly

successful conference on the theme held at the Warburg Institute in London in

1978, and the continued vitality of this journal attests to the flourishing

state of university history ( as opposed to the universities themselves) in

Britain. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-008#14:1> So too in their different ways do the fifth volume of <it> The

History of the Univer <l> sity of Oxford </it> , which covers the period c.

1688-1800, and Laurence Brockliss's meticulously crafted <it> French Higher

Education in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#15:1> The Oxford <it> History </it> is something of a curate's egg, for it

is made up of 32 essays of variable quality covering a wide variety of

topics.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#16:1> Historio <l> graphically, the volume is highly traditional in its

focus, since the bulk of the contributions deal with such themes as religion

and politics in the univer <l> sity, while the study of student life, for

example, is conspicuous by its absence.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#17:1> Nonetheless, a number of the chapters, like those by the late G.V.

Bennett on the <quote> " rage of party" </quote> in Oxford in the period

1688-1714, are of a high standard, and it must be said that the University -

supported project from which the <it> History </it> derives reflects a

refreshing and perhaps even en <l> lightened institutional sense of the value

of university history.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#18:1> Brockliss's monograph, on the other hand, is more in tune with recent

historiographical trends, and hence deals with topics like student life and

the wider cultural significance of the university curriculum in the <it>

ancien r&eacute;gime </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#19:1> As befits a work dealing with France, there are even a number of maps

illustrating the geographical distribution of universities and colleges drawn

in typical <it> Annales </it> fashion.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#20:1> While the Oxford volume is sometimes impressionistic and occa <l>

sionally lacking in analytical rigour, Brockliss combines close archival

research with a broad historical vision, and his book exemplifies the consi

<l> derable virtues of the research on the development of European univer <l>

sities currently being produced by British scholars. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#21:1> <h> I </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-008#22:1> Thanks in part to the memoirs of Edward Gibbon, the dominant

image of eighteenth-century Oxford is one of professorial negligence and

intellect <l> ual torpor.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#23:1> Looking back on his brief sojourn at Magdalen College in 1752-53

Gibbon condemned the <quote> " narrow, lazy, and oppressive" </quote> spirit

prevalent in the two English universities, and affirmed in a memorable

passage that <X> <quote> " [ t]o the University of Oxford <it> I </it>

acknowledge no obligation; and she will as cheer <l> fully renounce me for a

son, as I am willing to disclaim her for a mother.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#X24:1> I spent fourteen months at Magdalen College; they proved ... the

most idle and unprofitable of my whole life" </quote> </X> ( 29-30).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#25:1> Adam Smith, who was a Snell Exhibitioner at Balliol from 1740 until

1746, echoed Gibbon's harsh judg <l> ment.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#26:1> In <it> The Wealth of Nations </it> , Smith contended that the system

of class fees common in the Scottish universities encouraged professors to

exert themselves in their teaching, and he contrasted the happy effects of

com <l> petition in the academic market place with the dismal state of

universities in which the professoriate was supported primarily by fixed

salaries.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#27:1> Such a method of payment, Smith argued, promoted idleness, and he

observed that <X> <quote> " [ i]n the university of Oxford, the greater part

of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even

the pretence of teaching" </quote> </X> ( I: 247; compare Reid, <quote> "

Statistical Account" </quote> 1: 229-31).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#28:1> Oxford also came in for some sharp criticism from another Glasgow

academic, George Jardine, who lectured on logic at the University from 1774

until his death in 1827.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#29:1> In his <it> Outlines of Philosophical Education </it> , Jardine

challenged the smug self-satisfaction of the apologists for the ancient seats

of learning south of the Tweed, and argued that the tutorial system employed

by the English and Irish universities stifled the intellectual development of

the young.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#30:1> Like Smith, Jardine underlined the beneficial effects of competition

or " emula <l> tion," and insisted that <quote> " all the faculties of the

mind are exerted, and powers unused before, are awakened into life and

activity" </quote> in the atmosphere of the ( Scottish) lecture hall ( 464).

</p> <fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-008#31:1> The French universities did not fare much better in the eyes of

the enlightened.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#32:1> While residing at La Fleche in 1735, David Hume remarked to an

English correspondent: <X> <quote> " As to a celebrated Professor, I do not

know, if there is such to be met with at present in any part of France,

especially for the Sciences, in which generally the French are much <}> <->

inferiour </-> <=> inferior </=> </}> to our own <}> <-> Countreymen </-> <=>

Countrymen </=> </}> " </quote> </X> ( Mossner 32).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#33:1> Smith too was critical, claiming in <it> The Wealth of Nations </it>

that the French universities illustrated the pernicious effects of

ecclesiastical and political control over academic appointments ( 2: 247-48).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#34:1> Predictably, Voltaire sniped at the universities as well.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#35:1> Like Gibbon, he associated them with monkishness and barbarism, and

Voltaire contrasted the professoriate ( as well as the Academicians of his

time) with <quote> " the true scholars shut up in their studies ... [ who]

have nearly all been persecuted" </quote> ( 274).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#36:1> But perhaps the most damning attack on French higher education came

in Jean D'Alembert's article <quote> " <indig> Coll&eacute;ge </indig> , "

</quote> in the third volume of the <it> <indig> Encyclop&eacute;die </indig>

</it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#37:1> For D'Alembert there took a very dim view of the benefits of a

college education: <X> <quote> <foreign> [ U]n jeune homme apr&egrave;s avoir

pass&eacute; dans un coll&egrave;ge dix ann&eacute;es, qu'on doit mettre au

nombre de plus pr&eacute;cieuses de sa vie, en sort, lorsqu'il a le mieux

employ&eacute; son tems, avec la connoissance tr&egrave;s-imparfaite d'une

langue morte, avec des pr&egrave;ceptes de Rh&egrave;torique & des principes

de Philosophie qu'il doit t&acircumflex;cher d'oublier; souvent avec une

corruption de moeurs dont l'alt&eacute;ration de la sant&eacute; est la

moindre suite; quelquefois avec des principes d'une d&eacute;votion

mal-entendue; mais plus ordinairement avec une connoissance de la Religion si

superficielle, qu'elle succombe &agrave; la premiere conversation impie, ou

&agrave; la premiere lecture dangereuse. </foreign> ( 635) </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-008#38:1> The <foreign> <it> philosophes </it> </foreign> on both sides of

the Channel were, therefore, largely hostile to traditional educational

institutions like Oxford or the various French universities, but were their

criticisms entirely just? </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#39:1> <h> II </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-008#40:1> In order to answer this question, I want to juxtapose the

intellectual record of Oxford and the French universities in the eighteenth

century as presented in the volumes under review, with that of their

counterparts in Scotland.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#41:1> For the assessments of Oxford and the French schools quoted above con

<l> trast markedly with contemporary perceptions of the Scottish colleges (

and not just those of the Scots themselves).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#42:1> Recent work on the cultural milieu of eighteenth-century Scotland has

shown that the universities of North Britain helped nurture the Scottish

Enlightenment, which is hardly sur <l> prising in view of the fact that such

leading lights as Joseph Black, William Cullen, Adam Ferguson, John Millar,

Thomas Reid, and Adam Smith were all members of the professoriate. <fnr> <sp>

2 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#43:1> There is little question that the Scots were, on the whole, quick to

assimilate new currents in the arts and sciences in <l> to their courses, and

hence their universities provide us with a standard of academic enlightenment

against which the developments in the cur <l> riculum in France and in Oxford

can be compared. <fnr> <sp> 3 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#44:1> Brockliss himself draws attention to the need for such a comparative

dimension when discussing the history of the curriculum, and in what follows

I shall engage in mapping the kind of <quote> " curricular topography of the

early-modern university" </quote> which he calls for ( Brockliss 448). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-008#45:1> Let us consider first the cultivation of classical learning.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#46:1> Although the <foreign> <it> philosophes </it> </foreign> are

sometimes seen as championing the cause of the moderns rather than that of

the ancients, they in fact generally subscribed to the common view that a

knowledge of the classics was necessary in the republic of letters.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#47:1> Gibbon, for example, went up to Oxford hoping to master Greek and

Latin, only to have his hopes shattered by the indifference of his tutors,

while D'Alembert claimed that Latin should be the language of philosophy (

Gibbon 30, 34-37; D'Alembert, <it> Preliminary Discourse </it> 93).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#48:1> Indeed, Peter Gay has argued that during the Enlightenment the

<foreign> <it> philosophes </it> </foreign> drew a good deal of inspiration

from the authors of pagan antiquity ( 2: 31-203).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#49:1> Some of Gay's claims may be difficult to document, but Brockliss's

findings at least corro <l> borate Gay's insistence on the centrality of the

classics in the <foreign> <it> Weltanschauung </it> </foreign> of the age,

for even though the teaching of Greek seems to have declined in France during

the second half of the eighteenth century, in the <foreign> <it> ancien

r&eacute;gime </it> </foreign> students spent a good deal of their six years

at university studying Latin.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#50:1> Furthermore, they were expected to become fluent speakers as well as

stylish writers, because Latin continued to be used as the language of

classroom instruction in virtually all of their courses.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#51:1> Similarly, at Oxford the classics formed the core of the formal

curriculum, though here too Greek became an increasingly marginal subject as

the century wore on, and the extent to which English displaced Latin in

lectures and tutorials is unclear ( Sutherland and Mitchell 513-33). </p>

<fnr> <sp> 4 </sp> </fnr>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-008#52:1> The classics fared somewhat differently in Scotland, in so far as

there was a revival of Greek scholarship in the early eighteenth century

which was linked to the philosophical and mathematical interests of men such

as Francis Hutcheson and his Glasgow colleague Robert Simson, and the study

of Latin occupied a subsidiary, though nonetheless important, place in the

curriculum of the Scottish universities. <fnr> <sp> 5 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#53:1> Thus students usually studied Latin and Greek most intensively at the

beginning of their course, and after their second year they switched their

attention primarily to mathematics, and to natural and moral philosophy.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#54:1> Moreover, from roughly the 1740s onwards their lectures were largely

in English, though Latin was often used on public occasions ( Reid, <it>

Philosophical Orations </it> ) .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#55:1> Of greater significance is the fact that the professors responsible

for instruction in Greek and Latin indulged in philosophical or historical

reflections on the materials they dealt with in their advanced classes, so

that their students were introduced to topics in political theory or to

conjectural history in the context of their classical studies ( Emerson

69-70).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#56:1> Consequently, the classical education received by students at the

Scottish universities was closer in character to that given in France, and

was probably more closely linked to the other branches of learning covered in

the curriculum than was the case at Oxford.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#57:1> Having completed their courses on the languages, literature, and

culture of the ancient world, students in eighteenth-century Scotland

normally proceeded to the heart of the curriculum, namely the study of moral

and natural philosophy.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#58:1> In <it> The Democratic Intellect </it> , George Davie contended that

the distinctive feature of the Scottish university system prior to the

Anglicising reforms of the nineteenth century was the philosophical focus of

undegraduate education.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#59:1> Subsquent research has largely confirmed Davie's intuitions, and

Brockliss's work, along with the relevant essays in the Oxford <it> History

</it> , serves to underline the contrast between the Scottish experience and

the patterns of instruction in France and at Oxford.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-008#60:1> In Scotland, the philosophy course typically encompassed what we

would now call the natural sciences and the sciences of man and socirty, so

that the arts student would commonly attend ( with minor variations) lectures

on mechanics, pneumatics, electricity and magnetism, optics, astronomy, the

philosophy of mind, logic, rhetoric, ethics, jurisprudence, and politics,

which would be supplemented by prelections on mathematics, and in some cases

on natural and civil history. </p> </I>
