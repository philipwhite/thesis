<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#3:1> My father's hobby was storms.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#4:1> He pursued them like other men chased women.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#5:1> Through the Ontario Weather Centre he'd find out about a storm coming

in from another province or from New York or Michigan and drive headlong into

it at 80 miles an hour with nothing more than a thermos of black coffee and a

couple of ham and cheese sand <l> wiches sitting beside him on the passenger

seat.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#6:1> Sometimes I'd hear him leave the house at three in the morning to

chase one down.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#7:1> He loved all types of severe weather: waterspouts, funnel clouds,

flooding downpours, hail storms, dust devils, and heat lightning.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#8:1> But above all he loved tornadoes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#9:1> Everyone at the Ontario Weather Centre knew my father.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#10:1> He used to phone in twice a day looking for reports of significant

weather gathering on the horizon or blowing in from the lakes, then race out

of the house like a man late for his own wedding.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#11:1> But he understood storms better than anyone, even better than the men

at the Centre.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#12:1> Although he was only an amateur storm watcher, the people at the

Weather Centre often ended up using his reports and eventually began to ask

his opinion concerning cer <l> tain storms, what one was doing, where it was

headed, how long it would last.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#13:1> In the strange cabal of significant weather watchers, my father was

quickly making a name for himself.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#14:1> And I wasn't far behind. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#15:1> My mother, on the other hand, did not care for storms.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#16:1> She wore her long brown hair done up in a bun, as if battened down

tightly against unexpected winds.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#17:1> She worked part-time at the local library organizing something she

called the Bear Pit.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#18:1> That was her thing.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#19:1> With the help of government subsidies, she brought in speakers from

around the province in an effort to enlighten our small com <l> munity.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#20:1> Poets, historians, parachute stunt jumpers, jugglers, race car

drivers.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#21:1> She decided who came, and each speaker was paid a stipend for his or

her trouble.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#22:1> It was a mix of artists and adventurers, personalities and nobodies.

<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#23:1> My father, who would have been an obvious choice, who could have

marvelled the unini <l> tiated with tales of storm hunting, never took the

lectern.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#24:1> My mother never asked him, and he never volunteered.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#25:1> In my father's failure to appear, the Bear Pit was where my parents

fought out their long, silent battle.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#26:1> Maybe that's why my mother called it what she did.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#27:1> I knew hunting storms was a sore spot between them, first because it

was a dangerous and crazy thing to be involved in, and later because severe

weather became as threatening to their mar <l> riage as an exotic woman who

stormed through town, staying just long enough to get my father to do

something rash or irresponsible. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#28:1> " This man climbed to the top of Mount Everest," my mother would

say, halfway through supper.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#29:1> A sidelong glance over to my father, the drifting smile that spread

over her face when she believed she had something that would finally capture

my interest. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#30:1> " The incredible thing is he's only got one arm.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#31:1> Can you imagine the kind of man it takes to do something like that!"
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#32:1> My father, though, tall and forward-leaning, would sit at the kitchen

table impassively, unimpressed, rolling his peas around on his plate with his

fork and plotting in his head the course of the nearest squall line or

reviewing statistics from the <it> Weekly Review of Canadian Climate and

Water </it> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#33:1> I accompanied my mother to many of the Bear Pit sessions.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#34:1> I lis <l> tened to the stories of a man who'd rolled across the

country in a wheelchair, a woman who kept more than 200 snakes in her base

<l> ment, the life story of a pair of Siamese twins, now separated, and a

distinguished professor talking about his newest book on the Louis Riel

uprising of 1869.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#35:1> But already, at the age of ten, storms were my passion.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#36:1> I knew the difference between bead lightning and ball lightning, and

that the scientific community was split on whether the latter actually

existed.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#37:1> My father had beaten my mother to me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#38:1> By the time I was 13 I knew more about storms than any science

teacher at my high school.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#39:1> I won first prize for my grade 9 Science Fair project when I produced

a contained tornado by joining two Coke bottles at the neck with a snipped

balloon end, one holding ten ounces of water.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#40:1> The clincher was when I rated my homemade storm on a miniaturized

Fujita F-scale, calculating the strength of my whirlwind and the damage in

real dollars that an equivalent full-scale tornado would bring to our small

town of Nobleton, Ontario.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#41:1> I knew that a tornado was called a <mention> " funnel cloud"

</mention> until it came to earth, that Ontario's hail season had begun on

schedule that same year when hail stones were reported at Cootes Paradise on

the fourteenth of March, and that it would probably last upwards of 170 days,

well into September. <O> photograph </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#42:1> I knew during our last severe weather season we'd had 29 tornadoes

across the province, concentrated into 14 storm days.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#43:1> During a severe weather season that lasted some 45 days, 14 tornado

days made for about a 30 per cent season.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#44:1> My father and I had witnessed seven. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#45:1> This year we were aiming for ten individual tornadoes, or roughly

a third of what the province could expect to experience in one sea <l> son.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#46:1> That meant sometimes seeing more than one tornado per day. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#47:1> Whatever points I gained in science class in those days, my

father and I lost at home with my mother.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#48:1> Although she insisted on taking me to her Bear Pit sessions all the

way up to grade 12, deep down inside I think she realized in whose footsteps

I would follow since the day my father took me to see my first tornado, when

I was six years old. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#49:1> " We've got sightings of funnels out near Tillsonburg," I remem

<l> ber him saying that afternoon as he wrote something in the pad of paper

he always kept with him.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#50:1> He'd just gotten off the phone with the Weather Centre, which had

been tracking a thunder storm for the last few hours.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#51:1> I remember looking out the window at the still trees across the

street, then at my mother.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#52:1> She was standing at the sink, scraping leftovers into a plastic

Tupperware dish.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#53:1> My father closed the note pad and slid his pencil behind his right

ear.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#54:1> " If we're lucky it'll turn into something serious and suck up a cow

or two," he said and winked at me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#55:1> My mother turned around and glared at him icily. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#56:1> As we drove west to Tillsonburg my father told me what I could

expect from a storm like the one we were heading into.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#57:1> He said if the funnel decided to touch down it would only be a baby

tornado.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#58:1> " Barely an F-0," he said, cryptically.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#59:1> As he spoke his eyes roamed the horizon, hoping, I knew, for airborne

material.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#60:1> Every 15 min <l> utes he radioed the Weather Centre with an update.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#61:1> " We might not see anything today.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#62:1> I should warn you.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#63:1> But they've got funnel sightings coming into the Centre.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#64:1> That's a good sign, at least.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#65:1> Tornadoes are finicky things."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#66:1> It seemed to me that he was trying to be upbeat. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#67:1> Between reports over the <smallcaps> cb </smallcaps> I learned

how less than one per cent of thunderstorms manifest themselves as tornadoes,

how all condi <l> tions have to be just right for one to form.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#68:1> I learned that the world-renowned meteorologist, Professor T.

Theodore Fujita, had just developed an ingenious system which helped predict

a tornado's potential destructiveness based on its wind speed.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#69:1> Backtracking, my father explained the Fujita system to me thoroughly,

interrupting himself now and then to ask if I had any questions.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#70:1> " No," I said and slowly poured him some black coffee from the

thermos, trying to remember all the things he'd just told me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#71:1> A gust of wind bumped the car ever so slightly, as if to lend weight

and credibility to my father's understanding of tornadoes, his explanation of

the heav <l> ens, and a hot black ribbon of coffee jumped into my lap from

the thermos spout. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#72:1> " What you can explain can't hurt you," he said as I handed him

the plastic thermos cup, the coffee spreading across my thigh.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#73:1> " There's nothing to be afraid of from a tornado if you know what

you're dealing with.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#74:1> <foreign> <quote> <it> In scientia est salus </it> </quote>

</foreign> ."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#75:1> He stopped talking and blew over his coffee.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#76:1> " I guess you know your mom doesn't approve of me bringing you out

here." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#77:1> " Is she mad at us?"
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#78:1> " No, she's not.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#79:1> But she's a girl," he said, " and girls don't under <l> stand the fun

stuff like storms." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#80:1> The afternoon turned black around four o'clock, and two miles

east of Delhi we pulled over to the side of the road and let the cen <l> tre

of a baby F-0 tornado pass over us. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#81:1> " Roll down your window," my father said excitedly.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#82:1> Newspapers and plastic bags whirled frantically around the car.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#83:1> A pickup truck and two other cars were pulled up onto the side of the

road, more storm hunters like my father.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#84:1> I rolled down the window and a gust of wind reached in and tousled my

hair, the way one of the Siamese twins at the Bear Pit had done after his

talk.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#85:1> Sand and grit blew over my face.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#86:1> " Stick out your hand," he said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#87:1> He had his window rolled down the same as mine.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#88:1> " You're touching it, Gordie!" he shouted.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#89:1> " You're shaking hands with a tornado!" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#90:1> After the tornado dissipated we got out of the car and talked to

the other storm watchers.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#91:1> I didn't understand much of what they said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#92:1> My knowledge of storms was still limited to what my father had told

me on our way there.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#93:1> I stood beside him, holding his hand while they compared notes.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#94:1> He knew them from other sight <l> ings.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#95:1> They all knew each other's names.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#96:1> My father offered around his coffee and sandwiches, and an old lady

from Bond Head cut a slice of chocolate cake for me, which I ate sitting on

the hood of our car.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#97:1> On our way home my father asked me again if I had any questions about

what we'd seen.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#98:1> Outside of Cambridge he pulled into a McDonald's and bought us each

an ice cream cone. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#99:1> " Guess what," I said to my mother when we got home a few hours

later.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#100:1> " We shook hands with the tornado."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#101:1> She had taken me upstairs and was giving me a bath. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#102:1> " You did no such thing," she said, scrubbing the grit and sand

from my ears. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#103:1> We were going to celebrate our tenth storm season together

chasing down severe weather by shooting for roughly a 30 per cent view rate.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#104:1> During our best season we'd managed barely 20 per cent, mostly F-0s.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#105:1> We'd have to make it to one in three tornadoes of the expected 30 or

so, not including waterspouts, dust devils, and funnel clouds.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#106:1> We were aiming high, but it was my last year at high school.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#107:1> I'd accelerated two grades and had already been accepted at the

University of Chicago to begin an undergrad that would lead me into

meteorology.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#108:1> Before going I would spend a year at the Pikes Peak synoptic weather

sta <l> tion in Colorado, 14,110 feet above sea level.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#109:1> I'd gotten an intern <l> ship there through my grade 13 physics

teacher, whose brother headed The National Meteorological Centre in Camp

Springs, Maryland.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#110:1> I would have a bird's eye view of the entire northwestern quarter of

the continent.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#111:1> After ten months I would leave for Chicago, where I hoped eventually

to study under the eminent meteorologist, Professor Fujita.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#112:1> A 30 per cent tornado view rate was going to be a triumphant <}> <->

sendoff </-> <+> send-off </+> </}> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-017#113:1> During the late spring of 1985, just before school got out, I

spent my lunch hours in the lab, working on some experiments I would develop

later at Chicago.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#114:1> On a Tuesday my father called the school from the nuclear power

station where he worked as a lab techni <l> cian. </I> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#X115:1> He had me paged over the <smallcaps> pa </smallcaps> , and I went

down to the office to take the call.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#X116:1> " Gordon," he said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#X117:1> The secretary was watching me out of the corner of her eye.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#X118:1> " We've got a serious squall line mov <l> ing in from the

southwest.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-017#X119:1> I think I'll suddenly develop a headache." </p> </X>
