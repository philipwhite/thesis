<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#1:1> <h> <bold> Minister, MLAs meet with European parliamentarians in

Vegreville, Alberta </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#2:1> The fur industry was the topic of conversation as three members of

the legislative assembly met with members of the Euro <l> pean parliament

last Wednesday. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#3:1> Renewable Resources Minister Titus Allooloo and MLAs Don Morin and

Peter Ernerk travelled to Vegreville, Alta., for one day.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#4:1> MLA John Ningark ( Natilikmeot) decided to stay in Yellowknife after

some members raised con <l> cerns about spending. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#5:1> Allooloo said pressure is mounting on Europeans to ban the leghold

trap, and they are not likely to change their position.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#6:1> A resolution to ban the import of wild furs to the European communi

<l> ty has been proposed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#7:1> " It's important to develop an acceptable alternative to the

leghold trap if we are to keep our trapping industry alive," Allooloo said on

his return. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#8:1> The European Parliamen <l> tary Members toured the trap research

centre in Vegreville on Wednesday and are planning to spend a day on a

trapline. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#9:1> Money for the <w> MLAs' </w> trip came from the renewable

resources departmental budget. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#10:2> <h> <bold> MLA objects to correction charge </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#11:2> It's not right that families must pay to change their misspelled

Inuit names to the correct spelling, says MLA Peter Ernerk ( Aivilik) </p> .

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#12:2> He told the legislative assembly the mistake is often made by

hospital workers who write down the baby's name.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#13:2> To change it to the original the territorial government charges about

&dollar;10.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#14:2> Officially changing the name must be done through the courts. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#15:2> " I would have thought, since it's not the fault of the family

for misspelling such a name, that either the hospital or the GNWT would be

responsible for the costs of spelling that name pro <l> perly," said Ernerk.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#16:2> Justice Minister Michael Ballantyne is looking into the matter.

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#20:3> The Keewatin Inuit Association accuses government leader Dennis

Patterson of not speaking up for the people on the pro <l> posed Kiggavik

uranium mine. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#21:3> <quote> " Which side are you on?" </quote> asks a Feb.16 letter

to Pat <l> terson sent by the KIA dur <l> ing its recent general assembly in

Rankin Inlet.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#22:3> <quote> " Perhaps you feel that our opposition ( to the mine) has

been so strong that a rejec <l> tion of the proposal is a foregone

conclusion?" </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#24:3> " We have heard influen <l> tial political figures argue that the

real decision will be made at the highest levels in Ottawa, not by the FEARO

panel." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#25:3> The letter charges that government silence leads to the

conclusion that a back <l> room deal has already been made. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#26:3> One of the influential political figures referred to is W.J.

Stephen, director general of DIAND's N.W.T. region Northern Affairs Pro <l>

gram, who predicted in a confidential memo that the mine would go ahead. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#27:3> But Patterson distanced himself from those com <l> ments by

writing the KIA that Stephen's opinions were his own.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#28:3> Patterson said no territorial employee who spoke to Stephen took any

position on whether the mine would be approved by Ottawa or not. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#29:3> He further added that the territorial government would wait until

after seeing the Federal Environmental Assessment Review Office report before

taking a stand. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#30:3> " The people of the Keewatin have clearly ex <l> pressed

themselves as be <l> ing against this project," Keewatin Inuit Association

president Louis Pilakapsi told <it> News/North </it> through an interpreter.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#31:3> " They deserve to have their concerns represented by their

government.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#32:3> It's the lack of leadership by the territorial government in

representing them that is itself an issue." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#33:3> Pilakapsi says it was understandable for Patter <l> son to remain

silent in the early stages of the debate over the project for fear he might

be seen as imposing his own views.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#34:3> But now Pilakapsi says it's time for the voters to impose their views

on politicians and de <l> mand a policy that reflects their concerns. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#35:3> He also takes exception to Patterson's statement that the

decision will be a federal one made on federal land. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#36:3> " This is Inuit land," he says. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#37:3> The KIA has asked that the FEARO hearings be put off until at

least next September until all submis <l> sions and documents relating to the

proposed mine are translated and cir <l> culated to communities in the

region. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#38:3> Pilakapsi says Keewatin residents would have had better access to

translation of documents if the GNWT had been backing them. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#39:3> One government has decided to take a position on Kiggavik - at

the municipal level.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#40:3> The Hamlet of Baker Lake will hold a plebiscite to give its council

to deal specifically with environmental impurities. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#43:4> A contaminants unit of the department was an <l> nounced by

minister of health Nellie Cournoyea in the legislative assembly last week.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#46:5> MLA Peter Ernerk wants to know what the govern <l> ment is going

to do with hazardous tailings from an old mine site in Rankin Inlet. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#47:5> A special technical com <l> mittee has been establish <l> ed,

says municipal and community affairs minister Tom Butters. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#48:5> He says the short-term solution was to flood the area and put up

signs, but that will only work until spring comes and the ice melts. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#49:5> The committee will be making recommendations. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#50:5> <h> <bold> Traditional role of elders </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#51:5> Elders may be asked to sit on a panel as justices of the peace in

their com <l> munities.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#52:5> They may also sit on a panel with a territorial judge. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#53:5> It would be started on a pilot project basis, says Justice

Minister Michael Ballantyne, to assess com <l> munity acceptance of the new

approach. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#54:5> " This would recognize the traditional role of elders in the

aboriginal culture," says Ballantyne. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#55:5> <h> <bold> Freight subsidy possible </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#56:5> Work is being done on a freight subsidy program for the N.W.T.,

says Gordon Wray, the minister of transportation.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#57:5> He was answering a question from Hay River MLA John Pollard. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#58:5> Wray says there are many examples of sub <l> sidies across the

country, like reduced rates on St. Lawrence Seaway through the Canadian

Coastguard.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#59:5> Alberta is also subsidized by a Crown corporation that gives freight

subsidies to remote areas. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#60:5> " It's my goal to table the transportation strategy before the

end of the ses <l> sion," says Wray, adding that it still has to go through

cabinet committees and a final draft. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#61:5> <h> <bold> Shark skins </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#62:5> Nets which cost fisher <l> men &dollar;300 to &dollar;400 are con

<l> stantly being destroyed by sharks, says MLA Ipeelee Kilabuk.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#63:5> " Is there any com <l> mercial use for them?" he asked. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#64:5> Ecomonic Minister Gor <l> don Wray says they have run into

several problems with the sale of shark meat: the mercury level in the flesh

is too high for Cana <l> dian standards, the flesh contains a toxin from

pelagic snails which are part of their diet, and the market is tightly

controlled in the United States and Europe by a cartel. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#65:5> The GNWT will introduce drying and salting techni <l> ques to

fishermen this year to reduce the weight and shipping cost. </p> </I>

</h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#67:6> Canadian Press

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#68:6> Lack of appropriate data will make it difficult to find whether

there's a link between childhood leukemia and chlorine levels in the city's

drinking water, says a cancer researcher. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#69:6> Michelle Deschamps of the Cancer Control Agency of British

Columbia is completing a study that includes a look into the high incidence

of childhood leukemia in Kamloops. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#70:6> " We have requested from the city the total amount of

chlorination and chloride residual ... but the data is only available for

recent years," Deschamps said from Vancouver. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#71:6> The agency is probing factors from 1956 to 1988 that could have

contributed to a leukemia rate double the provincial average, she said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#72:6> Research at England's Newcastle University shows children who

drink water with low levels of chlorine are less likely to get acute

lymphatic leukemia than children who drink water that is more heavily

chlorinated. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#73:6> But gathering and analysing the appropriate data in Kamloops has

been a problem, says Deschamps. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#74:6> Kamloops health officials say they consider the city's supply

from the South Thompson River a good raw quality. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#75:7> <h> <bold> Anti-abortionists applauded </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#76:7> <h> But jailed protestors subdued </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#77:7> By JOANNE MacDONALD

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#78:7> A group of subdued but unapolo <l> getic anti-abortionists were

applauded by about 50 placard-car <l> rying supporters as they entered jail

in Burnaby Friday to complete their intermittent sentences on

contempt-of-court charges. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#79:7> The nine anti-abortionists were among 13 persons sentenced last

year for violating an injunction issued by B.C. Supreme Court Jus <l> tice

Lloyd McKenzie that prohibited the blockading of the Everywoman's Health

Centre. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#80:7> Four of the 13 were labelled lead <l> ers and sentenced to 24

days in jail, while the remaining nine were given 15-day terms. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#81:7> They were all ordered to pay all of the clinic's legal costs and

also placed on one year's probation. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#82:7> Those serving their sentences in the Lower Mainland Regional Cor

<l> rectional Centre, or in the case of women, the Lakeside Correctional

Centre, included Right to Life Society president Betty Green; Father Vincent

Hawkswell, editor of the B.C. Catholic; Rev. Donald Spratt; John Hof;

Christine Hendrix; Michael Hachey; Stephen Thomas; Lane Walker and Roy Lange.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#83:7> Meanwhile, Rev. Gregory Bitgood and Bruce Heslop of Kelowna, Gene

<l> vieve Ring of Kamloops and Eugene Schmunk of Nelson were scheduled to

complete their sentences in their local lock-ups. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#84:7> Before going to jail, Hof told reporters that despite the jail

terms, " there hasn't been any real progress.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#85:7> The unborn are still unprotected in Canada." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#86:7> " I know we've done the right thing.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#87:7> It's just that the impact hasn't been what we anticipated." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#88:7> " I think we've had a positive influence among the Christian com

<l> munity, further to that we've abso <l> lutely no help from government, no

help from ... well we've just been criticized roundly for being radical

fanatics." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#89:7> He is not sure he would risk fur <l> ther incarceration by

attempting to blockade the clinic because the max <l> imum sentence of six

months in jail and

$2,000 fine is " atrocious," Hof said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#90:7> Christine Hendrix, who has been incarcerated on three separate

offences, said she feels the jail sen <l> tences have made many people angry

because " we're being put in jail for trying to save unborn chil <l> dren.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#91:7> I'm sure they can see the injustice of it." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#92:7> Green said efforts must be concen <l> trated on preventing the

govern <l> ment from passing its proposed aboriton legislation. </p> <O> rest

<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#93:8> <h> <bold> Ballard fight: Yolanda out in last round </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#94:8> By WENDY COX

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#95:8> TORONTO - The longtime live-in companion of Harold Ballard has

lost her bid to take control of the guardianship of the ailing hockey

magnate. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#96:8> A judge who had declared Ballard mentally incompetent earlier in

the week ruled Friday that four guard <l> ians recommended by his daughter

look after the personal and financial interests of the 86-year-old multi <l>

millionaire. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#97:8> " I am now certain with the orders made he will be able to live

in dig <l> nity and peace for as long as he needs help," his daughter, Mary

Elizabeth Flynn, said as she left the courthouse. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#98:8> Yolanda Ballard, 57, who lived with Harold for most of the 1980s

and took his name though they never married, lost on all counts in the latest

battle with his children. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#99:8> District Court Judge Donna Haley appointed former Supreme Court

of Canada justice Willard Estey to look after the personal affairs of the

owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Maple Leaf Gardens. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#100:8> Reached at his Toronto office, Estey refused to comment immedia

<l> tely, saying: " I'm as busy as a one-armed paperhanger with the itch."

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#101:8> Named to look after Ballard's business affairs were Gardens

direc <l> tors Steve Stavro and Donald Giffen, and Donald Crump, who recently

resigned as Gardens secret <l> ary-treasurer to become commis <l> sioner of

the Canadian Football League. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#102:8> " It should have been quite clear to Yolanda Ballard that she

couldn't be a committee ( guardian) of the person - that it had to be someone

independent of Mr. Ballard's estate and his person," Haley said in announcing

her ruling. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#103:8> " There is also no evidence before me of her personal

capabilities of managing an estate as complex as Mr. Ballard's." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#104:8> Yolanda, who remained stoic as the judge read her decision

follow <l> ing three days of hearings, refused today to say whether she would

appeal but spat more venomous remarks at the Ballard children, with whom she

has openly feuded for years. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#105:8> The fiery blonde called son Bill Ballard " Cyclops William" and

Flynn " Medusa Mary". </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-004#106:8> " At the eleventh hour, everyone comes to jump on Harold's

coffin when he's not even in it yet," she said angrily, referring to

Ballard's children.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-004#107:8> Son Harold Jr. was also involved in the court action initiated by

his sister. </p> <O> rest of article </O> </I>
