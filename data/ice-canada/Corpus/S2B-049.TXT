<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-049#1:1:A> She concludes with a quotation from Donna Haraway's essay A

Manifesto <}> <-> of of Cyber </-> <=> for Cyborgs </=> </}> and thus makes

explicit her association of the aesthetic project of cyberpunk and the

political project of what she terms postmodern feminism
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#2:1:A> She concludes <quote> cyborg unities are monstrous and illegitimate

</quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#3:1:A> <O> quote continues </O> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#4:1:A> There are however extremely good reasons to be sceptical of the

alliance wrought by Hollinger <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#5:1:A> First <,> cyberpunk is an almost exclusively a male domain
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#6:1:A> In the words of Pat Murphy an award winning author of feminist

science fiction speaking on a women's panel on the status of science fiction

today she writes or said at the time that cyberpunk is <quote> largely a <w>

boys' </w> club </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#7:1:A> And a quick rundown of the major cyberpunk authors would reveal such
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#8:1:A> Uh the names <}> <-> are </-> <=> run from </=> </}> Gibson to

Sterling from K W Jeter Lewis Shiner uhm Joseph Shirley uh largely all men

and with <}> <-> the </-> <=> perhaps the </=> </}> only major exception of

the recent novel by Pat Cadigan called Sinners which has just come out <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#9:1:A> A second reason for scepticism is the fact that cyberpunk's interest

in demonstrating the permeability of the human body does not ultimately

displace or even volatize what <?> are </?> sorry volatize the category of

man rather the masculinist domination of a feminized virtual reality
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#10:1:A> It's a long phrase that I will sketch out further later on
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#11:1:A> The masculinist domination of a feminized virtual reality in

Gibson's Neuromancer represents what Arther Kroker describes as the <quote>

hyperinfusion of power by a male sex which seeks to hide the privileging of

the phallocentric gaze by theorizing the disappearance of its power into

seduction </quote> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#12:1:A> It is my contention that much of cyberpunk's problematization of

the humanist subject and the real simulation opposition inscribes an acute

anxiety of male displacement even as it heralds the age of homo datum <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#13:1:A> The electronic space which at once threatens male power while

simultaneously offering new opportunities for dominance is called cyberspace

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#14:1:A> In Gibson's novel it refers to the quote <quote> consensual

hallucination </quote> experienced by computer operators that the network

that they work in is a separate geographical space an imaginary realm of pure

information which can be accessed through a set of electrodes placed at the

temples
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#15:1:A> What happens is the computer operator puts this headband on ah

closes his eyes and upon opening his eyes he is entered into <}> <-> this

</-> <=> this </=> </}> inner world that's at once an extension <}> <-> of

his </-> <=> of his </=> </}> own mind
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#16:1:A> The console operator loses contact with empirical reality and opens

an inner eye on vistas of data
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#17:1:A> <quote> Looks out upon </quote> this is a quotation from

Neuromancer <quote> the steeped scarlet pyramid of the eastern seaboard

fishing authority burning beyond the green cubes of Mitsubishi Bank of

America and high and very far away the spiral arms of military systems

forever beyond reach </quote> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#18:1:A> Neuromancer is <,> to many the first and last word in the cyberpunk

genre
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#19:1:A> It is for Hollinger <quote> the C P limit test </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#20:1:A> C P for <mention> cyberpunk </mention> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#21:1:A> Its hero is a console cowboy that's what these hackers are called

<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#22:1:A> Case is one of <}> <-> the </-> <=> an </=> </}> elite group of

<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#23:1:A> Console cowboys are the lone bandits of a society in which

this
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#26:2:A> <quote> The sewer is the conscience of the city </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#27:2:A> <O> quote continues </O> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#28:2:A> This is from Victor Hugo Les Mis&eacute;rables <,> eighteen

sixty-two
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#29:2:A> On August the seventeenth nineteen fifty-two a few <}> <-> <}> <->

<.> y </.> </-> <+> years </+> </}> </-> <=> weeks </=> </}> before I entered

my last year of high school I bought Victor Hugo's massive novel Les

Mis&eacute;rables <,> the English edition one thousand two hundred and

twenty-two pages long published in nineteen thirty-one by the Modern Library

of the World's Best Book The Giant Series translated by Charles E Wilbur
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#30:2:A> That same summer I worked on the construction crew that was laying

the first water and sewer mains under the streets of <@> Creighton </@> the

town where I lived
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#31:2:A> I was seventeen
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#32:2:A> <@> Creighton </@> population eight hundred had of course no

bookstore
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#33:2:A> Neither did nearby Lethbridge population twenty-two thousand
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#34:2:A> But sometime earlier I had discovered that the stationery store on

Seventh Street South did offer a back corner with a few world classics
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#35:2:A> None of which had ever been written in Canada of course <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#36:2:A> In December nineteen fifty-one I had bought my first book there

Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens and I spent all of Christmas Day except

the compulsory Sunday morning uh church service <,> morning uh lying on the

living room couch laughing myself into fits <,> until my mother whose gift to

me the book was decided she had made a mistake in letting me choose it <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#37:2:A> She had had no choice
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#38:2:A> I wanted a book for Christmas and she could not read English
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#39:2:A> But <,> to waste an entire serious holiday laughing <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#40:2:A> Fortunately I was a fast reader though enjoyment and coughing

slowed me down on this one <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#41:2:A> But Les Mis&eacute;rables was no novel of laughter and forgetting
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#42:2:A> Not even in a brilliant windy southern Alberta summer Sunday <,> of

the early fifties
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#43:2:A> Nor can the present world tour musical version of that story make

it that <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#44:2:A> As Hugo states in his nineteen sixty-two preface the book deals

with <,,> <quote> the degradation of man by poverty the ruin of women by

starvation and the dwarfing of childhood by physical and spiritual night

</quote> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#45:2:A> Now the fact is that most modern Canadians like myself are

immeasurably fortunate
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#46:2:A> Not one of these conditions has ever really applied to us
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#47:2:A> Nevertheless <,,> in July nineteen ninety-one when I walked along

the beautiful streets of present-day <@> Creighton </@> I remember the deep

trenches that piled up the earth here in <?> pyramidal </?> rows thirty-nine

years ago <,> the sewers that surely still lie where I helped place them and

I also think of the hero of Les Mis&eacute;rables Jean Valjean <,> carrying

his <,> unconscious enemy <,,> with such ineffable honour through the immense

leviathan sewers <,> of eighteen thirty Paris <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#48:2:A> <quote> To descend into the sewer <,,> is to enter the grave

</quote> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#49:2:A> Now anyone in their right minds knows that the prairie town is <,>

not Paris France
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#50:2:A> Such knowledge is particularly obvious to those who year after year

live in such a town
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#51:2:A> The main irrigation ditch which still marks the southern boundary

of <@> Creighton </@> does not run through the middle of it like the Seine

through Paris <,> that ditch <,> which then watered all the gardens and the

small strawberry patches and corn and bean fields which filled every cistern

filled <,> under and beside every tiny wooden house through an intricate web

of overgrown ditches <,> supposedly <}> <-> clept clear </-> <=> kept clear

</=> </}> of weeds and wading widdling children by the one hired town worker

who was all <}> <-> of the </-> <=> at the </=> </}> same time the constable

the volunteer fire chief the dog catcher the wooden sidewalk repairman and

the waterman <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#52:2:A> That ditch of reverse tributaries was certainly no Seine River <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#53:2:A> The glazed clay and the much larger concrete sewer pipes <,> which

the workers of Bennett and White Limited Edmonton nested in the sand fitted

together and buried beneath the streets <,> in nineteen fifty-two were

nothing at all like the legendary architectured Paris sewers begun somewhere

in the middle ages and which in the nineteenth century had become both a

grave <,> and an asylum for crime intelligent social protest liberty of

conscience and every conceivable human debauchery as Hugo writes <quote> day

and night </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#54:2:A> I know personally that most of the <@> Creighton </@> sewers were

too small even for a child to crawl into <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#55:2:A> Not a single one of them was then large enough <,> for a big man to

walk in erect and leave alone carry another <,> draped over his shoulder <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#56:2:A> And I at seventeen was certainly <}> <-> no </-> <=> no </=> </}>

Bruneseau <,> who in <,> eighteen oh five would be the one man in all of

Napoleon's empire brave enough to enter the Paris sewers and then spend seven

years expanding their network
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#57:2:A> In fact <,> when I was hired on the first day of the <@> Creighton

</@> project <,> in less than two months before it was completed I was fired

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#58:2:A> Like everyone else <,> Bennett and White hired in <@> Creighton

</@> <,> I was a labourer a grunt <,,> <?> when our </?> work was mostly

fitting and carrying things of digging them up or burying them in places

designated by the foreman and various bosses <}> <-> all who came </-> <=>

all of whom came </=> </}> from somewhere else
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#59:2:A> A nice brainless business being a grunt
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#60:2:A> You just do everything anyone orders you because you're right down

there at the bottom with the sewer pipe as low as you'll get without more

digging which you'll have to do yourself <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#61:2:A> I however was a shade less grunty than most <,> for some reason
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#62:2:A> Because I could read and write
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#63:2:A> I <,> can't remember anyone having asked me to demonstrate it
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#64:2:A> On the very first day the project engineer pointed at me and the

<?> fat </?> foreman said you go with him
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#65:2:A> So there I was frequently without a shovel <,> riding about town

<,> in the engineer's brown Model A Ford
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#66:2:A> A curiosity even then
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#67:2:A> The rod and chain man <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#68:2:A> While my fellow grunts heaved sand and gravel and cement into the

grinding maw of a mixer <,> or backfilled around pipe deep in the trench <,>

or muscled clay joints and concrete manholes sectioned <?> above </?> the

trucks I held a graduated stick motionless <,> or anchored what I at first

supposed was an endless measuring tape <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#69:2:A> Hold it right there
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#70:2:A> Don't move it
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#71:2:A> But quickly discovered it was a chain <,> a steel chain certainly

<,> but nothing at all like the one riveted around Jean Valjean's neck <,> to

march him to the prison galleys of Toulon <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#72:2:A> If my life were a <,> <}> <-> <.> m </.> </-> <=> <,> massive </=>

</}> romance like Les Mis&eacute;rables where everyone especially the

villains always and continuously return <,> until all are either dead or

married <,> which in most romances not Hugo's <}> <-> is </-> <=> amounts

</=> </}> to the same thing I would by now have met that engineer again <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#73:2:A> Perhaps five years older than I a third year civil engineering

student at the University of Alberta on his summer job <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#74:2:A> His blond tough and compact body shorter than mine
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#75:2:A> His slightly lopsided grin with a tooth missing on the right side

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#76:2:A> But I cannot remember his name <,> nor will he remember the gangly

kid he left to lounge in the shade of his Model A while the other grunts

sweated and gasped in the burning sun and he argued with the foreman
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#77:2:A> I didn't lounge often for within two days I had learned the grunt's

basic survival rules
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#78:2:A> One
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#79:2:A> Never sit down <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#80:2:A> Two
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#81:2:A> Never stand with your hands in your pockets <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#82:2:A> But often the engineer did not need me and then I worked with the

rest and that was when the others who were never told to sit in the Model A

got their small revenges on me
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#83:2:A> The heavy ends of the pipes
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#84:2:A> The extra shovelling where there was room for only one to work
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#85:2:A> The deepest mud after a rain <,> when the huge planks <?> supported

<?> the trench <,> <?> walls </?> oozed and bulged ominously between their

horizontal braces <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#86:2:A> <quote> He was wading <,> in the hideous muck of the city all

dripping with slime </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#87:2:A> <O> quote continues </O> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#88:2:A> The best trench workers quickly proved to be the older immigrant

men who had somehow survived the war and had managed with what was left of

their families to get into Canada <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#89:2:A> Those were the refugees <,> displaced persons or D Ps as they were

<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#90:2:A> They worked at anything without question <,>

them from its pervasive abusive tone
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#92:2:A> That racism bothered me <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#93:2:A> Mostly to be honest about it for myself <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#94:2:A> After all though born in Canada I was of refugee parents myself
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#95:2:A> At home we had never spoken but an obscure German dialect <,> a

language I used to explain the foreman's peremptory orders to my fellow <,>

Mennonite D P labourers <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#96:2:A> But tired muscles and common sweat soon pushed such attitudes in a

work gang aside <,>

<ICE-CAN:S2B-049#98:2:A> It seems to me now that thinking back to that nineteen fifty-two

prejudice about race <,,>
