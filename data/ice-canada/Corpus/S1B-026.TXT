<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#1:1> It's now nine minutes to one o'clock
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#2:1> You're listening to Radio Noon
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#3:1> My name is <@> Denise Storey </@>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#4:1> It is fourteen degrees in a wet Montreal right now
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#5:1> Now we have the business panel <,> and uh you can guess of course what

has still dominated the business news news everywhere really still and that's

the <mention> r </mention> word
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#6:1> <@> May Niven </@> is a reporter with the Globe and Mail's Report on

Business
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#7:1> <@> Wayne Lewis </@> is a business columnist with the Montreal Gazette
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#8:1> Hello to both of you

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#9:1:B> <{1> <[1> Hi </[1>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#10:1:B> <{2> <[2> We survived it <O> laugh </O> somehow <O> laugh </O>

</[2>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#11:1:C> <[1> Hi <O> laugh </O> </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#12:1:A> <[2> Do you spit though </[2> </{2>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#13:1:A> <}> <-> Like </-> <=> Like </=> </}> Lucien Bouchard's little boys

do <,> spit

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#14:1:B> <{> <[> Referendum <&> spoken like a growl </&> </[>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#15:1:C> <[> Yeah <O> laugh </O> </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#16:1:A> <[> <X> spitting noises </X> </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#17:1:A> <O> laugh </O> How has business reacted to this <{> <[> just a

astounding week </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#18:1:B> <[> Well </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#19:1:B> <}> <-> It's </-> <=> It's </=> </}> funny uh you know
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#20:1:B> Some of the things that happen in business are so short-term that

<}> <-> they're </-> <=> they're </=> </}> funny
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#21:1:B> Uhm on Tuesday morning the TSE <&> Toronto Stock Exchange </&> just

shot up into the stratosphere
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#22:1:B> Uhm the dollar went way up
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#23:1:B> The bank rate fell and prime rate fell too
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#24:1:B> The last two things are pretty darn good for consumers
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#25:1:B> But this by no means was as we know a definitive vote and business

is still absolutely uhm <,> paralyzed by what to do by this
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#26:1:B> And in many senses they are literally paralyzed
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#27:1:B> Uhm <}> <-> we </-> <=> we </=> </}> talked about Matrox before the

electronics company in the west island
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#28:1:B> It was going to shelve an expansion plan altogether if the yes side

won
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#29:1:B> The no side won <,> but it's not going fully ahead with that

expansion plan
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#30:1:B> <}> <-> It </-> <=> It </=> </}> doesn't know how much of it it

will do <,> but it certainly knows it's going to farm out some of its r and d

activities to uh Florida where <}> <-> they all have </-> <=> they already

have </=> </}> a small presence
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#31:1:B> There's just uncertainty right left and centre
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#32:1:B> Especially in light <,> of Parizeau's resignation and uh Lucien

Bouchard's uh <,> contemplation over his fate

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#33:1:C> Matrox is a very good example of what is going on in the small

and medium size business community
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#34:1:C> You have to make a sort of distinction because <,> if you speak to

economists about what's going to happen to the economy as a whole <,> uh they

tend to believe uh whichever way their sympathies lie that uh <,> the economy

will get back <}> <-> on a </-> <=> on an </=> </}> even keel <,> pretty fast
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#35:1:C> A very large part of Quebec's industry uh is made up for example of

resource industries and it's very very difficult to pick up a vein of gold

and move it out of Quebec
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#36:1:C> Uhm <{> <[> so things like that </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#37:1:B> <[> Heavy <O> laugh </O> </[> </{>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#38:1:C> Things like yeah very heavy
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#39:1:C> Things like that <}> <-> won't </-> <=> won't </=> </}> be very

much affected uh and they probably wouldn't be too severely affected even if

Quebec were indeed to go ahead and separate some day
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#40:1:C> But the growth in Quebec's economy and the new jobs in Quebec's

economy come from the small and medium size business sector which include a

lot of high tech businesses and a lot of service businesses
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#41:1:C> So Matrox is a good example of those businesses uh and other very

large uh uh business the apparel business which depends uh on Ontario and the

rest of Canada for eighty or ninety percent of its sales
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#42:1:C> And businesses like that <,,> aren't <,> ready to pack up their

bags and leave
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#43:1:C> Although at least a few of them are doing that
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#44:1:C> There's a company called Milton Funwear we may have mentioned

before <{1> <[1> <}> <-> that </-> <=> that </=> </}> </[1> they've had it

with the
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#45:1:C> <{2> <[2> uncertainty </[2> and even with the no they said they

were moving

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#46:1:A> <[1> Uhm yes </[1> </{1>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#47:1:A> <[2> Uhm hmm </[2> </{2>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#48:1:C> There are other businesses that are just saying well you know

we're going to go ahead
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#49:1:C> We're going to stay here but we're going to be very cautious and

we're going to put what investment we can outside Quebec because we want to

hedge our bets
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#50:1:C> So <}> <-> I think that </-> <=> I think that </=> </}> <}> <->

we've </-> <=> we've </=> </}> shot ourselves in the foot and we're going to

suffer <}> <-> a <.> ser </.> </-> <=> a long term and serious </=> </}> <{>

<[> loss of job creation </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#51:1:B> <[> And it's </[> </{> it's not just uhm investors with hard

assets factories and so on
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#52:1:B> Uhm we've got money managers that are really <}> <-> important </->

<=> an important </=> </}> part of the Canadian and the Quebec economy these

uhm managers who uh have a lot of investors <}> <-> from </-> <=> from </=>

</}> overseas and so on
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#53:1:B> They're not sure what to do about Canadian equities
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#54:1:B> They're very doubtful about Quebec equities
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#55:1:B> We saw Morgan Stanley being very very skittish on uh Canadian

equities
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#56:1:B> And uh a lot of fund managers are simply not sure about what to do
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#57:1:B> So we've got that aspect and a lot of uhm foreign investors hold

Canadian and Quebec debt so that has lots of implications
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#58:1:B> All of these factors that we're talking about have a lot of

implications <}> <-> for </-> <=> for </=> </}> Quebec's books <,> its public

finances which are in a very messy state
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#59:1:B> Uhm the deficit was five point seven billion for nineteen

ninety-four ninety-five
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#60:1:B> It's anybody's guess as to whether targets for this fiscal year can

be met
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#61:1:B> <{1> <[1> Especially with </[1>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#62:1:B> <{2> <[2> the possibility </[2> of taxpayers leaving and companies

leaving

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#63:1:A> <[1> But that <,> that's a huge question </[1> </{1>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#64:1:C> <[2> Well </[2> </{2> <}> <-> I'll </-> <=> I'll </=> </}>

give you my bet
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#65:1:C> My bet would be very strongly that they will not be met
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#66:1:C> Uh Quebec blew its uh its projections last year by a billion

dollars or something
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#67:1:C> I'd be sure that they are going to blow their projections this year

uh by maybe not that much but by a very large amount
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#68:1:C> Uh Ontario has already had to make massive additional cuts on top

of the initial Harris cuts <,> because they were running hundreds of millions

<}> <-> of </-> <=> of </=> </}> dollars behind on their revenues because the

economy's been slow
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#69:1:C> How much slower has it been in Quebec

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#70:1:A> I'd like to
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#71:1:A> I would like to move on <}> <-> get </-> <=> put </=> </}> the

referendum behind us <{1> <[1> cos I mean the truth is </[1>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#72:1:A> <{2> <[2> I would like to but I can't </[2>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#73:1:C> <[1> Wouldn't we all <O> laugh </O> </[1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#74:1:B> <[1> Oh really <O> laugh </O> </[1> </{1>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#75:1:B> <[2> We want to talk about it endlessly <,> forever and ever </[2>

</{2>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#76:1:C> We're not obsessed

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#77:1:A> Let's talk about <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> phone

companies
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#78:1:A> <}> <-> They're </-> <=> They're </=> </}> mad

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#79:1:C> <{1> <[1> They're mad yeah <O> laugh </O> </[1>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#80:1:C> <{2> <[2> Ma Bell is mad </[2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#81:1:B> <[1> One company is <O> laugh </O> </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#82:1:B> <[2> Mad as hell and not going to take it anymore <O> laugh

</O> </[2> </{2>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#83:1:C> <{> <[> You don't want to make Ma Bell mad I guess <O> laugh

</O> </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#84:1:A> <[> Mad as Bell <O> laugh </O> </[> </{>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#85:1:C> <{> <[> Oh oh <O> laugh </O> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#86:1:B> <[> Good one <O> laugh </O> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#87:1:A> But what's the story

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#88:1:B> Well <}> <-> the local </-> <=> the C R T C </=> </}> said

that local phone rates are allowed to rise by four dollars a month over the

next two years
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#89:1:B> That's two dollars each year
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#90:1:B> And then there's going to be some sort of unknown increase as of

January nineteen ninety-eight
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#91:1:B> January first nineteen ninety-eight
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#92:1:B> And long distance rates would fall by an <}> <-> <.> equiv </.>

</-> <+> equivalent </+> </}> amount for most uh most consumers
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#93:1:B> Uh what Bell <}> <-> is </-> <=> is </=> </}> upset about is that

<}> <-> it </-> <=> it's </=> </}> still going to be regulated in the long

distance market
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#94:1:B> And it says <quote> well why shouldn't competition simply prevail

<X>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#X95:1:B> Why do we have to go to the C R T C and get our rates approved and

go through lengthy hearings and so on </X> </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#96:1:B> It thinks that there's just an unfair advantage especially by big

American companies
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#97:1:B> It feels very threatened by the <}> <-> <.> on </.> </-> <+>

onslaught </+> </}> of A T and T and so on and some of the big heavyweights

south of the border

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#98:1:A> Uhm
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#99:1:A> They're still making money hand over fist aren't they

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#100:1:B> Oh yeah <O> laugh </O>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#101:1:C> <}> <-> They're </-> <=> They're </=> </}> making money hand

over fist if you look at the total number of dollars that they're making
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#102:1:C> If you look at the total numbers of dollars they're making in

relation to the amount of investment they have in their company <,> I don't

think that their profits are that impressive
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#103:1:C> Uh and that's what they always like to look at
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#104:1:C> But you know when your making a billion dollars a year <}> <-> or

</-> <=> or </=> </}> something like that <,> it's very difficult to uh to

get a sympathetic hearing for that kind of a complaint

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#105:1:A> Uhm

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#106:1:C> There is another aspect to this which is that uh what the C R

T C is aiming at in the long run uh almost everybody uh who knows the

industry <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> has studied it believes is

probably a good thing
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#107:1:C> It's competition <,> both in the long distance field and in the

local field
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#108:1:C> <{> <[> Uh it's kind of </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#109:1:A> <[> But is there any competition in the local field </[> </{>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#110:1:C> Absolutely none right now but there are cable companies that

have wires to almost everyone's home
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#111:1:C> It would not be inconceivable for them to start up a parallel

phone system
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#112:1:C> And indeed they've done that in some places like in the United

Kingdom
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#113:1:C> In fact uh Videotron uh <{> <[> runs one of those competitve phone

services </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#114:1:A> <[> Right in the U K yeah </[> </{>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#115:1:C> <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> would love to see competition

because I would love to be able to fire my local cable company
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#116:1:C> And maybe I'd fire Bell too if they couldn't offer competitive uh

uh phone rates
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#117:1:C> Maybe I'd just switch around

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#118:1:B> But the government the federal government has said it is

committed to competition in all of these different areas of

telecommunications cable and telephones and so on
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#119:1:B> So uh maybe we're seeing it uh put its money where its mouth is

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#120:1:A> Uhm
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#121:1:A> What's the unemployment rate
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#122:1:A> We have figures <{> <[> <unclear> word </unclear> </[>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#123:1:C> <[> Yeah the unemployment rate </[> </{> has done one of <}>

<-> its </-> <=> the </=> </}> kind of contradictory things it does sometimes
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#124:1:C> The news looks bad because it went up by two-tenths of a

percentage point uh in Canada and I think three-tenths of a percentage point

in Quebec
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#125:1:C> The news really is good strangely enough
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#126:1:C> What happened was a whole bunch of people entered the labour force

in October <,> thinking that they were going to get jobs
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#127:1:C> Many of them did but many of them didn't
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#128:1:C> So the unemployment rate goes up because there are more people

looking <,> but not finding
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#129:1:C> <{> <[> In fact </[> the number of employed people went up by

nineteen thousand across the country

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#130:1:A> <[> And that's </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#131:1:A> That's especially significant that that happened in October of all

months uh out of all years
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#132:1:A> <}> <-> Which </-> <=> Of course </=> </}> the referendum was

making everybody uncertain
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#133:1:A> So the fact that people did feel positive enough about jobs being

out there <}> <-> is </-> <=> is </=> </}> rather interesting

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#134:1:C> The big picture is that we had nearly a year of no employment

creation from late nineteen ninety-four until late nineteen ninety-five
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#135:1:C> Now we've had three months in a row of employment creation
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#136:1:C> That's good news

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#137:1:A> Next hour on the phone-in we're going to get even further

away from the referendum
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#138:1:A> We're taking you to a <{> <[> desert island </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#139:1:B> <[> Wow <,> whoa </[> </{>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#140:1:C> <O> laugh </O> Can I come please

<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#145:1:A> Everyone's doing it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#146:1:A> What three books would you take with you <,> to the desert island

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#147:1:C> That's easy
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#148:1:C> Any three books by Patrick O'Brien who's a brilliant British uh

historical novelist <,> whose name does not uh influence my uh my choice
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#149:1:C> Uh and they'd be particularly appropriate for a desert island

because these are sea-faring historical novels uh based on the British navy

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-026#150:1:B> Uhm <}> <-> I </-> <=> I'm </=> </}> a big fan of <quote>

Bonfire of the Vanities </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-026#151:1:B> I love that book
