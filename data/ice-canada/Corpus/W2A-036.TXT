<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-036#4:1> An efficient heuristic algorithm for solving cluster problems

associated with partitioning of power networks is presented in this paper.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#5:1> The algorithm is divided into two stages.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#6:1> The first stage creates an initial partition based on the electrical

distance between system buses.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#7:1> The second stage involves interchanging pairs of buses among the

various clusters of the initial partition.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#8:1> The first stage solves the placement problem of <it> n </it> connected

buses in an <it> r </it> - dimensional Euclidean space; such a problem is

reduced to finding <it> r </it> eigenvectors of a connectivity matrix,

defined as the bus admittance matrix.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#9:1> The second stage is based on a node interchange technique.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#10:1> The node interchange is an iterative heuristic method that can be

used to improve an initial partition.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#11:1> The method moves one bus at a time, from one cluster of the initial

partition to another, in an attempt to maximize the total electrical distance

between clusters of the final partition.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#12:1> Applications of the proposed algorithm to both small and medium-size

power systems are illustrated in this paper. </p> <X>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-036#25:1> Partitioning of large power networks is important because, in

general, only small portions of these networks are affected by a contingency,

such as an outage of a transmission branch, failure of a reactive power

compensator, etc.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#26:1> During such contingencies, there are parts of the network that are

left almost undisturbed.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#27:1> The effi <l> ciency of many application programs in an energy control

centre, such as load flow, optimal power flow and others, can be signifi <l>

cantly improved if only the areas affected by the contingency are considered

for the purpose of correcting the state of operation, as the calculation is

then performed on smaller networks.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#28:1> Smaller networks imply matrices of smaller dimension and,

consequently, a smaller number of computer operations to be performed.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#29:1> The use of smaller control networks can only be accomplished by

partitioning a power network into clusters of buses, such that buses

belonging to the same cluster are strongly connected electrically, while

buses belonging to different clusters are weakly connected electrically. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-036#30:1> To date, all proposed algorithms in power network partitioning

are based on either the minimization of the number edge cut or the total wire

length, and only the physical connections are considered <fnr> [ 5]-[6]

</footnote> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#49:1> The node placement problem is a well-established problem in other

fields of research; for instance, in the design of circuit board layouts in

which a node has to be placed on a two-dimensional board <fnr> [ 4] </fnr>

<footnote> <O> reference [ 4] </O> </footnote> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#50:1> In such problems there are two basic objectives: 1) the minimization

of total wire length connecting the nodes; and, 2) the minimization of the

circuit board area. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-036#51:1> In power systems, however, the geographical placement of a bus

cannot be changed by an electric utility company, since this is defined by

the distribution of population and placement of energy sources.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#52:1> Moreover, the wire length cannot be modified since the transmission

lines only connect the various energy sources to the loads.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#53:1> Nevertheless, it is extremely important to mathematically define a

position on &beta; <sp> <it> r </it> </sp> for each bus of the system.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#54:1> By doing so, according to an electrical criterion, we make the bus

position a part of the data required by this approach to partitioning of the

power network. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-036#55:1> Let us assume that we are given a system with <it> n </it> buses

and an <it> n </it> <O> mathematical symbol </O> <it> n </it> symmetric

connection matrix <bold> C </bold> = <it> C <sb> ij </sb> </it> , where <it>

<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#60:1> Since <it> C </it> is symmetrical ( i.e., <it> C <sb> i </sb> </it> =

<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#63:1> In other words, the <it> i <sp> th </sp> </it> diagonal entry, <it> b

element of <it> b <sb> ij </sb> </it> is the negative of the corresponding

entry in <bold> C </bold> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#64:1> Substituting ( 2.6) into ( 2.4) yields <O> mathematical equation </O> .

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-036#65:1> The Lagrangian of the nonlinear optimization problem described by

( 2.7) and ( 2.2) is defined as <O> Diagram </O> <O> Figure 1 caption </O>

<O> mathematical equation </O> , from which the necessary condition is given

by <O> mathematical equation </O> . <marginalia> ( 2.8) </marginalia> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-036#66:1> Equation ( 2.8) leads to a nontrivial solution of <bold> x

</bold> if and only if <O> mathematical symbol </O> is an eigenvalue of

<bold> B </bold> , and <bold> x </bold> is the corresponding eigenvector.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#67:1> Premultiplying ( 2.8) by <bold> x <sp> T </sp> </bold> and imposing (

2.2), we obtain <O> mathematical equation </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#68:1> Consequently, the value of the objective function described by ( 2.7)

is the value of the eigenvalue of <bold> B </bold> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#69:1> The minimum of ( 2.7) is given by the smallest eigenvalue of <bold> B

</bold> , and the solution, <bold> x </bold> , is the eigen <l> vector

associated with the smallest eigenvalue of <bold> B </bold> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-036#70:1> For the <it> r </it> - dimensional problem, <it> S </it> is

simply the sum of <it> r </it> quadratic terms, one for each dimension, and

the minimum of <it> S </it> is given by the sum of the <it> r </it> smallest

eigenvalues of <bold> B </bold> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#71:1> To illustrate the application of the node placement algorithm [ 9],

consider a four-node graph; its connection matrix, <bold> C </bold> , and the

<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#72:1> It is required that all four nodes be placed in one dimension in a

<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#73:1> The elements of the connectivity matrix <bold> C </bold> are

<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#76:1> Any other combination of node placement ordering gives a larger total

wire length. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-036#77:1> If the same placement procedures are used in power-network

partitioning, only the physical connections of the network will be considered

in a resulting partition; therefore, strongly connected buses may be assigned

to different clusters.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#78:1> A modification in the placement algorithm is required so that the

technique can be suffi <l> ciently utilized in power-network partitioning;

i.e., so that buses belonging to the same cluster are strongly connected

electrically. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-036#79:1> Matrix <bold> B </bold> , as described above, is a weighted

connectivity matrix that measures the distance among buses.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#80:1> By defining each line <O> Diagram </O> <O> Figure 2 caption </O>

connecting two buses of a system as a link, and the electrical distance

between two such buses as the value of the link's transfer impedance, we can

replace matrix <bold> B </bold> by the bus impedance matrix <it> Z </it> <sb>

bus </sb>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#81:1> However, it is computationally impractical to calculate the smallest

eigenvalue of <it> Z </it> <sb> bus </sb> and the corresponding eigenvector

because, in general, <it> Z </it> <sb> bus </sb> is nonsparse.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#82:1> Defining the weighted connectivity matrix <bold> B </bold> as the bus

admittance <it> Y </it> <sb> bus </sb> , which is very sparse, and maximizing

<it> S </it> in ( 2.7) is equivalent to minimizing the transfer impedance

between buses within the same cluster.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#83:1> The maximum of ( 2.7) is given by the largest eigenvalue of <it> Y

</it> <sb> bus </sb> , and the solution is the eigenvector associated with

the largest eigenvalue of <it> Y </it> <sb> bus </sb>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#84:1> In most practical power systems the ratio <it> X/R </it> is large
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#85:1> Consequently, in many cases, it is possible to neglect the

resistances.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#86:1> By doing so, we can represent <it> Y </it> <sb> bus </sb> by its

purely imaginary part, hereafter denoted as <it> B </it> <sb> bus </sb> .

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-036#87:1> The components of the eigenvectors associated with the <it> r

</it> largest eigenvalues of <it> B </it> <sb> bus </sb> represent the

coordinates of the buses on &beta; <sp> <it> r </it> </sp> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#88:1> Now let us define the following transformation: <O> mathematical

equation </O> , <marginalia> ( 2.9) </marginalia> where <it> x </it> <sp> *

</sp> <sb> <it> i </it> </sb> is the largest value of ( - log <sb> 10 </sb> |

<it> x <sb> i </sb> </it> |), for all <it> i </it> = 1, 2, &dotted-line;,

<it> n </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#89:1> Applying ( 2.9) to each component of each eigenvector associated with

the largest <it> r </it> eigenvalues transfers the coordinates of the buses

such that distances are measured with respect to the order of magni <l> tude.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#90:1> Moreover, the negative sign always keeps the data for these buses in

a positive coordinate.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#91:1> A power-network initial partition into <it> r </it> clusters is

obtained by applying the <it> leader </it> algorithm [ 10] to the transformed

coordinates of the buses. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-036#92:1> The <it> leader </it> algorithm constructs a number of clusters

of buses, a leading bus ( centroid), and a distance <it> TH </it> for each

cluster, such that every bus in a cluster is within a distance <it> TH </it>

from the leading bus.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#93:1> The algorithm makes one pass through the transformed

buses-coordinates, assigning each bus to the first cluster whose leader is

close enough, and making a new cluster and a new leader for buses that are

not close to any existing leaders.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#94:1> The distance between bus <it> i </it> and the leader of any cluster

is defined as <O> mathematical equation </O> , where <it> x </it> , <it> y

</it> and &gamma; are the leader coordinates. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-036#95:1> The distance <it> TH </it> is selected such that it creates no

more than the required number of clusters
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#96:1> As an example, suppose a three-dimensional placement of seven buses

whose transformed coordi <l> nates are as follows: <O> mathematical equation

</O>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#97:1> It is required that the previous seven-bus system be partitioned into

three clusters.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#98:1> Starting at bus 1 as the centroid of cluster 1, if <it> TH </it> = 2,

then three clusters are created.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#99:1> If <it> TH </it> = 4, only two clusters are created
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#100:1> By adjusting <it> TH </it> to 3, we ensure that three clusters are

created, such that buses 1, 3 and 5 are placed in the first cluster, buses 2

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-036#102:1> A popular class of algorithms for partitioning the nodes of a

graph begins with a random partition and tries to improve it by interchang

<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#103:1> These types of algorithms are called node interchange algorithms.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-036#104:1> The main idea of the node interchange algorithm is as follows:
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#105:1> Given a partition ( <it> A </it> , <it> B </it> ) of a power

network, the algorithm moves one bus at a time from one cluster of the

partition to another cluster in an attempt to minimize the electrical

distance and the number of link cuts between pairs of clusters in the final

partition.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#106:1> The bus to be moved ( call it the base bus) is chosen on the basis

of both the balance criterion ( the cluster size) and the effect on the

weight associated with the number of link cuts.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#107:1> Let us define the gain, <it> g </it> ( <it> i </it> ) , of bus <it>

i </it> as the value by which the weight associated with the link cuts would

decrease, were bus <it> i </it> moved from its current cluster to the

complementary cluster. </I> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#X108:1> During each move, we must keep in mind the balance criterion to

prevent all buses from migrating to one cluster of the partition, for that

would surely be the best partition, were balance to be ignored.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#X109:1> Thus the balance criterion is used to select the cluster from which

a bus of highest gain is to be moved.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-036#X110:1> After all moves have been made, the best partition encountered

during the pass is taken as the output of the pass. </p> </X>
