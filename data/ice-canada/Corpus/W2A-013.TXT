<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#1:1> <h> Preface </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-013#2:1> This book is about the political belief systems of new elites, the

youth elites of the 1980s, in the Anglo-American democracies - the old

states.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#3:1> The similarities and differences among and between the political

cultures of Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States

have been probed, debated, re-examined, and debated again for more than half

a century.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#4:1> In the 1960s, newly developed cross-national survey techniques

produced evidence that added fuel to those speculations.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#5:1> Remarkably, however, no cross-national attitudinal research comparing

all five coun <l> tries followed the path-breaking studies of the 1960s.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#6:1> This study aims to go some distance towards filling that gap, and the

argument it proposes is a simple one.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#7:1> Enormous changes swept across all advanced industrial states during

the last two decades.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#8:1> The Anglo-American democracies, like other countries, experienced the

globalization of their economies, the information revolution, profound

structural transformations, and dra <l> matic shifts in population

replacement.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#9:1> Long-standing patterns of politi <l> cal behaviour eroded, traditional

alliances unravelled, and new issues forced their way onto political agendas.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#10:1> The ideological climate of the 1980s, we suggest, bore little

resemblance to the ideological climate of the 1960s and, for a variety of

reasons, those shifts in ideology were disproportionately concentrated in the

ranks of the new generations.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#11:1> In what respects, then, are the political belief systems of new

elites in the Anglo-American democracies similar?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#12:1> In what respects are they dif <l> ferent?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#13:1> These are the questions we ask, and we answer them with com <l>

parative cross-national survey evidence from all five countries. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-013#14:1> This book is written with a broad audience in mind.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#15:1> Our aim is to make the results of the study accessible to those

without formal training in quantitative methods and to those who are being

introduced to, or who have a general interest in, the contemporary politics

of the Anglo-American democracies.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#16:1> Where possible, we present our findings by way of graphic

illustrations.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#17:1> Where we resort to summary statistical presenta <l> tion of evidence,

we rely on relatively few simple measures, which are explained in the text.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#18:1> Our hope is that this study will contribute to a revitalized debate

about politics both in and between each of the five countries as well as

about the transformation of advanced industrial states in general. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-013#19:1> This project was truly a collaborative effort.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#20:1> We drew heavily upon the goodwill of many colleagues and institutions

in all of the five countries represented in the study.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#21:1> We are happy to be able to acknowledge publicly our gratitude for

their help. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-013#22:1> The study was ten years in the making.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#23:1> In the late 1970s, while orches <l> trating the Cross Naional Survey

Project, Sidney Verba co-ordinated a number of brainstorming sessions at the

Center for International Affairs, Harvard University, dealing with the

opportunities, difficulties, and prac <l> ticalities of cross-national survey

research.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#24:1> It was during those stimulating meetings that the prospect of

undertaking a comparative Anglo-American study was first discussed.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#25:1> This project would never have been started, undertaken, or completed

without the intellectual leadership and moral support of Sidney Verba.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#26:1> We thank him for allowing us to use the Ameri <l> can data for this

project.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#27:1> More importantly, we are very grateful for his continual

encouragement. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-013#28:1> Several other institutions and individuals were also crucial to

the project.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#29:1> The Australian field work was conducted from the Australian National

University at both Canberra and Darwin.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#30:1> The University of Essex gave us work space from which we co-ordinated

the British segment of the study.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#31:1> Tony King, Ian Budge, and Ivor Crewe were very gracious hosts.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#32:1> Nigel Roberts and Rod Alley made the New Zealand component of the

study possible.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#33:1> And in Canada we were willingly aided in a variety of ways by

colleagues across the country.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#34:1> We particularly appreciate the contributions of Herman Bakvis,

Andr&eacute; Blais, Marsha Chandler, Jean Cr&ecircumflex;te, Barry Kay,

Richard Johnston, and Richard Simeon.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#35:1> Some of the analysis was undertaken at the Center for Political

Studies, University of Michigan.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#36:1> Sam Barnes and Ronald Inglehart made that workspace a home. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-013#37:1> The project placed a unique burden on our own institution, the

Univer <l> sity of Calgary. For steering us through a maze of computing

related matters we are grateful to Thomas Huang and Ted Ziajka.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#38:1> We were very lucky to have extremely able research assistants: Robert

Burge got the project underway and Lori Galbraith held it together, carrying

the bulk of the computational and graphics work through to its conclusion.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#39:1> We are very appreciative of their efforts and abilities.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#40:1> We also thank our colleagues in the department of political science

for their congenial support. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-013#41:1> The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada

provided the financial wherewithal for the project ( <smallcaps> SSHRC

</smallcaps> grant
#410-88-0221).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#42:1> We thank them not only for underwriting the hard costs but also for

providing sabbatical leave fellowships that enabled us to conduct the field

work and to start attacking the analysis.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#43:1> Several individu <l> als provided us with constructive criticism of

the early drafts of various parts of the book.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#44:1> Seymour Martin Lipset, Paul Sniderman, and Sylvia Bashevkin were

particularly helpful.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#45:1> Robert Boardman, Jon Pammett, and Campbell Sharman read the entire

manuscript and provided both thoughtful commentary and a number of helpful

suggestions.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#46:1> We are very grateful to them, and to Richard Teleky, managing editor

of Oxford University Press, who coaxed us along with the manuscript. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-013#47:1> Both of us borrowed time from our families.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#48:1> We extend a special thanks to Susan Bloch-Nevitte and Isabel Gibbins,

who were understanding when we fell short on what we imagine to be the normal

responsibilities of spouses in normal families.

<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#53:1> <h> Ideological Change in the Anglo-American Democracies </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#54:1> <h> Introduction </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-013#55:1> This study examines the nature of political belief systems <fnr>

<sp> 1 </sp> </fnr> in the five Anglo-American democracies - Australia,

Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#56:1> Perhaps no other five countries in the industrialized world are more

alike; they share not only roughly compara <l> ble economies, social

structures, and cultural environments, but also the same political tradition.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#57:1> Compared with other industrially advanced states, each of the

Anglo-American democracies has a long history of open, stable, and liberal

democratic style of government.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#58:1> For the most part, citizens of the Anglo-American democracies view

their systems of government as legitimate, and the transfer of power has

rarely taken place in an atmosphere of crisis; it has been routine.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#59:1> Throughout this century political contests have not been battles

about the rules of the game; instead, the battles have been about ideas,

policies, leaders, and parties. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-013#60:1> It is not surprising, then, that comparative social scientists

often regard the Anglo-American democracies as a special subset of advanced

indus <l> trial states, a distinct analytic category.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#61:1> This practice gained considerable momentum in the 1950s and early

1960s with the publication of such landmark works as Louis Hartz's <it>

Founding of New Societies </it> , Alexander Brady's <it> Democracy in the

Dominions </it> , Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba's <it> Civic Culture </it>

, and Robert Alford's <it> Party and Society </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#62:1> These studies, along with a number of influential articles by Seymour

Martin Lipset, Gabriel Almond, and others, all underscored the same point:

Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States were all

<quote> 'different examples of the same type' </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#63:1> Some scholars emphasized the remarkably similar <quote> 'climate'

</quote> or <quote> 'spirit' </quote> of politics in the five states.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#64:1> Others identified secular <l> ism and homogeneity as the unifying

themes, while yet others pointed up similarities in styles of political

combat and political values - pluralism, pragmatism, individualism, and the

non-ideological sense of compromise.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#65:1> The language differed but the message was the same - all five

countries shared a common political culture beyond what one might expect from

their similar status as Western industrialized states. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-013#66:1> By the middle of the 1960s, however, the conceptual tide turned.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#67:1> Armies of scholars drawing upon a variety of analytical traditions,

and working from national rather than cross-national perspectives, challenged

the notion that the Anglo-American democracies were <quote> 'essentially the

same' </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#68:1> The historical vineyards were re-worked to show that <quote> 'significant

differ <l> ences' </quote> existed, and could be traced to variations in

founding traditions.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#69:1> Variations in political institutions, social structures, and literary

traditions were probed to bolster the case for the essential differences

between national political cultures.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#70:1> Canadian scholars, for example, reacting per <l> haps to concerns

about the <quote> 'Americanization' </quote> of Canadian culture, entered the

fray contending that the differences between Canadian and American values

were not <quote> 'mere nuances' </quote> , but fundamental.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#71:1> American analysts, meanwhile, busily mounted a powerful and

incidentally comple <l> mentary case for American exceptionalism.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#72:1> Throughout the Anglo-Amer <l> ican democracies, the effort and

conclusions focused on contrasts, not similarities. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-013#73:1> Today the friction between these two visions persists, and in the

final analysis it hinges on one central empirical question: Are there

significant differences between and among the contemporary political cultures

of the five Anglo-American democracies?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#74:1> Certainly there are countless national arguments to support, for

example, the expectation that the political culture of Australia will differ

significantly from that of Britain, and that of Britain from the political

culture of the United States.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#75:1> For readers and scholars in those countries whose main concern is to

explain national political cultures to domestic populations, idiosyncratic

features are often to be treasured and vigorously defended.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#76:1> At the same time, however, we have compelling reasons to expect

cultural similarity.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#77:1> The Anglo-American democracies not only share the structural

characteristics com <l> mon to all industrial states; they also share a

common political tradition.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#78:1> Thus the expectation of similarity is driven not only by more general

patterns of structural and ideological convergence within the Western world,

but also by history.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#79:1> At root, however, remains the basic empirical question: Are there

significant national differences in political culture?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#80:1> Until and unless such differences can be demonstrated, it is

premature to speculate on the reasons why national differences might persist

in an era of global ideological convergence. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#81:1> <h> <it> Methodological Overview </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-013#82:1> Our entry into this debate about cross-national similarities and

differ <l> ences in political values is shaped by three themes that regularly

emerge in these disputes.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#83:1> First, we accept, of course, that competing interpreta <l> tions of

the same phenomena are a normal part of academic debate in all disciplines,

as are attempts to resolve discrepancies of interpretation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#84:1> In this instance, for example, it might be argued that the

differences between the two visions of the Anglo-American democracies can be

squared away simply by acknowleging that each operates at a diferent level of

generalization.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#85:1> After all, what appears close up to be an <quote> 'important

difference' </quote> easily fades into insignificance when global comparisons

are entertained.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#86:1> Australians and Canadians might be expected to be alert and sensitive

to differences between the two countries, whereas an observer from Africa

could be excused for emphasizing their similarities ( climatic differences

notwithstanding!).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#87:1> But that line of reasoning is not entirely convincing either, because

it obscures the fact that much of the debate centres around the same unit of

observation - national values - and that the empirical question still remains

as to whether or not signifi <l> cant differences exist. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-013#88:1> Second, most comparative judgements about values in the five

Anglo-American democracies rely almost entirely upon indirect evidence.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#89:1> National differences in crime rates, for example, might be used to

specu <l> late on the importance of citizen deference to political elites in

the civic cultures of the countries under examination.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#90:1> However, forming conclu <l> sions about contemporary public attitudes

on the basis of inherited politi <l> cal institutions and social patterns is

risky and contentious.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#91:1> It is equally hazardous to rely on a theory about founding traditions

to make infer <l> ences about the national values of populations several

generations removed from founding circumstances.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#92:1> The problem is that to get from institutional, social structural,

literary, and historical evidence to conclu <l> sions about national values

in the 1980s and beyond requires a logical leap of faith.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#93:1> Many of the existing studies that rely on these impressionistic

sources are both imaginative and persuasive, but they do not escape the

limitations of having to rely on inference.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#94:1> This debate about comparative similarities and differences has raged

now for more than twenty-five years, during which time comparative social

scientists have continued to use the Anglo-American democracies as a major

analytic category.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-013#95:1> From that standpoint, it is remarkable that no single study has ever

provided direct comparative evidence of national values in all five

countries. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-013#96:1> Third, and relatedly, if claims to the effect that the

Anglo-American democracies share <quote> 'essentially the same political

values' </quote> ring hollow in the absence of direct evidence of those

similarities, then so do counterclaims about national uniqueness. </p> </I>
