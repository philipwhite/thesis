<I>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#1:1> <unclear> a few words </unclear> they're draining on energy <O> laugh

</O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#2:1> <}> <-> I ah </-> <=> <}> <-> what </-> <=> what </=> </}> you'll </=>

</}> notice is you'll work an eight-hour workday and come home exhausted at

five o'clock where an entrepreneur will go for fourteen sixteen hours and at

the end of the day well all pumped up and all ready to go for some more
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#3:1> Uh it's all a function of doing something you love as opposed to doing

something just for a paycheck <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#4:1> <O> cough </O> <,> And <,> if you're looking for security from the

large corporations <,> uh only sixteen of the <unclear> word </unclear>

hundred largest corporations at the start of the twentieth century still

exist today
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#5:1> Ah during the eighties a total of two hundred and thirty companies <,>

disappeared from the Fortune Five Hundred
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#6:1> Only twenty-nine of the top a hundred companies <,> are still in the

top a hundred today
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#7:1> So in other words large corporations are no longer the security that

they used to be in the past
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#8:1> <?> As a </?> matter of fact many of them are either breaking up or

merging or <,,> you know uh uh outsourcing virtual <unclear> word </unclear>

their work and so they're becoming virtual corporations
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#9:1> Uhm <,,> what I would like to do <,> if I can <,,> no
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#10:1> This just just shows you the <,> change from <}> <-> the </-> <=> uh

<,> you know the </=> </}> <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#11:1> Eighty-five percent of <,> the workers in the early nineteen nineties

were in <}> <-> <.> ag </.> </-> <=> agriculture </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#12:1> Now agriculture involves less than three percent of the workforce
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#13:1> <unclear> word </unclear> a lot of opportunities in agriculture
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#14:1> A student of mine uh <}> <-> had a uh uh </-> <=> his father was a

farmer </=> </}> and farmers are really <,> being hard hit <,> traditional

farmers wheat corn <}> <-> all the </-> <=> all the </=> </}> traditional

crops
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#15:1> So this <,> guy's <?> really </?> sharp and he decided he'd go into a

growing niche market
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#16:1> He <}> <-> <.> crea </.> </-> <=> started <}> <-> growing </-> <=>

learning to grow </=> </}> </=> </}> Chinese vegetables <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#17:1> A very small market but if you become the big fish in that small

market <,> uh <unclear> a few words mumbled </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#18:1> <}> <-> He had he had </-> <=> He had </=> </}> his business and was

so successful that actually Agriculture Canada called him
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#19:1> He was twenty-two years old at the time
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#20:1> They wanted him to come to Ottawa to talk to all the farmers from out

west and <}> <-> explain to him </-> <=> explain to them </=> </}> how he was

successful
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#21:1> So I said well why are you going to go and tell them all your secrets
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#22:1> He said I'm not telling them all the secrets
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#23:1> He says <unclear> a few words mumbled </unclear> the trip's on them
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#24:1> They're going to pay my uh <?> bedroom </?> <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#25:1> He admitted of course he uh said he would have gone to Dallas looked

over some land and found some land to buy because <,> Dallas being close to

Mexico being close to the labour for the <?> farm <,> <}> <-> the <.> ill

</.> </?> </-> <=> the illegal </=> </}> immigrants who come in and <}> <->

do </-> <=> do </=> </}> the farming
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#26:1> And <}> <-> he said </-> <=> he said </=> </}> to me he says uh I

don't know what I should do
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#27:1> He said should I stay in <,> school finish my degree or should I go

and start <,> my Chinese vegetables in Dallas <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#28:1> So I said well <,> seeing as you don't need a degree <}> <-> to to

</-> <=> to </=> </}> be successful in Dallas I <?> said </?> I'd go to

Dallas and <unclear> a few words mumbled </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#29:1> Last I heard he was quite successful
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#30:1> Uhm so in the fifties the nineteen fifties seventy-three percent of

employees worked in manufacturing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#31:1> Now less than fifteen percent do
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#32:1> Manufacturing has gone the way of the dinosaur
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#33:1> And now you're looking at service industries typically information

<,,> service industries <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#34:1> <?> The reason </?> <unclear> word </unclear> jobs change is

<unclear> word </unclear> happen faster than it ever did in the past
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#35:1> Uh change is around us
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#36:1> It's constant
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#37:1> And you have to learn now to adapt to constant change
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#38:1> Get comfortable with this shifting platform and never really being

secure solid stable for any period of time
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#39:1> Things and conditions are changing constantly
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#40:1> Uhm <quote> the certainty of misery is better than the misery of

uncertainty </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#41:1> That's uh from a Pogo cartoon and it shows why a lot of people are

resistant to change and deny change because they are comfortable in what

they've done so long that they don't <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}>

change because it's certainty
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#42:1> And <?> certainty is comforting </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#43:1> <}> <-> I was a </-> <=> I was a </=> </}> cop for six years by the

way in Westmount
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#44:1> <}> <-> One of my this is my fifth </-> <=> <,> I'm going into my

fifth career </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#45:1> Uh I was a cop back in the sixties in Westmont for six years and we

noticed this phenomenon with abused women
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#46:1> Often we'd go and we'd ask them to get out of the relationship
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#47:1> Like we'd get the same call over and over back to the same home to

the same abusive relationship we'd say come lay charges get rid of him <,>

and you know what again <quote> <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> certainty

of misery is better than the misery of uncertainty </quote> and they wouldn't

break away from that relation because they got <,> trapped into this <,> uh

habit or if you will comfort zone of certainty <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#48:1> Anyway uh <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> bottom line is in order

to be an entrepreneur you have to be comfortable with a roller coaster of

uncertainty
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#49:1> And uh roller coasters <}> <-> are </-> <=> for some </=> </}> people

are exciting and for other people they're <,> scary
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#50:1> Some people hate the roller coaster
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#51:1> Other people love the roller coaster
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#52:1> You have to learn to love the roller coaster <O> laugh </O> because

<}> <-> in in </-> <=> in </=> </}> your own business you're not going to get

that certainty of the regular paycheck the nine to five <?> that </?> you

know exactly what's going tomorrow
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#53:1> Tomorrow is undetermined <,,> and that's the excitement of it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#54:1> That's the fun of it is nothing happens tomorrow until you make it

happen
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#55:1> It's a little scary <O> laugh </O> and it puts a lot on your

shoulders but it's going to be fun
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#56:1> And the thing is it's just a question of <?> labelling </?> it as

exciting and fun as opposed to being fearful
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#57:1> Uhm <,> so let's look at who our entrepreneur like <}> <-> what what

</-> <=> ha what </=> </}> makes them tick
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#58:1> I'll show you some uh information here on uh <,> business majors

versus entrepreneurship majors versus non-business majors
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#59:1> In terms of conformity <,,> you can see that entrepreneurship majors

have a <,> very low level of conformity than do business majors and

non-business majors
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#60:1> In other words <,> they <}> <-> don't </-> <=> <,,> aren't </=> </}>

uh <,> hurt by social sabotage
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#61:1> Social sabotage is the concept that if you have a good idea for a

business first thing you do is go tell <,> your <,> spouse your <,> relatives

your friends they'll say wow is ever that a good idea
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#62:1> You're all pumped up
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#63:1> You're ready to go <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#64:1> So what's the first reaction <,,> <&> Audience responds </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#65:1> You're nuts
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#66:1> Don't be crazy
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#67:1> Go and get a real job
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#68:1> Right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#69:1> So now <}> <-> if you </-> <=> if you </=> </}> allow that to take

the wind out of your sails <,> then you're stuck in that trap of conformity
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#70:1> In other words you're not doing what's normal or expected so

therefore <,> <}> <-> you <.> sh </.> </-> <=> you don't </=> </}> fit in
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#71:1> You have to be able to break that bond
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#72:1> You have to be able to <,> go even though everybody says no it

doesn't make sense
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#73:1> So that's where entrepreneurship majors uh have that <}> <-> less

</-> or <=> more </=> </}> innovative more creative
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#74:1> More off the wall <,> perhaps
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#75:1> Energy level much higher <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#76:1> You know I find that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#77:1> You know the harsh reality <}> <-> isn't </-> <=> isn't </=> </}> set

here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#78:1> That is to say I see it the other way around <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#79:1> In other words I don't see high energy people going in business for

themselves
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#80:1> I see that going in business for yourself picking up your energy <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#81:1> Uh the reverse <?> causality </?> if you will
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#82:1> In other words <}> <-> if you have </-> <=> if you go </=> </}> to a

regular job nine to five every day <}> <-> it's </-> <=> it's </=> </}>

draining
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#83:1> It's tiring
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#84:1> You're exhausted
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#85:1> You don't know why you're <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#86:1> In fact the less you do in the job the more tiring it is
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#87:1> If that makes any sense whatsoever
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#88:1> And it's even going to work and coming home
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#89:1> Uh I see them on the commuter trains
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#90:1> I see them <}> <-> on the <.> ar </.> </-> <=> on the buses </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#91:1> You ever see the people
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#92:1> They're a herd going in in the morning and coming home at night
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#93:1> Are they smiling
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#94:1> <?> Let me ask you </?> <,> do they look like they're going off to

have a good time
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#95:1> No way <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#96:1> They're exhausted
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#97:1> <}> <-> They're <.> b </.> </-> <=> they're beat </=> </}> before <?>

they've got to work </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#98:1> So <}> <-> the the </-> <=> the </=> </}> energy level is not there
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#99:1> And at work if your boss says would you mind doing this oh boy huh

not another thing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#100:1> You watch an entrepreneur in action and you'll see these people

fifteen sixteen hours a day
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#101:1> I've had entrepreneurs into my class
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#102:1> Now these guys have been up since seven in the morning <,> <?>

having </?> had a full day come into my class eight twenty-five to <,> ten

thirty or ten fifty at night <,> and they're on top of their game
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#103:1> And the students say excuse me <,> how many hours a day <,> do you

work
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#104:1> And do you know what they answer
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#105:1> They look funny and they go <,> I don't know cos it's not work
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#106:1> Ah eh eh it's Confucious that said <quote> if you get a job that you

like you'll never have to work another day in your life </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#107:1> Well that's what it's all about for entrepreneurs
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#108:1> They don't count hours
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#109:1> There is no such thing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#110:1> There is no on and off
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#111:1> There is no talk about beep time to go home <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#112:1> It's hey <}> <-> there is it it </-> <=> <}> <-> their </-> <=>

their </=> </}> </=> </}> work runs into their life
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#113:1> And so they <unclear> word </unclear> working sixteen hours no

problem
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#114:1> Uh interpersonal effect <,> much lower
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#115:1> Interpersonal effect means the impact that people have on you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#116:1> In other words how much you are influenced by others
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#117:1> And actually if you're highly influenced by others you're not going

to <?> go </?> into business for yourself because it won't take long for

someone to decide that would be crazy <unclear> word </unclear> go with the

other way instead
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#118:1> Risk taking higher
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#119:1> Social adroitness higher <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#120:1> Social adroitness is a skill of entrepreneurs called networking <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#121:1> The name of the game is the more people you know the more business

you do
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#122:1> So entrepreneurs real entrepreneurs <}> <-> and the <unclear> word

</unclear> </-> <=> and the people </=> </}> who are <unclear> word

</unclear> they would have known half of you by now because before they would

have been hanging in <unclear> word </unclear> saying hi nice to meet you <,>

exchanging cards finding out who's who <,> seeing if they can make a deal

seeing if they kind find at least one or two people here who they will be

able to contact next week to be able to do some business with <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#123:1> That's networking <,> and that's what entrepreneurs do extremely

well <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#124:1> Uhm autonomy very high
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#125:1> They're very individualistic <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#126:1> Change <,> very high
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#127:1> They don't mind the concept of change
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#128:1> In fact they relish it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#129:1> They love it <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#130:1> And harm avoidance low
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#131:1> In other words <}> <-> they're not </-> <=> they're not </=> </}>

motivated to avoid harm
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#132:1> They <unclear> a few words </unclear> with risk taking
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#133:1> And <unclear> word </unclear> is low
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#134:1> <unclear> word </unclear> is uh uhm uh non-profit <?> maybe </?> too

nice
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#135:1> <}> <-> They don't they they </-> <=> it's </=> </}> finding guts

<O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#136:1> Entrepreneurship is fun
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#137:1> It has to be fun
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#138:1> If you're going into business to do some
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#139:1> I could give you a hundred great business ideas <,,> and so tomorrow

you could go out and start one of them and probably be successful
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#140:1> I'll show you when I show you ideas
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#141:1> I'll show you some great ideas <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#142:1> But if you don't like it if you're not going to enjoy it <,> then

why do it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#143:1> If you're going to do it sixteen hours seven hours a week why do it

unless it's fun <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#144:1> So there has to be a fun element
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#145:1> You have to be doing something you like <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#146:1> And of course the second half of that equation is profit <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#147:1> If it's fun without profit it's a hobby <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#148:1> So if you don't have that profit motivation you won't be a good

entrepreneur
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#149:1> And <}> <-> that's </-> <=> that's </=> </}> what holds a lot of

people back <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#150:1> You know <}> <-> you are </-> <=> <O> laugh </O> as a consumer </=>

</}> if you ever
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#151:1> When you're wearing your hat and your role is consumer when you go

into a store uh <}> <-> you </-> <=> you're </=> </}> taught to be a good

consumer
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#152:1> You're taught to be like a vulture
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#153:1> You know <,> wait and see and if a store looks like it's going out

of business wait till next week cos maybe they'll be fifty percent off
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#154:1> You know you're driving a hard bargain <}> <-> as a <}> <-> <.> con

</.> </-> <+> consumer </+> </}> </-> <=> as a customer </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-036#155:1> And so on the other side if you're the entrepreneur <}> <-> or or

</-> <=> or </=> </}> the sales person <,> then you have to also play

hardball too because otherwise you'll be ending up giving everything away
