<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#8:1> Microstructural and petrofabric analyses of mylonites from the

Monashee D&eacute;collement demonstrate that the hanging wall was displaced

eastward over the footwall.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#9:1> Microstructural kinematic indicators include shear-band foliation,

asymmetric strain shadows, and S - C fabrics.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#10:1> Quartz <it> c </it> axes locally exhibit asymmetric fabrics that are

consistent with the microstructural evidence for sense of shear.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#11:1> The kinematic evidence is reliable because multiple criteria coexist

within individual specimens. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#12:1> Metamorphic assemblages from footwall Monashee Complex pelites at

the Revelstoke damsite indicate that the peak meta <l> morphic assemblage was

sillimanite - K-feldspar - biotite - almandine - quartz <w> + <sb> - </sb>

</w> plagioclase.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#13:1> Biotite - garnet geothermom <l> etry and garnet - plagioclase -

sillimanite - quartz geobarometry set broad constraints on metamorphic

temperatures but closer constraints on pressures, near 650&degree;C and 630

MPa. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#14:1> Comparison of these data with Late Cretaceous hornblende cooling

ages from the same locality indicates that the metamor <l> phism is at least

as old as Late Cretaceous.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#15:1> Complex microstructures relating to repeated mylonitization and

annealing render difficult the correlation of metamorphic conditions with

mylonitic fabrics.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#16:1> Early mylonitic textures predate the metamorphic equilibration and

thus are pre-Late Cretaceous in age.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#17:1> Postmetamorphic mylonites are well preserved, but their ages are

poorly constrained.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#18:1> The present interpretation favours a Late Cretaceous to Paleocene age

relating to compressional tectonics.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#19:1> However, an Early Eocene age relating to extensional shearing cannot

be excluded. </p> <O> French Abstract </O>

<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#21:1> <h> <bold> Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#22:1> The Monashee d&eacute;collement has been interpreted as a zone of

shearing that accommodated large-scale crustal shortening during Mesozoic

orogenesis ( e.g., Read and Brown 1981; Okulitch 1984; Brown <it> et al </it> .

1986; Brown and Journeay 1987).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#23:1> The d&eacute;collement was subsequently reactivated by early Tertiary

brittle normal faulting ( Lane 1984a) related to regional extension, uplift,

and quenching of isotopic systems ( e.g., Mathews 1981, 1983; Parrish <it> et

al </it> . 1985; Bardoux1985; Carr <it> et al </it> . 1987).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#24:1> As an example of a Cordilleran meta <l> morphic core complex (

Crittenden <it> et al </it> . 1980; Brown and Read 1983), the Monashee

Complex has been the subject of ongoing debate on the relative importance of

Mesozoic shortening versus Tertiary extension in the geologic evolution of

the region. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#25:1> One model concluded that Late Jurassic to Cretaceous west <l>

ward underthrusting of the deforming Cordilleran orogen by the North American

craton created a crustal-scale duplex that uplifted and cooled the Monashee

Complex ( Brown <it> et al </it> . 1986).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#26:1> The Monashee D&eacute;collement was interpreted as the roof thrust of

the duplex, forming primarily as a result of regional shortening of Jurassic

to Cretaceous age.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#27:1> Regional uplift and cooling occurred primarily in the Mesozoic

because of crustal duplexing, with later reactivation by modest early

Tertiary extension and uplift. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#28:1> An alternative model was based on data from the Valhalla and

Okanagan complexes in southern British Columbia ( Par <l> rish and Carr 1986;

Carr <it> et al </it> . 1987).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#29:1> It differed in that the role of well-documented Eocene extension was

emphasized as the mechanism of uplift and cooling of the metamorphic complex.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#30:1> Tertiary extensional faulting of 10 - 15 km magnitude on the

margins of the Monashee Complex near latitude 51 &degree;N has been

interpreted previously ( Read and Brown 1981; Lane 1984a; Brown and Journeay

1987).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#31:1> Recent models of major Tertiary extension across the Okanagan Complex

in southern British Columbia suggest extension by as much as 60 - 100 km,

accommodated by ductile shearing at depth and brittle faulting at higher

structural levels ( Tempelman-Kluit and Parkinson 1986; Parrish and Carr

1986; but see Okulitch 1987).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#32:1> These models either imply that a similar magnitude of extension

occurred on the Monashee D&eacute;collement and Colum <l> bia River fault

zone or require a rapid decrease in extension magnitude northward along

strike. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#33:1> The recognition of important Tertiary extension in southern

British Columbia results in part from precise dating of syn <l> kinematic

magmatism, which is widespread in the Okanagan and Valhalla complexes.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#34:1> The magmatism is spatially, and perhaps genetically, related to major

extension ( e.g., Mathews 1981; Carr <it> et al </it> . 1987).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#35:1> Conversely, the timing of displace <l> ments along the Monashee

D&eacute;collement is relatively poorly constrained, correlative with a lack

of important synkinematic plutonism.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#36:1> A different approach is therefore required to answer the questions of

when and under what conditions Mesozoic shortening was replaced by Tertiary

extension. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#37:1> This paper begins to address those questions by document <l> ing

the microstructures, metamorphic-mineral assemblages, and pressure -

temperature ( <it> P - T </it> ) conditions as preserved in metasediments at

the Revelstoke damsite.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#38:1> During construction of the dam across the Columbia River valley, the

effects of ductile shearing and brittle faulting on the Monashee

D&eacute;colle <l> ment and Columbia River fault zone were temporarily well

exposed.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#39:1> We elaborate on earlier microstructural evidence for top-to-the-east

sense of shear on the d&eacute;collement north of Revelstoke ( see Brown and

Murphy 1982) by documenting multiple kinematic criteria that are consistent

over 50 km of strike length.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#40:1> The microstructural and metamorphic data are then compared with the

local cooling history.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#41:1> From these data we evaluate the extent to which the relative

importance of Mesozoic compression and Tertiary extension can be con <l>

strained. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#42:1> <h> <bold> Structural setting </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#43:1> Development of the orogen began in the Jurassic with the collapse

of a marginal basin and obduction of a magmatic arc.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#44:1> Middle Jurassic west-verging deformation shortened and thickened the

continental-margin sedimentary prism, resulting in regional metamorphism.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#45:1> That was followed by westward underthrusting of the thickened

metasedimentary pile by the North American cratonic basement and the

formation of a crustal-scale duplex in Late Jurassic through Cretaceous time.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#46:1> Early Tertiary extension later modified the compressional orogen (

see Brown <it> et al. </it> ( 1986) for a comprehensive treatment). </p> <O>

map </O> <O> map caption </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#47:1> The Monashee Complex ( Fig. 1) is exposed as a tectonic window

through the overlying Selkirk Allochthon ( Read and Brown 1981; Brown and

Journeay 1987).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#48:1> Structural geometry in the hanging wall is complex as a result of

polyphase defor <l> mation ( e.g., Brown and Tippett 1978; Raeside and Simony

1983; Brown and Lane 1988).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#49:1> The structural geometry in the footwall Monashee Complex is also

complex ( Read and Klepacki 1981; H&ouml;y and Brown 1980; Journeay 1986),

but neither structures nor metamorphism can be directly cor <l> related

across the Monashee D&eacute;collement to the Selkirk Allochthon ( Wheeler

1965; Okulitch 1984; Journeay 1986). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#50:1> On the west side of the complex, where the d&eacute;collement

dips shallowly westward, two periods of ductile thrusting ( west over east)

were interpreted as Late Jurassic and Late Creta <l> ceous to Paleocene in

age ( Journeay 1986). <O> map </O> <O> map caption </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#51:1> Ductile and brittle west-side-down normal faulting of presumed Eocene

age reactivated the earlier mylonite zones in an extensional mode ( Brown and

Journeay 1987).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#52:1> The transition from contraction to extension is marked on the west

margin of the complex by a vergence reversal in the shear zones ( Brown and

Journeay 1987). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#53:1> Because west and east margins are contiguous around the north end

of the complex ( Fig. 1), there must have been a con <l> tractional history

on the east margin.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#54:1> However, the contrac <l> tional and extensional parts of the history

have never been distinguished because the kinematics are the same for both.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#55:1> Although brittle extensional faulting on the Columbia River Fault is

unequivocally early Tertiary in age ( Lane 1984 <it> b </it> ) , the question

of how much, if any, of the ductile fabric relates to Tertiary shearing (

contractional or extensional) has not yet been addressed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#58:1> Detailed studies at several localities along the mylonite zone

indicate a consistent, broadly east-west mylonitic extension lineation and

shallow eastward- or northward-dipping mylo <l> nitic foliation ( Fig. 2) <O>

plot </O> <O> plot caption </O> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#59:1> Foliations axial planar to Middle Jurassic southwest-verging folds in

the hanging wall ( S <sb> 2 </sb> ) and variably oriented lineations ( L <sb>

2 </sb> ) parallel to hinge lines are progressively reoriented toward the

mylonitic fabrics ( S <sb> m </sb> , L <sb> m </sb> ) in the

d&eacute;collement ( Fig. 2).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#60:1> Variability of the mylonitic foliation reflects syn-mylonite folding

( Fig. 3).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#61:1> Hinges of tight to isoclinal syn-mylonite ductile minor folds at the

Revelstoke damsite form two clusters adjacent to the southeast-trending

mylonitic extension lineation when plotted on an equal-area stereographic

projection ( Fig. 3 <it> a </it> ) .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#62:1> Hinges trending easterly have Z shapes viewed down-plunge and those

trending southerly have S shapes, indicating a local southeastward dis <l>

placement of the hanging wall. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#63:1> Later folds, which probably represent a late increment of the

ductile shearing, locally rotated the mylonitic foliation and lineation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#64:1> Such folds are well exposed in metasediments at the damsite ( Fig.

4).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#65:1> Axial-surface orientations are highly vari <l> able, but hinges

plunge shallowly towards the east or northeast ( Fig. 3 <it> b </it> ) .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#66:1> A weak crenulation of micas is locally observed parallel to the fold

hinges but at an angle to the mylonitic stretching lineation, particularly

near hinge zones.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#67:1> The late structures refold earlier structures but are usually

distinguish <l> able from the earlier folds by their more open form (

interlimb angles near 90&degree;) and by their round hinge zones ( Lane 1984

<it> a </it> , Fig. 7).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#68:1> The folds described here are disrupted and offset by the brittle

extensional-fault zone ( Lane 1984 <it> a </it> ) . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#69:1> The late-stage folds are relative time markers because they

deform mylonitic textures in the quartzite units, unlike the earlier tight to

isoclinal minor folds where the quartz-shape fabric is axial planar.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#70:1> The late folds are continuous across the damsite and involve the

entire succession below the principal gouge zone of the Eocene brittle fault

( Fig. 4) ( Lane 1984 <it> a </it> ) . </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#71:1> <h> <it> Microstructures </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#72:1> Samples for microstructural and petrofabric analysis were

collected from the following localities: ( <it> i </it> ) Revelstoke damsite

and adjacent exposures, ( <it> ii </it> ) south of La Forme Creek, ( <it> iii

</it> ) south of Carnes Creek and ( <it> iv </it> ) south of Mars Creek (

Fig. 2).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#73:1> Locali <l> ties ( <it> i </it> ) and ( <it> ii </it> ) include

samples from the Monashee Complex and Clachnacudainn Slice and intervening

tectonically emplaced lozenges that were possibly derived from the hang <l>

ing wall.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#74:1> Localities ( <it> iii </it> ) and ( <it> iv </it> ) include samples

from the Monashee Complex and tectonic lozenges only, as hanging-wall

Goldstream Slice phyllites and interlayered carbonates are not extensively

mylonitized. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#75:1> Mylonitic textures are best developed in the Clachnacudainn

granitoids and siliceous units in the tectonic lozenges and foot-wall ( Fig.

5).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#76:1> Protomylonitic textures are present near the margins of the zone and

in thin quartz-rich layers enclosed by less competent biotite schists.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#77:1> A foliation parallel to composi <l> tional layering is defined by

muscovite plates and thin solution seams containing very fine mica.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#78:1> Their planarity and con <l> tinuity indicate that they are local

planes of relatively high strain ( C planes of Berth&eacute; <it> et al </it> .

1979) parallel to the mylonitic shear plane ( Fig. 6). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#79:1> Biotite in the pelitic schists is recrystallized, so the meso <l>

scopic fabric is not mylonitic ( i.e., reduced in grain size in relation to

the protolith) but merely anastomoses around plagioclase, garnet, or kyanite

porphyroclasts.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#80:1> Quartz aggre <l> gates normally define ribbons elongate in the

lineation, but the grains are much coarser than quartz grains in the

siliceous layers.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#81:1> Irregular lobate grain boundaries and equidimensional grain shapes of

quartz that locally overgrow mylonitic laminae indicate that thermally

activated grain growth postdated major shearing ( Fig. 7 <it> a </it> ) .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#82:1> However, well-developed equant to elon <l> gate subgrains and partial

to nearly complete dynamic recrystallization of quartz ( Figs. 6 <it> a </it> .

7 <it> b </it> ) , together with micro <l> shears in the biotite matrix (

Fig. 7 <it> b </it> ) , indicate a later reactiva <l> tion.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#83:1> Shear-band foliations ( <w> C' </w> fabrics) are also well developed

locally ( e.g., Fig. 6 <it> d </it> ) .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#84:1> Lineations are defined in pelites by elongation of biotite

aggregates.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#85:1> Kyanite and sillimanite are also weakly to strongly aligned and

pulled apart parallel to the lineation ( Figs. 7 <it> b </it> - 7 <it> b

</it> ) .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#86:1> In siliceous layers the extension lineation is usually defined by

dismembered porphyroclasts or aggregates of plagioclase and locally

tourmaline ( Fig. 8 <it> a </it> ) . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#87:1> Some quartz grains form ribbons with aspect rations exceed <l>

ing 160:1 ( Lane 1984 <it> b </it> ) Thin carbonate units are completely

mylonitized, with equant grain sizes of 10&mu;m diameter.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-028#88:1> In single thin sections where quartz and carbonate layers are both

present the grain-size reduction of carbonite is complete, yet quartz layers

show protomylonitic textures. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-028#89:1> In sections cut perpendicular to the foliation and parallel to

the lineation, the sense of asymmetry of microstructures in a

simple-shear-strain environment is an indicator os sense of shear ( Ramsay

and Graham 1970; Berth&eacute; <it> et al </it> . 1979; David <l> son <it> et

al </it> . 1982; Simpson and Schmid 1983; Passchier and Simpson 1986). </p>
