<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#57:1:A> Okay

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#62:1:A> <[> Okay okay </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#63:1:B> And then went from there uhm <,> we were in uhm <,> Kyoto for

three days <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-058#64:1:B> And uh we were at uh uh <,,> uhh <,,> just <,> between Kyoto and

<ICE-CAN:S1A-058#65:1:B> Can't recall the name of <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}>

community
<ICE-CAN:S1A-058#66:1:B> But <,,> they <}> <-> <.> h </.> </-> <=> have </=> </}> uhm <,>

huge strawberry houses there

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#67:1:A> Strawberry houses

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#68:1:B> Strawberry houses in Japan are different
<ICE-CAN:S1A-058#69:1:B> They don't
<ICE-CAN:S1A-058#70:1:B> Like here when you know the strawberries ah <}> <-> <}> <-> <.>

fiel </.> </-> <+> field </+> </}> </-> <=> ah farmer </=> </}> you have huge

<{> <[> fields of strawberries right </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#71:1:A> <[> Right right right </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#72:1:B> But because of the uhm <,> uh the landscape in Japan you've

got <,,> agriculture areas all down each side but the spine of Japan is all

mountainous right

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#73:1:A> Right

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#74:1:B> And so <,,> <}> <-> they had to </-> <=> in order to have some

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#75:1:A> <[> Right </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#76:1:B> And so what they've done is all up the hillside <,> they've

terraced <{> <[> <,,> </[> up

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#77:1:A> <[> Right </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#78:1:B> And on each of these terraces they have like a dome shape uhh

uh made with uhh wire <,> uhm <,> <}> <-> <.> s </.> </-> <=> uhh supports

</=> </}> <{> <[> <,,> </[> and then like a plastic over top of it

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#79:1:A> <[> Okay </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#80:1:B> So that you could <,,> <}> <-> <.> s </.> </-> <=> uh sort

</=> </}> of semi stand up in these little houses
<ICE-CAN:S1A-058#81:1:B> And uh <,> within the house they have <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-058#82:1:B> It's almost like the cement abutments we have here
<ICE-CAN:S1A-058#83:1:B> And <}> <-> they're </-> <=> they're </=> </}> four high

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#84:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#85:1:B> And <,> where these cement <}> <-> <.> abutmen </.> </-> <+>

abutments </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-058#86:1:B> You know how it'll go along flat and then it has a dip in it

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#87:1:A> Mhh hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#88:1:B> Well this goes along flat for a short distance maybe six or

eight inches and then there's a dip
<ICE-CAN:S1A-058#89:1:B> And within that dip is where the soil is <,> and the strawberry

plants are there
<ICE-CAN:S1A-058#90:1:B> And so they hang out <,> from the <{> <[> cement </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#91:1:A> <[> Right </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#92:1:B> Well <,> the sun heats <,> through <{> <[> that plastic </[>

onto the cement

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#93:1:A> <[> I see </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#94:1:B> The cement <,> causes <}> <-> another </-> <=> <,> excess </=>

</}> heat and so <,> they ripen quite quickly
<ICE-CAN:S1A-058#95:1:B> And their season goes from January to <&> end of tape </&> </I>


<I>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-058#96:2:B> By the way <}> <-> when uh </-> <=> <,> when </=> </}> I was
