<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-021#1:1:A> It is a history however that has to be told
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#2:1:A> The government takes this issue very seriously and is looking into

how best to set the record straight and to symbolize our recognition of this

sad event <,> this very sad event in our history
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#3:1:A> Madame Speaker in more recent times the government of Canada has

acted to protect its citizens from this kind of treatment <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#4:1:A> The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees equal

protection <,> and benefit of the law without discrimination
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#5:1:A> Through the Canadian Multiculturalism Act the parliament of Canada

has recognized that our society is fundamentally multicultural <,> in nature

and has committed itself to the full and equitable participation of

individuals and communities of all origins in shaping Canada's future
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#6:1:A> The War <}> <-> <.> A </.> </-> <=> Measures </=> </}> Act as an

example <,> Madame Speaker has been repealed by this government <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#7:1:A> Encouraged to immigrate to Canada by Canadian governments Ukrainians

were a vital part of the settlement process of Canada <,> particularly in the

prairies
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#8:1:A> Ukrainian <}> <-> <.> settle </.> </-> <=> settlers </=> </}> in the

prairies Madame Speaker <,> wanted no more than the chance to live and work

in the indignity <}> <-> in this country </-> <=> in this country of Canada

</=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#9:1:A> The Ukrainians were among the founding settlers of Canada especially

important in settling the prairies
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#10:1:A> Between eighteen ninety-one and nineteen fourteen one hundred and

seventy thousand <}> <-> <.> yur </.> </-> <+> Ukrainians </+> </}> <,> one

hundred and seventy thousand came to Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#11:1:A> And between the wars another sixty-eight thousand Ukrainians came

to Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#12:1:A> And after the Great War thirty-three thousand more <}> <-> <.> U

</.> </-> <+> Ukrainians </+> </}> immigrated to Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#13:1:A> Ukrainians did settle however in small numbers in Canada long

before the mass <}> <-> migration </-> <=> or immigration </=> </}> that took

place in eighteen ninety-one
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#14:1:A> According to the publication the Canadian Family Tree there were

soldiers of Ukrainian origin in the De Meuron and De Wattville regiments

which fought for Canada in the War of Eighteen Twelve
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#15:1:A> Some Ukrainians settled <}> <-> in this <,> in this time period

</-> <=> before this time period </=> </}> actually during the period <}> <->

of </-> <=> of </=> </}> Lord Selkirk in Manitoba <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#16:1:A> There're also Ukrainians who settled in Manitoba coming from the

United States prior to eighteen ninety-one
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#17:1:A> Madame Speaker in the beginning the Ukrainians faced a very

difficult life in the prairies as they broke into this land and broke the

land itself
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#18:1:A> In spite of this harsh existence community cultural and social life

grew with a variety of organizations
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#19:1:A> Womens' groups newspapers and periodicals architecture <,> folk

arts and poetry developed <,> over the years
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#20:1:A> In nineteen oh five the Ukrainian Mutual Benefit Association was

founded <,> in affiliation with the Saint Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Church

in Winnipeg
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#21:1:A> Among these Ukrainian workers and farmers there emerged a credit

union movement which began in nineteen thirty-nine when the New Community

Savings and Credit Union was founded in Saskatoon
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#22:1:A> And by the end of the nineteen sixties over sixty Ukrainian credit

unions served an estimated membership of fifty thousand people
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#23:1:A> Over time the Ukrainian-Canadians like their fellow <}> <->

citizens </-> <=> citizens </=> </}> had become an urban people
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#24:1:A> According to the nineteen eighty-one census there were <,>

sixty-three thousand Ukrainians in Edmonton <,,> fifty-nine thousand in

Winnipeg <,,> fifty-one thousand in Toronto <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#25:1:A> Other major centres of Ukrainian population are Vancouver <,>

Montreal Calgary Saskatoon Hamilton <,> Thunder Bay Regina and the Niagara

Peninsula
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#26:1:A> Of the five hundred and twenty-nine thousand six hundred and

fifteen Ukrainians in Canada in nineteen nine uh excuse me Madame Speaker

nineteen eighty-one fifty-nine percent lived in the prairie provinces <,> and

twenty-five point three percent lived in Ontario
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#27:1:A> Much of the cultural struggle for the Ukrainian-Canadian community

<}> <-> was </-> <=> <,> has </=> </}> involved the maintenance of its

language
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#28:1:A> In recent years bilingual and even trilingual education with <,>

French <,> teaching included Madame Speaker has been offered in the publicly

supported education systems of the prairie provinces <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#29:1:A> Ukrainians are a vital part of the cultural fabric of Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#30:1:A> To quote from the Ukrainian Community Development Committee Report

for the prairie regions published in nineteen eighty-six by the <}> <-> <.>

Ukai </.> </-> <=> Ukrainian </=> </}> - Canadian Committee <,> the Ukrainian

situation as an ethno-cultural minority is a very special one <,> permanently

woven into the fabric of Canadian society <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#31:1:A> Over one thousand organizations exist within the Ukrainian

community
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#32:1:A> The painting of uh William Kurelek <,> inspired by his experience

on the <}> <-> <.> pare </.> </-> <=> prairies </=> </}> have been widely

recognized and George Ryga is a writer of Ukrainian origin of a national <?>

stature </?> Madame Speaker
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#33:1:A> Ukrainians have long been involved in municipal politics as well
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#34:1:A> William Hawrelak in Edmonton and Steven Juba in Winnipeg have been

prominent mayors and the first Ukrainian elected to the provincial

legislature was Andrew Shandro in nineteen thirteen <,> in Alberta
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#35:1:A> In nineteen twenty-six Michael Luchkovich became the first

Ukrainian elected to the House of Commons
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#36:1:A> Over two hundred Ukrainian-Canadians have been elected provincially
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#37:1:A> Another sixty have been elected to the House of Commons
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#38:1:A> In nineteen seventy <,> Stephen Worobetz became the Lieutenant

Governor <}> <-> of <.> S </.> </-> <=> of Saskatchewan </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#39:1:A> And of course a former honourable member of this House His

Excellency Ray Hnatyshyn now serves the country as Governor General <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#40:1:A> And Madame Speaker during the Second World War approximately forty

thousand Ukrainian-Canadians served in the Canadian Armed Forces <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#41:1:A> Ukrainian-Canadians form a vital part of Canadian life
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#42:1:A> They are important exponents of recognition of the multicultural

nature of Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#43:1:A> We must not forget however the history of the treatment <}> <-> of

</-> <=> of </=> </}> Ukrainians that took place during the First World War
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#44:1:A> We must ensure that present <,> and future generations of Canadians

understand the reality of Canadian history <,> including events such as

Ukrainian internment
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#45:1:A> Many Canadians are unaware the details of these events <}> <-> or

</-> <=> or </=> </}> even <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#46:1:A> They are even unaware Madame Speaker that they took place
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#47:1:A> They are seldom mentioned in the official history books <,> or in

museum exhibits <,> or in popular press reports about historical events
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#48:1:A> Madame Speaker I'm grateful to the honourable member for <,> this

motion and for the occasion to speak about the Ukrainian internment
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#49:1:A> More important Madame Speaker I'm grateful for those members of the

Ukrainian-Canadian community for increasing public awareness about this

history
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#50:1:A> Without this knowledge of history we risk repeating the same kinds

of mistakes <,> whenever world crises break out <,> or stoke the embers of

fear and intolerance
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#51:1:A> In one of the most important conclusions of the Spicer Committee

<,> Report last summer was that Canadians need a greater knowledge of their

history and of themselves and of each other
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#52:1:A> And Madame Speaker if we are to remain together as a country <}>

<-> we <.> wa </.> </-> <=> we must </=> </}> encourage the recounting and

the hearing of our histories
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#53:1:A> Thank you Madame Speaker

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-021#54:1:Z> <O> Introduce next speaker </O>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-021#55:1:B> Yes
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#56:1:B> Thank you uh Madame Speaker
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#57:1:B> Uh <,> I attended a meeting on behalf of the Minister uhh I guess

it would be probably about a year and a half ago at which the Ukrainian

Redress Committee uhh had a press conference and uh basically told their

story
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#58:1:B> And I think it's a story that <,> is the story of a minority in

Canada that still hurts
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#59:1:B> So I think that this motion that uh Mister Milliken has presented

is one that should be given every consideration by the government
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#60:1:B> The government is committed to doing something to redress this uh

historical wrong committed by <}> <-> previous </-> <=> a previous </=> </}>

uh government of Canada and I think that the suggestions of Mister Milliken

are certainly excellent ones that should be given every consideration so I

will certainly support the referral <,> of the motion
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#61:1:B> Thank you <,,>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S2B-021#62:1:C> Point of order Madame Speaker

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-021#63:1:Z> <O> allows C to speak </O>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S2B-021#64:1:C> Madame Speaker I wanted to thank <}> <-> the honourable member

for </-> <=> all honourable members </=> </}> the <}> <-> <w> honemeber </w>

</-> <+> honourable member </+> </}> for Burlington Edmonton-East

Carleton-Charlotte and Don Valley-North for their kind interventions
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#65:1:C> <}> <-> And I </-> <=> since </=> </}> there is <}> <-> <.> unan

</.> </-> <=> unanimity </=> </}> on this point I wonder <,> if uh rather

than drop the motion it could be uh carried by unanimous consent <,,>

<$ZA> <ICE-CAN:S2B-021#66:1:Z> <O> agrees </O>

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-021#67:1:Z> <O> conducts vote and carries motion </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#68:1:Z> <O> ends parliamentary session </O> </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-021#69:2:A> And you're listening to Radio Noon
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#70:2:A> My name is <@> Mary Henny </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#71:2:A> It is now three degrees in downtown Montreal
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#72:2:A> I'm going to give you the forecast in uh just a moment or so but

first I want to tell you what's on the program today
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#73:2:A> Uhm <}> <-> there uh is <}> <-> <.> th </.> </-> <+> this </+> <}>

</-> <=> it is </=> </}> becoming <}> <-> <}> <-> <.> stran </.> </-> <+>

stranger </+> <}> </-> <=> curiouser and curiouser </=> </}> about what might

have happened on referendum night in terms of the voting
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#74:2:A> We have been following quite closely the issue of spoiled ballots
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#75:2:A> Now there comes allegations that ah some of the votes were switched
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#76:2:A> Yes and No votes <}> <-> were </-> <=> were </=> </}> switched
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#77:2:A> We're going to be speaking with <@> Johnston Smithfield </@> who's

an investigative reporter at the Gazette
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#78:2:A> He has uncovered <}> <-> these uh </-> <=> these </=> </}>

allegations
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#79:2:A> We're going to find out more from him about what it might mean
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#80:2:A> <@> David Finnigan </@> has this story of a signmaker
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#81:2:A> It's a woman who makes these wooden signs in her basement
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#82:2:A> And <@> David </@> will have that story for us
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#83:2:A> It is Tuesday and we have the Radio Noon Farm Panel
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#84:2:A> And on the phone-in today would you buy private <,> homecare

insurance
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#85:2:A> I've heard time and time again on this program mostly since the uhh

news of the hospital closures came out in the spring <,> people calling in

very afraid of what that might mean
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#86:2:A> Because as you know the regional health boards are saying that this

is part of an entire restructuring of healthcare
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#87:2:A> That too many people are spending too much time <,> in hospital
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#88:2:A> We don't need so many hospitals
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#89:2:A> Close some down have the hospital stay <,,> shortened and have

people sent home to recover and recuperate
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#90:2:A> <}> <-> And </-> <=> and </=> </}> there's a lot of wisdom in that
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#91:2:A> People are a lot more comfortable at home
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#92:2:A> Course the big question is <,,> who looks after them <,> at home
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#93:2:A> Most of these people <,> after an operation <}> <-> or </-> <=> or

</=> </}> any sort of treatment probably aren't capable of looking after

themselves
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#94:2:A> Particularly if you're elderly and if you're alone
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#95:2:A> There's a lot of fear out there
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#96:2:A> Fear fuelled as well by the fact that if you call up the C L S C

today <,> <&> centre local de services communautaires ( clinics) </&> chances

are they won't be able to send you anyone
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#97:2:A> But the C L S C's say that it'll get better <,> as you heard <@>

John Peggoty </@> reporting today
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#98:2:A> Uh they are going to be getting considerably more money
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#99:2:A> A lot of that is going to go into home care and they say it's going

to improve
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#100:2:A> But <,,> we also hear today from Blue Cross <,> which is a private

healthcare company <,> and it says that it is going to step in where it sees

a need
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#101:2:A> And it is offering private homecare insurance
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#102:2:A> For <}> <-> seventy dollars more <,> a year <,> if you already

have one of their plans <,> </-> <=> seventy dollars more a year </=> </}>

you can guarantee that someone will come in to your home and look after you

<,,> if you are sick if you're sent home from the hospital
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#103:2:A> A lot of people find that a very attractive offer
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#104:2:A> C L S C's <}> <-> are <.> c </.> </-> <=> are </=> </}> screaming

foul saying <}> <-> that is </-> <=> that will </=> </}> completely undermine

them
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#105:2:A> It's going to create this two-tiered system where the wealthy <,>

get uh homecare <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> the poorer don't get

homecare
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#106:2:A> A whole lot of issues
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#107:2:A> Our question for you would you buy <,> private homecare insurance
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#108:2:A> That's next hour on the phone-in
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#109:2:A> And in fact we're going <,,> to start the discussion just before

one o'clock <,> when I speak to someone from Blue Cross to find out more

about what it is that they are offering </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#110:3:A> Now if you were sent home early after an operation at the hospital

do you trust that the C L S C <&> centre local de services communautaires (

clinics) </&> would be able to send you someone to help you recuperate
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#111:3:A> The Blue Cross private health insurance uh company doesn't think

so
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#112:3:A> So it has set up a private policy
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#113:3:A> It is a private homecare insurance and it has people really

steamed at the C L S Cs
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#114:3:A> Our question next hour <,> would you buy <,> private homecare

insurance <O> Music, drum roll at end </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#115:3:A> <O> laugh </O> Now you knew that was coming
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#116:3:A> The beauty of it is you don't know quite when
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#117:3:A> It's three degrees right now in downtown Montreal
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#118:3:A> Storm on the way overnight
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#119:3:A> Fifteen centimetres of snow expected
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#120:3:A> Seventy kilometre an hour winds
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#121:3:A> Uh by tomorrow morning it's supposed to change into ice pellets

and freezing rain and rain by noon tomorrow
<ICE-CAN:S2B-021#122:3:A> But a really bad night expected tonight in ah the Montreal

Chateauguay <}> <-> <.> a </.> </-> <=> and </=> </}> townships as well as

the Laurentiens area </I>
