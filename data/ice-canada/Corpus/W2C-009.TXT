<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#1:1> <h> <bold> Concordia shut out of student film fest </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#2:1> by Kate Kung

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#3:1> Every year the World Film Festival whizzes into town for a twelve

day cinephile-a-thon.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#4:1> Having been absorbed into the WFFs grand event, the Canadian Student

Film Festival has enjoyed a higher visibility and status. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#5:1> A substantial number of films are <}> <-> recieved </-> <+>

received </+> </}> every year at festival central in the belly of the Hall

building.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#6:1> The quality of the films is often reflected in the reactions from the

audience which too often include groans and polite applause. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#7:1> It is a shame though when this is heard during the screening of

the winning films. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#8:1> The restrained crowd may be the result of the hometeams - <indig>

Universit&eacute; de Montr&eacute;al </indig> and Concordia - being

completely shut-out of the winner's circle.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#9:1> Aside from Concordia's Oliver Slupecki's " Tidings of Joy" which

received an honourable mention in the fiction film category, all the winners

heralded from Vancouver and Toronto. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#10:1> There was a buzz among francophone student filmmakers about the

consistant lack of <indig> quebecois </indig> judges and its correlation with

the absence of francophone winners.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#11:1> In spite of the fear of being pegged, in her own words, as a <quote> "

<indig> fleur-de-lys </indig> maniac" </quote> , a student expressed her

frustration that the Canadian student film fest did not reflect a Canada

which included Quebec. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#12:1> It is rather questionable if the festival reflected Canadian

filmmaking at all. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#13:1> Granted we're not as extreme as our neighbours down south, but

our great Canadian multi-cultural pot stews just as vigorously.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#14:1> Despite a vigorous political and social environment, the majority of

the films dealt with very few issues which had any resemblance to anything

distinctly Canadian. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#15:1> The Norman McLaren prize, a &dollar;1000 bonanza offered by the

National Film Board, went to Simon Fraser University's Trent Carlson and

Robert Aschman for " Round the Corner". </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#16:1> Jane Milroy from Simon Fraser in B.C. walked away with the best

experimental film award for " Geometria".
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#17:1> U.B.C. student Frederik Thorsen tied for the fiction award with "

Wake Linda" - a film about paternal domination and punishment based on a true

story.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#18:1> Fellow U.B.C. student Joshua Gross shared the prize with " Learning

to Dance", a tiresome chase film with a dance sequence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#19:1> The best documentary prize went to York University's Earl Kisluk

for " Wayne McLean: Mouthpiecous Extraordinarous" </quote> , a film about a

radio show host who makes Terry DiMonte seem tight-lipped and humble.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#20:1> Kisluk also received a special mention for his film " The Last Draw".

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#21:1> Bad news for animation fans.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#22:1> Only one animated film was entered this year.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#23:1> The judges, feeling that it was not strong enough an entry to warrant

an award, phased out the category for this year. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#24:2> <h> <bold> Rugby team has new look </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#25:2> <bold> by Einar Murchison </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#26:2> This years edition of the men's rugby football club should prove

to be <}> <-> it's <-> <+> its </+> </}> most successful yet. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#27:2> Under the guidance of New Zealander Greg Thaggard, ( also the

coach of the Quebec provincial all-star team) the Stingers are expected to

forcefully contest for the Quebec University Rugby League crown. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#28:2> Thaggard has managed to persuade one of Great Britain's top wing

forwards to join the Concordia team.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#29:2> Alan Phillips, a former first division player for the London Saracens

has decided to play at Concordia. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#30:2> If you're not <}> <-> to </-> <+> too </+> </}> familiar with

rugby and are wondering just how much of a difference this Phillips fellow

will make to rugby at Concordia, just try and imagine the effect that Mark

Messier would make if he decided to play hockey for a university team in

England. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#31:2> Phillips brings with him almost twenty years of experience and

his presence on the field should help Concordia overcome its poor sister

image against Mc Gill and Bishops. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#32:2> Apart from newcomer Phillips, Con U can count on the return of

Geoff ( Bunny) Delorme to lead a young but well seasoned pack. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#33:2> Concordia will boast one of Eastern Canada's best back rows with

Alan Phillips, Delorme, Andrew Duffield, and Vince Nixon competing for three

positions.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#34:2> All four players gained representative honours this summer playing

for the Quebec all-stars.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#35:2> So intense is the competition for his starting spot that Duffield,

who was last year's captain, is in danger of losing his job. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#36:2> But Duffield isn't pretentious, he knows that in spite of his

obvious ability, he may not be a full time player in what could be Con U

rugby's finest season ever.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#37:2> Duffield has given up his title as captain and for the sake of the

club has taken on the added responsibility of serving as its interim

President. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#38:2> In many ways Duffield represents all that is good about rugby.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#39:2> His love of the game won't allow him to ignore his <}> <->

responsibilites </-> <+> responsibilities </+> </}> to the club through his

position as interim president, and at the same time he's willing to give up

his role as the team's captain. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#40:2> Rugby at Concordia has long been regarded as a second rate

priority by the planners and staff in the university's athletic department.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#41:2> In the past, high profile sports like football and basketball

have benefited from the affection and attention bestowed upon them by the

athletic department.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#42:2> This institutionalized favouritism has made it <}> <-> dificult </->

<+> difficult </+> </}> for less-regarded teams like the men's rugby team to

aspire to a higher level of success. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#43:2> Unlike the majority of varsity teams at Con U, the rugby team

counts on its members to ensure that the sport grows and thrives at the

school. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#44:2> " The rugby team tends to rely on itself," says Owen Falquero, a

three year veteran.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#45:2> " Not because we really want to, or enjoy it, but because if you want

to play, you have to organize the games and make sure everything is in

order." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#46:2> Concordia's rugby program finds itself at a crossroad.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#47:2> It has corralled a top flight coach and at least one player is likely

to play for Canada within the next year.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#48:2> But if rugby at Concordia is ever to rise above <}> <-> it's </-> <+>

its </+> </}> second-class status then more players like Andrew Duffield must

step forward and hope that their enthusiasm for the game rubs off on the

movers and shakers of the athletics department. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#50:3> <h> <bold> Unnecessary violence at Faubourg <bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#51:3> <bold> by Eugenia Xenos </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#52:3> Faubourg security guards roughed up a Concordia student when he

demanded to know why his friend was being detained. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#53:3> The incident took place Aug. 10 at the Faubourg Ste. Catherine,

where students often go to eat.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#54:3> Kenneth Huck, 26, and two friends had eaten lunch and were shopping

individually when Huck noticed one friend, Nick Vasil, flanked by four

security guards. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#55:3> Huck walked over to find out what was happening, and demanded to

know if Vasil was under arrest and for what reason. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#56:3> According to Huck, a stout, bearded, fair-haired guard refused to

answer, and instead used his belly to push Huck.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#57:3> Huck was then told that Vasil had been stopped for allegedly

shoplifting a bottle of juice, but the charge was dropped. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#58:3> " Huck didn't commit any crime," said witness Jonathan Carrigan,

a Plantation fruit store employee.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#59:3> " He just saw his friend in trouble and jumped in to help." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#60:3> Twenty-year-old Carrigan de <l> scribed the security guards as

being <quote> " extra rough" </quote> and using <quote> " excessive force"

</quote> on Huck. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#61:3> " At one point, the guards pushed, tripped him down and dragged

him by the cuff of his shirt ( with) Huck's head hitting against a wall, con

<l> crete pillar, and some mailboxes," said Carrigan. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#62:3> Huck said he was also handcuffed roughly, kicked and struck in

the face while he was handcuffed on the floor. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#63:3> Huck added that he lost feeling in parts of his thumb after a

tall, dark-haired guard with a buzz-cut named Dominic twisted Huck's wrist.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#64:3> About twenty people witnessed the incident. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#65:3> Nino Bruni, project manager for Reemark-Faubourg ( the private

company that owns the Faubourg) said he could not comment until he meets with

Huck. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#66:3> Huck said he will press charges against the company unless it

agrees to have its guards trained properly.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#67:3> He said none identified themselves by name, position or as a security

guard.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#68:3> Huck also said the guards never told him he was under arrest, or gave

any reasons for detaining or handcuffing him. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#69:3> Huck himself was a security guard for Canadian Security Agency

for 18 months. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#70:3> " I really don't want to sue them," said Huck.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#71:3> " But I want to see changes.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#72:3> I will agree not to sue them if Reemark undertakes to train all

guards." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#73:3> The company would not give the four <w> guards' </w> names, but

one was stout, bearded and fair-haired; the second was a tall, dark-haired

thin man with a buzz-cut; the third was a tall, young, blond man; and the man

in red was short and slightly balding. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#74:3> A search at Montreal's court <l> house did not reveal other

lawsuits against the company, but Carrigan said that guards often kick people

out ( especially if they're unkempt) even if they're not doing anything

wrong. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#75:3> " But little old women who don't look suspicious get away with

steal <l> ing ( fruit) all the time," said Carri <l> gan, who's worked at

Plantation for three years. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#76:3> " Scruffy-looking people are auto <l> matically treated like shit

( by the guards.)
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#77:3> Security is just a bit too gung-ho." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#78:3> Both Huck and Angelos Droso <l> poulos ( the other friend) were

charged by MUC police with as <l> sault.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#79:3> They face a preliminary hear <l> ing Nov.8 </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#80:4> <h> <bold> Students don't have to pay CUSACORP fee </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#81:4> <bold> by Shelley Wolcott </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#82:4> Concordia students voted last year to give CUSACORP 25 cents per

credit on top of the &dollar; 1.60 CUSA fee they already pay - but no one's

collecting it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#83:4> The cancellation of the fee is due to controversy surrounding

last semester's CUSACORP referen <l> dum: a referendum CUSA co-presi <l> dent

Charlene Nero called <quote> " a lot of bunk." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#84:4> It was held at the same time as the <w> co-presidents' </w>

election to decide whether to add the 25 cent fee.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#85:4> The money would have raised an extra &dollar;80,000 for CUSACORP,

allow <l> ing it to be financially autonomous from CUSA </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#86:4> The legality of last semester's referendum is in question for two

major reasons.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#87:4> The first is that all Concordia students were allowed to vote for a

fee which would be paid only by Arts <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> Science

and Fine Arts students. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#88:4> Commerce and Administration and Engineering and Computer Science

students pay a fee to their own student associations ( CASA and ECA

respectively), and none to CUSA. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#89:4> Secondly, it is unclear whether it was legal for Shawn O'Hara,

who worked as a programmer for CU <l> SACORP last semester, to work on the

campaign.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#90:4> He headed up the <mention> " Yes" </mention> campaign in the

referendum.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#91:4> According to CUSA judicial board guidelines, it is illegal to pay any

<l> one to campaign. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#92:4> O'Hara could not be reached for comment. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#93:4> Co-presidents Nero and Eleanor Brown will be appointing a

judicial board of students to discuss the legitimacy of the campaign and to

decide if the judicial board guide <l> line applies to O'Hara. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#94:4> CUSACORP, formed in 1984 by members of CUSA, was intended to be a

student-run, profit-making organization.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#95:4> The corporation op <l> erates Mugshots Caf&eacute;, Reggie's Pub, The

Dive, Used Bookstores, Games Rooms and the Loyola Campus Centre. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#96:4> CUSACORP receives its annual budget from CUSA and uses it to

operate and maintain these facili <l> ties.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#97:4> Renovations to Reggie's, Mugshots and the Dive in the Loyola Campus

Centre are just a few of the plans CUSACORP presi <l> dent Darren Porter has

in store for this year. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#98:4> CUSACORP has been plagued by financial problems since its

inception and has failed to turn a profit during its seven years in ex <l>

istence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#99:4> Last year, the corporation had a deficit of &dollar;50,000.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#100:4> Porter says that a &dollar;50,000 loss <quote> " isn't that much in

a historical context since CU <l> SACORP has lost a lot more in former

years." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#101:4> CUSA, which is funded by stu <l> dent money, has to pay for

CUSACORP's overdrafts. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-009#102:4> Nero <}> <-> sights </-> <+> cites </+> </}> many of CUSACORP'S

problems as being managerial.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#103:4> She and Brown plan a complete restructuring of CUSACORP's management

this year.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-009#104:4> With this restructuring, Nero said her <quote> " worst case scenario

for this year is a loss of &dollar;8,000." </quote> </p> </I>
