<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#1:1> <h> Analysis of the Dream Text: </h>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#2:1> <h> Conrad's <ul> Heart of Darkness </ul> and Coleridge's <ul> Kubla

Khan </ul> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-009#3:1> The word <mention> 'dream' </mention> is by nature an ambiguous

one that involves an obvious aspect of duality.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#4:1> It can imply hopes, aspirations and desires as a verb, while at the

same time refer to those inner, irrational images we experience in sleep as a

noun.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#5:1> A particular dream then may encompass both of these aspects, but does

not necessarily require so by definition.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#6:1> In addition, it is important to remember that dreams during sleep can

be either pleasant { good) or disturbing ( bad).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#7:1> Furthermore, in utilizing dreams the author achieves very significant

effects, in comparison to the traditionally rationale and logical style of

writing.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#8:1> Such is the case with Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and Samuel

Coleridge's <ul> Kubla Khan </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#9:1> Each use the concept of dreams in unique ways, and in doing so

accomplish different effects.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#10:1> In this essay, I will examine these two literary works as dream texts

and discuss the ramifications of writing a text in the random, non-linear,

associative manner of dreams. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-009#11:1> The first text I will examine is that of Conrad's <ul> Heart of

Darkness </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#12:1> Dreams in this text can be examined in many ways.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#13:1> There exists both a sense of the sleeping dreams, and the aspiration

or hope-type dreams.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#14:1> Conrad accomplishes tasks through the use of dreams that he would not

be able to in other methods of discourse; specifically through the ambiguity

of dreams themselves. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-009#15:1> Chronologically, dreams are first made reference to through the

character of Marlow.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#16:1> During his pastime of looking at maps, he speaks of dreams in the

sense of having a hope to go places in the world for adventure: <quote> " ...I

would put my finger on it and say, When I grow up I will go there...But there

was one yet - the biggest, the most blank so to speak - that I had a

hankering after [ Africa]." </quote> ( Conrad, p. 33)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#17:1> Through this first introduction to dreams, it becomes apparent that

Marlow has an initial attraction to the continent of Africa, and constitutes

part of his wanting to go there.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#18:1> Hence, Conrad uses this dream to somewhat explain the story in more

realistic ways.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#19:1> The fact that Marlow has always wanted to go there, makes it all the

more likely for the reader to accept his decision to enter a wild and savage

place.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#20:1> What results, is a greater proximity to the 'inner' make-up of

Marlow's character. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-009#21:1> A further instance whereby the word <mention> 'dream' </mention>

is used as a verb, is Marlow's relentless drive to meet Kurtz; who Marlow is

told is <quote> " a very remarkable man" </quote> by the accountant.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#22:1> However, this borders on the other meaning of dream in that it

reaches a very personal level.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#23:1> Ostensibly, it could be argued that the story is about Marlow's dream

to meet Kurtz.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#24:1> It is strongly suggested that the meeting of Kurtz is in fact

Marlow's dream, in the following citing, whereby he first meets Kurtz:

<quote> <X> " I looked at him lost in astonishment...His very existence was

improbable, inexplicable and altogether bewildering.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#X25:1> It was inconceivable how he had existed...how he had managed to

remain - why he did not instantly disappear." </X> </quote> ( Conrad, p.93).

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-009#26:1> Marlow makes specific reference to Kurtz being the dream.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#27:1> As is the case when one wakes up from a dream, the images of the

dream usually disappear and fade away.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#28:1> We somehow lose connection with the feelings we had been experiencing

only moments before, the manifest content of the dream.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#29:1> Kurtz then, resembles the state of being in a dream, but Marlow can

not understand why he does not <quote> 'instantly disappear' </quote> , and

labels his existence as <quote> 'improbable' </quote> as are most images

within dreams. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-009#30:1> To Marlow then, Kurtz resembles a dream taken to its furthest

extent and includes both definitions of the ambiguous word <mention> 'dream'

</mention> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#31:1> While Kurtz can represent an aspiration of a great man he wishes to

meet, Marlow also sees this as a dream, that he somehow can not ever meet

Kurtz in reality.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#32:1> When he does meet him, it is beyond his comprehension and he is very

set back by it.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#33:1> A notion then exists that Marlow's dream has come true in reality.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#34:1> This represents a pleasantry for Marlow, and is an instance of a good

dream. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-009#35:1> In contrast to this is Kurtz's dream, to become very wealthy and

powerful, consequently at the expense of others.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#36:1> Again, this is a dream in the verb sense.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#37:1> One can come to this conclusion based on his callous treatment of the

natives, as well as the fact that he had <quote> " collected, bartered,

swindled, or stolen more ivory than all the other agents together" </quote> (

Conrad, p. 83)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#38:1> Kurtz has complete disregard for all others, as evidenced by his

power exertion over the natives, and the very fact that he threatened to kill

a man to get a small amount of ivory.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#39:1> So, consumed by his dream for wealth and power, Kurtz will kill a man

in the progressing towards his dream.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#40:1> We learn of his great possessive character in our recollection of him

by the narrator: <quote> " You should have heard him say 'My ivory.' <X>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#X41:1> Oh, yes.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#X42:1> I heard him. 'My Intended, my ivory, my station, my river, my...' "

</X> </quote> ( Conrad, p. 85) </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-009#43:1> Later in the text, just before his death, Kurtz utters the

notorious words <quote> 'the horror, the horror.' </quote> In the scope of a

dream text, these words are strongly emblematic of a nightmare.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#44:1> Waking up from his 'dream', he experiences a recollection of what he

has done in his great attempt to fulfil his dream.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#45:1> The very nature of his actions against the natives come out in this

phrase.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#46:1> Linking this to dreams, one interpretation is that, again, this is

the immediate remembrance of one's dream that have occurred just a short time

ago.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#47:1> After awaking, a dream it is still fresh within one's memory, but

gradually fades away.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#48:1> Resultingly, a correlation with dreams themselves exists through

these famous words.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#49:1> To extend the metaphor there exists a vagueness of the words

themselves, much like the vagueness of a dream.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#50:1> It is in this way that Kurtz could be said to have awoke from a

nightmare, which is obviously deemed as the 'bad' dream. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-009#51:1> The major direct reference to dreams within <ul> Heart of

Darkness </ul> , is the one by Marlow in his attempt to somehow create an

image of Kurtz as a man
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#52:1> Marlow claims that <quote> " it is impossible to convey the life

sensation of any given epoch of one's existence - that which makes its truth,

its meaning - its subtle and penetrating essence. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#X53:1> It is impossible.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#X54:1> We live, as we dream - alone." </X> </quote> ( Conrad, p. 57)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#55:1> This is Marlow's best attempt to express the futility of ever

explaining your dreams to another person, and of language more broadly. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-009#56:1> Dreams then in <ul> Heart of Darkness </ul> are effective in that

they give a greater understanding of the characters of Marlow and Kurtz, as

well as the whole notion of the European colonization of Africa.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#57:1> The very fact that the story has taken place in the past, and that

some of the events are very dramatic and irrational, make it come across as

being a dream of the narrator.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#58:1> At one point in time, the narrator actually addresses the audience

and says: <quote> " Do you see him? <X> Do you see the story? Do you see

anything? It seems to me I am trying to tell you a dream" </X> </quote> (

Conrad, p. 57)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#59:1> Also the various absurd events throughout the novel, further

reinforce this idea.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#60:1> For instance the two women knitting yarn and the man measuring the

size of Marlow's head.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#61:1> Through dreams, Conrad makes the events of the novel more

understandable and allows us to comprehend the characters within it to a

greater extent. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-009#62:1> Within <ul> Kubla Khan </ul> use of dream is a critical aspect,

as it is the medium by which the 'story' is revealed.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#63:1> Such is the way that Coleridge wrote Kubla Khan, through his

involvement with the unconscious, as dreams themselves so involve.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#64:1> His use of dreams in poetry is unique in that he is essentially

proposing the writing in fragmentation as a fit and suitable style of poetry.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#65:1> Whereas Conrad's use of dream helps to define the nature of the

text's main characters, Coleridge use of dreams sends out a message.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#66:1> The driving theme of the poem is the loss of poetic vision.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#67:1> This is reinforced by the creation of the man from Porlock, whereby

Coleridge has lost over two hundred lines of 'inspiration' by his

disturbance.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#68:1> The very title of the poem itself suggests that this is a poem about

writing poetry. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-009#69:1> The opening movement in the poem is one of control.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#70:1> The King overlooks his pleasure dome, a place fit for kings.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#71:1> In this way, the outside world is cut off, much in the same way as

one is cut off from the outside world while in a dream.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#72:1> Furthermore, Kubla has built this place from his vision, it is a

world of cultivation whereby society is cut off from everything.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#73:1> The poem further develops in a very sexually suggestive fashion,

whereby there exists a relationship between Kubla and every facet of his

repressed ( forbidden) forces.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#74:1> Again, much as one's dreams are in reality.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#75:1> This forbidden force is represented by the woman at the bottom of the

falls, and further develops the theme of poetic vision as being momentary and

ephemeral. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-009#76:1> Coleridge then makes a final reflection on the role of the poet

within society, through the dream-text.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#77:1> He has tasted the divine and it has turned him into a demon.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#78:1> He perceives people as being jealous of this experience and he

becomes a self consumed monster.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#79:1> Dreams make it permissible for him to make the claim that society is

afraid of him; and that they try to keep him within the thunderdome as a

result.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#80:1> This is in direct conflict with any belief that he wants to be in the

thunderdome.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#81:1> Coleridge, in summation uses dreams as an easy medium to relay a

message to society concerning the loss of poetic vision. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-009#82:1> Dreams within Coleridge's text can be interpreted resultingly, in

much the same way as Sigmund Freud interpreted them in the 19th century; as

keys into the unconscious of the individual.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#83:1> To understand the world, Coleridge attends not to the present things

of the world but to that which is repressed, hidden away.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#84:1> Through dreams we collapse upon ourselves.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#85:1> We do not see beyond ourselves; to be oneself then is to be an exile.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#86:1> The exile condition being emblematic of what it means to be a person,

constantly alienated.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#87:1> Dreams offer a way to explore the alienation of individuals.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#88:1> The isolation and inability to fully comprehend ourselves, let alone

anyone else. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-009#89:1> This theme of alienation is apparent within <ul> Heart of

Darkness </ul> as well.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#90:1> When Marlow claims <quote> " we live as we dream - alone" </quote> ,

he is clearly revealing to the reader, that one can never get to the interior

of another individual.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#91:1> He states: <quote> " no relation of a dream can reveal the dream

sensation." </quote> ( Conrad, p. 57)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#92:1> This runs parallel to dreams in that dreaming is an individual

experience.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#93:1> Reference is being made to Kurtz, whereby he sees Kurtz only as a

name, and an enigma that can never be revealed or exposed by one's

recollection of them. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-009#94:1> In general, there are many effects that are achieved through the

creation of dream-texts.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#95:1> The creation of the irrational, random chaotic, and non-linearity of

the works definitely allows for a dissociation of the author from their work.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#96:1> Furthermore, it is a nice move to keep criticism at bay.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#97:1> This is especially so in Kubla Khan, where Coleridge can claim that

he did not write the poem, and that the poem was wrote through him, hence

having no legitimate author. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-009#98:1> Secondly, dreams allow for the extraordinary to become ordinary.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#99:1> The chaotic nature of dreams is reduced to a regularity; whereby what

is being expressed is not that chaotic at all.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#100:1> It makes the difficult and complex easy to comprehend, and in doing

so gives passage for the reader into realms they have not had previously had

simplified access to.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#101:1> This is one of Coleridge's most notable skills, and it allows for

the reader a greater ability to experience the irrational.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#102:1> Dreams give us access to the darker side of a person, the aspects of

the mind that are rejected and repressed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-009#103:1> In conclusion, Conrad's <ul> Heart of Darkness </ul> and

Coleridge's <ul> Kubla Khan </ul> , are dream texts in the purest sense.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#104:1> They both rely on dreams as essential literary tools in giving the

reader a deeper understanding of the text itself.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#105:1> Whereas Conrad uses dreams to reveal the inner makeup of his

characters, Coleridge uses dreams to create an analogy for the loss of poetic

vision, and hence to send out a message.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#106:1> The effect of writing their texts in the random, non-linear,

associative manner of dreams better allows for the accomplishment of their

purposes and is an integral aspect for the development of their respective

themes.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#107:1> Both also rely on the very essence of dreams in order to succeed.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#108:1> The individuality of dreams, and the fact that they are unaccessible

to others makes them all the more elusive in their understanding.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-009#109:1> The chaotic nature of the dream-text then requires a further

analysis of what is actually being expressed by the author, and in that sense

forces the reader to take an active role in its understanding. </p> </I>
