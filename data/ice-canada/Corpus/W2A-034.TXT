<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#3:1> <h> <bold> ABSTRACT </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#4:1> <it> A wind tunnel investigation has assessed the effects of

distributed upper-surface roughness, and leading-edge ice formation on a

powered wing propeller model. </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#5:1> <it> In the unpowered state, it was found that roughness reduces

the lift slope, and maximum lift by 30 to 50 percent, depending upon particle

size and Reynolds number.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#6:1> The leading edge region is especially sensitive to these disturbances;

however, removal of the roughness over a small portion of the nose restored

the wing to close to its original performance. </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#7:1> <it> The application of power to the wing, with an increase of

slipstream dynamic pressure, increases the lift slope and maxi <l> mum lift;

however, this benefit is lost if the wing is roughened.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#8:1> Subtraction of the propeller reactions indicated that the slipstream

interaction accounted for half the lift increase and also resulted in reduced

drag for the clean surface.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#9:1> This drag reduction was removed when the wing was roughened,

indicating that the degradation of wing performance due to roughening is

relatively greater when a slipstream is present, compared with the unpowered

wing. </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#10:1> <it> Leading-edge ice accretion causes similar large losses in

lift and increases of form drag although a comparison of the two types of

contamination showed that leading-edge ice produces a smaller reduction of

lift slope prior to flow separation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#11:1> In both types of contamination, Reynolds number is important, and

emphasizes the necessity of testing under near full-scale conditions. </it>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#14:1> Recent flying accidents resulting from adverse weather condi <l>

tions in the form of freezing rain or snow, have focused attention, on the

degradation of aerodynamic surfaces.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#15:1> One of the most recent accidents, involving a Fokker F-28, mk 1000

jet aircraft, and the subject of a Commission of Inquiry in Canada, dealt

specifically with the degradation of such surfaces due to ice and snow

contami <l> nants on the wings.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#16:1> The information contained in this paper stems in part from the

investigation conducted for the Commission of Inquiry into the Air Ontario

Crash at Dryden, Ontario, March 10, 1989.

<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#18:1> Investigations of the effects of uniform roughness on airfoils shows

clearly that stalling is premature, loss of maximum lift can range from 30 to

50%, ( depending on Reynolds number) and form drag reaches very high levels

at angles of attack below normal clean wing stall. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#19:1> The effect of upper surface roughness on complete aircraft

configurations is less well known; however, there is a long history of

aircraft accidents related to flight in icing conditions and several recent

accidents, including the Air Ontario F-28 accident, involving swept-wing jet

aircraft have highlighted the problem.

<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#21:1> Flow breakdown was accompanied not only by a <?> loss </?> of lift

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#23:1> Propeller-driven aircraft, where the slipstream passes over the

wing surface, are thought to be less sensitive to the effects of upper

surface contamination compared with the typical swept-wing con <l>

figuration.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#24:1> This is attributable in part to the effects of sweep that reduce the

wing lift-slope, compared with a straight wing; and the effects of slipstream

interaction that augment span loading locally, increase wing lift slope, and

also delay flow separation at high angles of attack.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#25:1> Thus the rotation angle on take off of a straight wing

propeller-driven aircraft is likely to be less than that for an equivalent

swept-wing aircraft with no slipstream interaction, and the likelihood of a

premature stall may not arise. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#26:1> Notwithstanding this apparent beneficial comparison, the

propeller-driven aircraft may still experience significant losses of lift and

large increases of drag if premature flow separation occurs when the wing

upper surface is contaminated.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#27:1> Figure 1b from Ref <l> erence 1 for the Fokker F-27 turboprop

transport wind tunnel model indicates, however, that smaller losses in

maximum lift may be expected from a contaminated wing, compared with the

airfoil test results of Figure 1a.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#28:1> The corresponding reduction in critical angle of attack is also small

and, in some cases, positive and was attributed to a significant change in

the wing-slipstream stall pat <l> tern.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#29:1> The extent to which the slipstream may remain attached to the wing

surface is unknown but its influence may affect the overall stall pattern

even when roughened by ice. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#30:1> In view of the unknown nature of the complex interactions of wing

boundary layer, propeller slipstream and distributed roughness, and the lack

of experimental data, it was decided to use the half-wing propeller model of

Reference 3 to obtain some preliminary data on the effects of upper surface

roughness in a slipstream and also the effects of typical in-flight ice

accretion shapes on the leading edge. <O> Picture </O> <O> Figure 2a caption

</O>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#31:1> The utility of the data to aircraft design or performance estimation

will be limited; the model configuration is not typical of current propeller

transport configurations and the test Reynolds number was low ( Re = 1.3

million). </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#32:1> <h> <bold> MODEL </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#33:1> The general arrangement of the rectangular, unswept half-wing

model is shown in Figure 2.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#34:1> The wing, having a NACA 4415 airfoil section, was untwisted and was

equipped with a 30 percent chord plain flap extending along the semi-span.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#35:1> The aspect ratio was 4.85.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#36:1> A nacelle containing a 20 hp water-cooled induction motor was

underslung on the wing approximately one chord length above the floor.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#37:1> The four-bladed propeller was located at 70% chord in front on the

leading edge and was equipped with an adjustable pitch-setting mechanism.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#38:1> The propeller/wing chord ratio was 1.33. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#39:1> <h> <bold> EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#40:1> The wing was pitched through an angle-of-attack range up to and

beyond stall.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#41:1> A complete stall and flow breakdown was not achieved with this model

due probably to the effects of the low <w> <?> a </?> spect </w> ratio,

Reynolds number and the half-model configuration. <O> Diagram </O> <O> Figure

2b caption </O> <
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#42:1> Maximum lift was achieved however, and this was used as a basis of

comparison for the effects of roughness.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#43:1> Model lift, drag and pitching moment were measured on the wind tunnel

balance.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#44:1> Pitch <l> ing moment was taken about the 30% chord location.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#45:1> The mea <l> sured forces include the propeller reaction, comprised of

thrust, normal force and pitching moment.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#46:1> The test Reynolds number was 1.3 million ( 2.3 million for the

unpowered wing only). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#47:1> At the desired test conditions, thrust coefficient C <sb> Tp

</sb> was varied by adjusting the blade pitch settings to a value of 0.115.

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#51:1> Roughness, in the form of a uniform distribution of carborun <l>

<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#52:1> Three grades of standard grit were used: 150 ( .0041", 80 ( .0083"),

46 ( .0165").
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#53:1> These correspond approximately to average roughness heights of .03", .06",

and .11" respectively on a full-scale wing of 10 <}> <-> ft. </-> <+> feet

</+> </}> chord giving roughness height/chord ratios of 0.000227, .000461 and .000916

respectively.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#54:1> In addition, a heavy grade ( 50 grit) of commercial sandpaper was

applied to the wing surface.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#55:1> The roughness height and concentration of this application was

considered to be significantly greater than the standard grit par <l> ticles

applied manually to the wing surface. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#56:1> The Carborundum grit was applied initially to the upper sur <l>

face from the lower leading edge stagnation region to the flap hinge line.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#57:1> Since only the forward portion of the chord was found to be sensitive

however, most of the investigation was performed with only the first 25-30%

of the chord roughened and the results pre <l> sented in this report are for

30% coverage. <O> Chart </O> <O> Figure 3a caption </O> <O> Chart </O> <O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#59:1> In addition to distributed roughness application, shapes rep <l>

resenting rime and glaze ice accretions were applied to the wing leading

<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#62:1> <h> <bold> Effects of Roughness — Powered Wing </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#63:1> With the application of power on the clean wing, the resulting

slipstream interaction produces an increase in both lift slope and maximum

lift by about 25%, and an increase of stalling angle of about 4 degrees.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#64:1> Roughly half of this lift increment comes from the propeller thrust

and normal force reactions; the other half is attributed to the interaction

of the slipstream with the wing ( Figure 3a). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#65:1> The wing drag polar, as seen in Figure 3b, is shifted by an

amount that corresponds to the thrust force plus a leading edge thrust on the

wing due to increased leading edge suction.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#66:1> The drag equivalent of the estimated propeller thrust has a value of

about 0.085, which, when subtracted from the total wing force at zero lift

apparently produces a negative drag or thrust on the wing.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#67:1> This effect, known as the ` Squire Effect', has been alluded to

before <fnr> <sp> 7 </sp> </fnr> and is attributed the effects of increased

pressure and flow rotation in the slipstream. <footnote> 7 Squire, H.B. and

Chester, W. - Calculation of the Effect of Slipstream on Lift and Drag. ARC

R&M 2368, 1950. </footnote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#68:1> With roughness applied to the wing upper surface there appears to

be a loss of lift slope and maximum lift of about 25 to 35% depending upon

roughness element size ( Figure 4a).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#69:1> In effect, the benefits of powered lift, resulting from slipstream

inter <l> action, is significantly reduced.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#70:1> Drag also increases as the flow sep <l> arates prematurely, and there

also is an increase in the parasite drag at zero lift due to roughness, and

increased dynamic pressure in the slipstream.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#71:1> The effect of roughness on wing pitching moment is small at angles of

attack below stall, ( &alpha; &lt; 10&degree;) but the moment becomes more

nose down as roughness size increases ( Figure 3c). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#72:1> The application of the heavy sandpaper roughness further

deteriorated the wing performance under power at the Reynolds number of 1.3

million.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#73:1> Maximum lift decreased slightly, as did the lift slope; although the

stall was not sharply defined.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#74:1> Drag also increased near zero lift but the pitching moment did not

change significantly, although the tendency continued to be nose-down. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#75:1> A comparison between the powered and unpowered wing drag polars

shows the relative effects of roughness with and without power ( Figure 6).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#76:1> It is clear from these graphs that roughness, espe <l> cially when it

reaches the heavy proportions of sandpaper coverage, has a much more adverse

effect on drag of the powered wing near maximum lift than for the unpowered

wing in uniform flow.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#77:1> At lift coefficients below stall however, drag increases between

powered and unpowered wings are similar.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#78:1> The lift curves exhibit about the same degree of degradation of

performance between powered and unpowered configurations .<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#> The pitching

moment change appears to be smaller when the wing is powered and is

accompanied by an increase in slope ( C <sb> m </sb> <}> <-> vs </-> <+>

versus to </+> </}> alpha) and a small change in the nose-up direction (

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#79:1> In order to simulate the scrubbing action of the slipstream, a

portion of the roughness was removed at the propeller location.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#80:1> This resulted in a modest improvement of performance ( Figure 5a).

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#82:1> In order to separate the propeller reactions from the total wing

forces, and to compare unpowered wing characteristics with those with the

wing immersed in the slipstream, the isolated propeller thrust, normal force

and pitching moment were estimated from Reference 5 and were removed from the

measured wing force and moment data.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#83:1> No attempt was made to correct the propeller data for the blockage

and upwash events of the wing; however the com <l> ments of Reference 8 and

the experimental data of Reference 4 suggest that these interactions may be

small.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#84:1> See Figure A. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-034#85:1> Typical wing characteristics with the propeller reactions removed

are shown in Figure 6.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#86:1> The increase in C <sb> Lmax </sb> for the clean wing ( Figure 6a) is

roughly half the total powered lift incre <l> ments.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#87:1> The loss of lift due to roughness increases with roughness scale and

is apparently greater for the unpowered wing than for the powered wing.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-034#88:1> Lift slope diminishes with roughness size in both cases. </p> </I>
