   Congratulations on being made Acting Head of English ( whether you  like it or not!)    ended before your return,  because I would liked to discuss the future of the  Unit  with you.  Ian  Johnson  about it.  's contract should be  renewed for another year.   manuscript  to Oxford at the end of  December, but obviously there will be proof reading, consultations with the  copy editor and other  - related matters to oversee after  that.  Further, the Unit is involved in several other projects that need  someone on the spot.    at length about how the Unit might  operate after the  is out.  I expect he will be in touch with you about it.    prize jury meeting on  September 9-10 and might manage a flying visit to meet with  .  I could also see you then, if it works out.  if you use e-mail - -          Unit's Advisory Committee meeting will be  held on Friday May 8th at 9:30.  Enclosed is the agenda for the morning meeting, which will be chaired  by  .  I also enclose the minutes from last year's meeting; any changes or  additions to these can be considered at this year's meeting.  After lunch, we will meet again to discuss entries, publication plans  and so forth more informally.  This meeting will finish at five.  At this point, your commitment to the Unit will be over, if you wish  to leave town!  However, I hope that all of us can dine together Friday night.  Rooms have been booked for you for Thursday, Friday and Saturday  nights at the  Inn.  Please let us know if you do not require the room for all of these  nights.    I enclose a batch of entries for your perusal.  Just write any rude remarks on the entries and mail them back (  include a receipt for the postage or bring it to the meeting and we will add  it to your expenses for reimbursement).  If you like, you can bring them with you to the meeting.  A second batch which I hope to send soon will contain a larger  proportion of " grammatical" and long entries.  Note the style guide; occasionally the entry may not conform to this  style, but we do plan to make it conform eventually.  Please comment on whatever strikes you, including the style guide  itself, the number and suitability of the quotations, the tone, you be the  judge.  Suggestions for new entries are always welcome.  Every time I look at an entry, I see mistakes and want to rewrite the  whole thing.    You will notice that we have not followed the Advisory  Committee's suggestion that the book might be sectioned into Grammar,  Lexicon,  .  's   is so structured, and this structure is logical and leads to  definite economies of space.  Several arguments pushed us to the decision to go, generally, for  small entries rather than large, and to an alphabetic format rather than a  sectioned one.  are structured alphabetically  2. Readership: many readers would not be able to decide quickly which  section the problem they were tackling would be solved in  , by their very nature, are not  comprehensive, even or rational in their coverage.  In usage, as in other fashions, there is a substratum of old  favourites and a thick layer of shifting trends.  If we try to organize it logically we will simply make the inevitable  contradictions obvious to the user/reviewer.  I do plan to deal with this in the introduction.  4. Ease of production: given the way the Unit operates, it is easier  to do short entries and later consider how they might be linked, either by a  general entry or by cross references or both, than to try to plan out the  larger entries in advance  et  cetera  .  that is  organized by short entries rather than long articles.   6. Reader / Browser appeal: we all agreed that it seems far less  daunting to see a series of little entries and that readers would be far more   to read a guide in bits than a  guide with headings like Grammar ( try to think back to a time when such a  heading filled you with  , if there ever was one!)     I hope these arguments don't seem too self-serving or  materialistic, but a  is a curious amalgam of popular and  scholarly.  aimed at pleasing  scholars ( who presumably don't need one) that will repel precisely the group  which needs it, primarily university students.  We do hope to have an index that will allow people to follow a theme  through the guide.    I look forward to seeing you in May.  Could you please book your flight, if you have not already done so,  so as to get the excursion fare?  If you book train tickets more than five days in advance, you can  save 40% for some or all of the trip.         Jerry   got his package safely.  Here is a repeat performance.  got.  project.  I have edited everything, it has gone back to everyone; however, I  have heard back so far only from  .  wanted me to ask you some questions about flapping   paper, but I  will save it until I see you.    I also enclose a copy of the plan a possible method for us to  generate a word frequency list.  Do you have any suggestions?          It was great to hear your voice again!  I hope we'll be able to have lunch together soon.    Here's a sketchy description or the project.  We have a contract to deliver a machine-readable, tagged manuscript  to Oxford in September 1992.  , it will contain 2,500  entries and run to  500 pages.  It will be Canadian in 3 respects: our generalizations are based on a  large ( 8 million words) database of Canadian books, magazines, journals and  newspapers covering a range of subjects and aimed at a variety of audiences -  - specialist to popular.  We also have a full year of the Globe ( 1985) and access to an  on-line database.    We will give advice, but tempered by what we know about what  Canadians actually do.  Thus although we will tell readers the rule about the possessive  before the gerund, we will also tell them that it is a dying practice.    I would like to ask you to help on 4 issues - -    .  We do not include all Canadianisms since we are not a dictionary.  However, we do include Canadian words where there might be a usage  problem and where current American and British collegiate dictionaries are  unlikely to include the information.  I enclose a list of examples.  2. possibly write the entry on the comma ( ? ! )  My view here is that since punctuation is so conventional, logic and  consistency should dictate as much as practice.  We would, or course, try to discover what practice is - - however  it's not all that easy to search grammatical constructions on our database.  3. Once I've extracted all the format/style information I can from  Oxford, to comment briefly on same.  4. copyedit - - my idea is that we would send you large batches of  hard copy starting in March 1992 ( with perhaps a preliminary run, just to  see what's happening).  I'm trying to keep things consistent here but it's complex with 4  people writing entries.  If you think editing tagged machine-readable copy would be easier,  let me know, but I think at the finai stage hard copy is best.     etc.  before May and then maybe we can firm  things up when we lunch.          didn't overlap.  How does it feel to take on such an awesome responsibility?  about the Unit,  but it was not to be.  's appointment  should be renewed for a year, he sensibly refuses to get involved in the  future of the  Unit at this point in his Headship.  So I think that your opinion is required about discussions I am  having with Oxford, since the Department is a signatory to the contract for  the usage guide.    Canada  on my way here and talked to the new Managing Director,   , and  Canadian  Timbuktoo Dictionary  , and we agreed to  change the contract in two ways.  We agreed on a new deadline ( necessary because the first one was a  sheer guess and my recent past has prevented me from doing much work on  entries) and decided that  's involvement in the intellectual  labour of the project should be recognized.  , you will see  that I raised a few other issues with her after discussing the contract with     The issue that directly concerns you is the way the royalties  are apportioned.  I don't want to go into a blow-by-blow account of the discussions  between  and me over this, but it is the one occasion I can  remember where we disagreed seriously.  Unit budget was  extremely healthy, but when I suggested that the royalties be split between  me and the Unit he argued firmly that these should go to the Department  instead.  One of his points was that this is the arrangement that the  Department has with  .   Essay Skills  - - I think this weakens the analogy.  has benefitted from the  work of members of the Department - - the Head, for example, has to spend  quite a lot of unrewarded time on  matters.  His main point was that the Department suffered from the loss of the  Director's teaching time.  Unit  pays the Department for release time, nor that I did  my  share of committee work and taught one course a year for five years, even  though if the one-third rule had been applied to the 2.5 load, I would have  been given a half course off every three years.  I am pointing all this out in hopes that you will see at once that  the Department should consent to giving up a small portion of its royalties,  as will I, so that  's contribution can be recognized.  She has definitely crossed the line from employee to colleague as  far as I'm concerned, and I think this has to be recognized in the usual  ways.    We worked out the proportions at the end of the contract with  the main 12 and 1/2  royalty in mind:  thus, roughly, 5      .  really doesn't care how we divvy up the  royalties, so if you have a different suggestion, we could certainly discuss  it.
