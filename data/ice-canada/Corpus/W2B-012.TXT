<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#4:1> Anchored amid the swirling mists and breakers off northwestern

Vancouver Island is a place so small and seemingly incon <l> sequential it

remains virtually unknown.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#5:1> But to more than one million seabirds, Triangle Island is British

Columbia's greatest nesting colony.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#6:1> In a province with 27,300 kilometres of rugged and largely unpopulated

coastline, this remote island is the nesting place of one-fifth of B.C.'s

breeding seabirds.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#7:1> Its numbers nearly equal those of the Queen Charlotte Islands

combined. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#8:1> Located 45 kilometres northwest of Cape Scott, at the outermost of

the Scott Islands group, 85-hectare Triangle Island is on the marine highway

to nowhere.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#9:1> The island served as a lighthouse station from 1910 to 1919.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#10:1> However, that function was all but useless, even though the

lighthouse was, at 210 metres, the highest one on the coast.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#11:1> In 1912 a hurricane blew the well-secured tower over a cliff.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#12:1> Soon rebuilt, it was doomed to close because heavy fogs frequently

obscured its light.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#13:1> Today only mice, voles, and rabbits permanently inhabit this

forbidding island.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#14:1> Human visitors, thankfully, are as infrequent as sunshine.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#15:1> They are occasional fishermen seeking safe haven in Pacific storms,

and researchers pondering the propagation of seabirds. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#16:1> Each year, however, between April and September, a hail of birds

arrives from the surrounding North Pacific.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#17:1> They squawk and <unclear> unclear word </unclear> in a frenzy to

select nesting sites, defend them from predators, and raise their chicks.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#18:1> Species include Cassin's and rhinoceros auklets, tufted puffins,

common murres, glaucous-winged gulls, pigeon guillemots, pelagic cormorants,

black oyster catchers, bald eagles, and peregrine falcons. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#19:1> About one million Cassin's auklets - more than 40 percent of

their world population - are the first to arrive.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#20:1> They burrow under the tufted hair grass and salmonberry bushes that

carpet the green and brown landscape.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#21:1> Like some 84,000 of their rhino cousins, the stubby Cassin's auklets

commute each day from ocean feeding waters to hungry chicks waiting in

burrows.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#22:1> They return under the protection of darkness, their unmistakable

silhouettes drawn in thick fluttering waves to the steep 210-metre-high

hillsides. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#23:1> <quote> " It's amazing," </quote> remarks Ken Summers, 42, of

Aldergrove, who has conducted research at Triangle Island for four years. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#X24:1> <quote> " They come in at night and know exactly where to go. When

they leave in the morning, you just hear the wind whistling through their

wings." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#25:1> Cassin's auklets are the most prolific breeders among B.C.'s 15

seabird species, with as many as 400 separate burrows in a single

10-metre-square space on Triangle Island. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#26:1> Some 52,000 tufted puffins, the largest colony on the Pacific

coast south of Alaska, are active, even brazen, around their burrows during

the day.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#27:1> On congested breeding sites such as Puffin Rock, they circle, holding

silvery sand lance crossways in their beaks, orange feet trailing awkwardly,

and distinctive locks of pale yellow hair flowing. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#28:1> Crowded together on exposed rocks and cliff ledges, an estimated

10,000 common murres stand penguinlike over their young.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#29:1> They lean into the rock, shrieking madly, guarding against airborn

predators like gulls, crows, eagles, and falcons.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#30:1> Murres are well-adapted, perhaps too well, to cliff nesting.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#31:1> Birds that fail to breed continue with their normal nesting behavior

as though nothing had happened. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#32:1> <quote> " They'll bring in fish and lay them down, or go through

all the motions of nesting, even rolling the egg over, with nothing beneath

them," </quote> says Summers.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#33:1> Protected from hunters on the west coast, murres remain traditional

game birds under Newfoundland's terms of Confederation in 1949, explains

Steve Wetmore, B.C.'s chief of migratory birds for the Canadian Wildlife

Service. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#X34:1> <quote> " They're shot by the boatload on the east coast.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#X35:1> They taste kind of oily, greasy, and fishy. Kind of yucky." </quote>

</X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#36:1> Elsewhere on Triangle Island, wide-eyed gull chicks huddle on the

uppermost ledges, sizing up the lethal surf below, preparing for a first

flight.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#37:1> On nearby rocks, cormorants stand with waterlogged wings

outstretched, as if in worship to the setting sun.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#38:1> And, with Triangle Island being one of four breeding rookeries in

B.C., up to 800 Steller's sea lions writhe about in harems, protecting their

wrinkled pups with an incessant chorus of barks and belches. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#39:1> That this treeless, windblown refuge has continued to thrive

while some other key seabird sites in B.C. have declined is due as much to

its geographic isolation as its prime breeding habitat and abundant marine

life.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#40:1> To date it has avoided the disruption facing nesting sites in the

newly created South Moresby National Park Reserve, namely from introduced

rats and raccoons, recreational boaters, and uneducated nature lovers. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#41:1> Triangle Island also receives some provincial protection as the

Anne Vallee Ecological Reserve, named after a University of British Columbia

master's student from Qu&eacute;bec who fell to her death in 1982.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#42:1> The province issues visitor permits only for scientific and

educational purposes, although lack of enforcement staff and penalties makes

conformance largely voluntary. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#43:1> The ineffectiveness of current regulations protecting B.C.

nesting sites was shown during an 875,000-litre spill of bunker C fuel oil in

December, 1988, from the <it> Nestucca </it> barge off Grays Harbor, Wash.

<O> photograph </O> <O> Named for its geometric shape, Triangle Island is the

outermost of the Scott Islands group off northwestern Vancouver Island. </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#44:1> Oil from the barge drifted northward into Canadian waters against the

prediction of the U.S. Coast Guard, fouling Vancouver Island's west coast and

closing commercial shellfish harvesting.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#45:1> At least 12,500 seabirds - more than three-quarters of them common

murres - were found dead in B.C. and Washington, although the actual kill may

be closer to 50,000 birds. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#46:1> Isolated, fist-sized blobs of oil floated with the prevailing

currents as far as Triangle Island, more than 500 kilometres north of the

spill site.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#47:1> The experience made a mockery of a federal 10-kilometre exclusion

zone around seabird colonies and other land sites in the event offshore oil

drilling proceeds on the west coast.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#48:1> A final decision on drilling awaits a five-year moratorium imposed by

the B.C. government in March, 1989, shortly after the <it> Nestucca </it>

spill. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#49:1> Concerned about the spill's impact on Triangle Island, the

Canadian Wildlife Service hired Summers and fellow researcher Michael Rodway,

38, of Ladner, to conduct a &dollar;72,000 census of the nesting seabirds

last summer. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#50:1> Dividing the island into sample plots, they scour its surface on

hands and knees, checking for egg shells, feces, and feathers that mark an

active burrow. <O> photograph </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#51:1> Sometimes they ferret out chicks to determine breeding success.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#52:1> They also photograph rock cliffs from a five-metre-long inflatable

craft, using a telephoto lens, <unclear> unclear word </unclear> counting the

adult birds by putting the photos under a binocular microscope. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#53:1> <quote> " This is the main site for murres right here," </quote>

says Rodway, staggering to focus his lens and pointing to the waterfall of

guano pouring off a crowded ledge.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#54:1> As Summers works the outboard motor against the rising ocean swells,

Rodway watches the young murres and adds: <quote> " At 20 days, they jump off

the cliff.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#55:1> The males lead them out, and the females, needing to build up their

reserves, stay for a couple of extra days." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#56:1> The luxury of studying such abundant wildlife has its own

problems.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#57:1> For example, getting the information without disrupting your subjects

can be nerve-wracking.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#58:1> The island is like a mine field.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#59:1> A heavy foot can easily collapse shallow burrows, squishing the chick

or exposing it to predators.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#60:1> Researchers made amends by carrying around tiny wooden shingles for

quick repairs.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#61:1> Even approaching too close while photographing the cliffs can spook

entire colonies of murres: they tend to exit en masse, like crowds after a

concert, and leave their young undefended. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#62:1> While the federal study shows total populations are healthy on

Triangle Island, the virtual breeding failure of some 2,000 <?> murres </?>

on nearby Castle Rock is possibly linked to the oil spill. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#63:1> Despite the ever-present threat of oil spills and the

undetermined impact of both high seas and inshore gill-net fishing, the <w>

seabirds' </w> future on Triangle Island looks stable, provided humans keep

away </p> .

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#64:1> Bird research on the island is still in its infancy.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#65:1> Experience at other irreplaceable wildlife sites, most notably the

killer whales rubbing beaches at Robson Bight on northern Vancouver Island,

show even small-scale public viewing has a negative impact. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#66:1> In the meantime, the public must be content with seabirds serving

a more practical purpose - providing an early-warning system to environmental

problems that could affect man. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#67:1> <quote> " Often they are the first indication of something going

wrong with the food chain," </quote> notes Steve Wetmore, holding a gull

chick which will probably spend the winter at a garbage dump rather than at

the remote landscape where it was born. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#68:2> <h> <bold> Osoyoos </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#69:2> Photography by Karl Spreitz

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#70:2> The town of Osoyoos bears a revolutionary message for all British

Columbia communities, especially those which are always trying to attract a

big-industry panacea, like a pulp mill.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#71:2> The message comes in a promotional videotape the Okanagan Valley town

has produced after it had learned its own hard historical lessons. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#72:2> The tape opens with a re-creation of gold rushers coming into the

area during the last century, all looking for that elusive pot of gold in

creek beds.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#73:2> They don't find it.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#74:2> Then they wake up to the realization that the real gold is all around

them.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#75:2> It's the environment.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#76:2> It's the beauty of the land.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#77:2> It's the fresh air.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#78:2> It's the fresh water.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#79:2> It's the warm climate.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#80:2> They stay and become settlers. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#81:2> Recent generations in Osoyoos have had to relearn this lesson.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#82:2> They had <?> fallen </?> prey to the same illusion, but in other

form.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#83:2> We must, they had said to themselves, attract the pot of gold to us.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#84:2> We must seek industrial development.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#85:2> Meanwhile, they began to worry about their environment.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#86:2> They feared raw effluent would begin to make its way into Lake

Osoyoos, a gem of a lake - warm, beautiful, filled with fish. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#87:2> Town administrator Lockie Miles chuckles philosophically over

what Osoyoos used to do, vainly, to attract industry. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#X88:2> <quote> " Like many other B.C. communities, for instance, we got a

grant in 1981 under the B.C. Development Plan to build an industrial park.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#X89:2> Initially we had about 10 hot prospects.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#X90:2> Today the park sits fairly empty.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#X91:2> And we paved it, electrified it, and put in sewage lines, and all

the services." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#92:2> The seeds of Osoyoos's latter-day awakening go back to 1964.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#93:2> By a 10-vote margin, residents opted for sewage lagoons on the West

Bench, a move that prevented the possibility of septic fields ever polluting

Lake Osoyoos.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#94:2> Then, in 1980, town council had a stroke of genius that made Osoyoos

a leader to be imitated.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#95:2> It put the treated effluent to work.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#96:2> The purified water, " almost drinkable", now sprinkles a soccer

field, the desert Park Racetrack, and the 18-hole Osoyoos Golf and Country

Club. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#97:2> <quote> " We are now a concerned environmental community,"

</quote> , says Miles. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#X98:2> <quote> " We like to think we are the most environmentally concerned

community in B.C." </quote> </X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#99:2> He even gets the impression that the attitude of Osoyoos has changed

so much that if a pulp mill wanted to locate here the town would say no. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#100:2> This evolution in thinking is paying off, and in unexpected

ways.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#101:2> Tourism has been a mainstay, with some fluctuations, since the

mid-1940s, but this past year was sensational.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#102:2> Over and above this, Osoyoos has recently become a retire <l> ment

centre.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#103:2> One-third of the town's citizens are retired, many of them only in

their 50s.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#104:2> As word spreads, it's likely more will select Osoyoos as the place

to buy their last home. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#105:2> Osoyoos's setting is indeed idyllic, and it boasts some unusual

features.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#106:2> Even its name is intriguing.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#107:2> It derives from the Okanagan Indian word <mention> Sooyoos

</mention> , meaning " the narrows" or " the place where two lakes come

together."
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#108:2> No one is sure how the name changed by the time Osoyoos become a

Hudson's Bay trading post in 1860, but some say that Peter O'Reilly, a

magistrate from Hope, jokingly suggested that adding an O would dignify it

</p> .

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#109:2> Downtown Osoyoos sits at the junction of two major roads.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#110:2> Highway 97 runs north up the Okanagan Valley to Pen <l> ticton,

Kelowna and Vernon, and south across the B.C. - Washington border, Highway 3,

the Crowsnest, runs west to Hope, and east over a bridge across the lake

toward the Rockies.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#111:2> It's here, at this bridge, where Osoyoos Lake narrows to become

almost two lakes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#112:2> You can best appreciate the overall landscape by driving up the

corkscrewing turns of Highway 3 to the summit of Anarchist Mountain, 1,499

metres.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#113:2> Osoyoos Lake appears as an oasis amidst the driest land in Canada.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#114:2> Its shimmering blue waters stretch along the southern end of B.C.'s

Okanagan Valley, where the Monashee Mountains roll down from the east and

meld with the Thompson Plateau.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#115:2> Lush green fruit trees embellish the shores, a stark contrast to the

parched brown hills on the upper slopes, out of reach of irrigation lines

that nourish the lakeside orchards. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-012#116:2> In the distant south, beyond the international boundary that

bisects this 15-kilometre-long lake, the tiny town of Oroville, Washington,

sits at the outlet of the lake.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-012#117:2> Directly below Anarchist Mountain, the homes and shops of Osoyoos,

population 2,956, cluster around the lake. </p> </I>
