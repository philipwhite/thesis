<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#1:1> <h> Report says Great Lakes danger to human health </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#2:1> Canadian and U.S. governments have failed to protect human health

because they haven't cleaned up toxins in the Great Lakes, the International

Joint Commission says in a report released Tuesday. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#3:1> Governments must ban dumping of any toxic chemicals into lakes and

rivers to prevent serious disease and birth defects in humans, the commission

says in its most strongly-worded report ever. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#4:1> <quote> " The commission must conclude that there is a threat to

the health of our children emanating from our exposure to persistent toxic

substances." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#5:1> The Great Lakes basin is home to 40 million people.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#6:1> The commission is a Canada-U.S. body that advises the two governments

on managing the shared waters. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#7:1> Children of mothers who regularly ate Lake Michigan fish tended to

be smaller at birth, had smaller skulls and were slow learners, the report

says. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#8:1> There is <quote> " ample reason to strongly suspect exposure to

chemicals, particularly PCBs ( polychlorinated biphenyls), was damaging to

the offspring of those mothers," </quote> it concludes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#9:1> It says the presence of cancer, weak immune systems, birth defects

and sterility in lake fish, birds and mammals raise <quote> " two fundamental

and sobering questions: Are humans in danger?
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#10:1> Are future generations in danger?" </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#11:1> The report urges more research on health hazards other than

cancer, such as damage to hormones, the brain and immune systems. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#12:1> The 59-page report hammers the federal government for inaction

and the sluggish pace of plans intended to clean up toxic " hot spots" on the

lakes and the St. Lawrence River.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#13:1> Seventeen of the 42 hot spots are in Canada. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#14:1> The cleanup plans are bogged down in bureaucracy and haven't made

real advances in the four years since they began, the IJC says. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#15:1> One stumbling block has been delays by bureaucrats who can't

agree on what the problems are in the first place, the report says.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#16:1> It adds tersely that cleanup plans <quote> " are not merely a

planning exercise." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#17:1> It urges governments in Canada and the U.S. to <quote> " accept,

and encourage others to accept, their responsibility" </quote> to the lakes.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#18:1> <quote> " There is no clear indication they ( governments)

consistently and comprehensively support the intention of the ( Great Lakes

Water Quality) Agreement with specific actions and adequate resources."

</quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#19:1> It says governments should start by banning all toxic discharges

into Lake Superior as a pilot project, since Superior is the cleanest lake

and is at the top of the lake system. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#20:1> Stocking fish in the lakes when many are unfit to eat is <quote> "

an exercise in contraction," </quote> the report says.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#21:1> It urges governments to issue stronger public warnings against eating

certain types of fish that contain toxic chemicals. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#22:1> " They ( the commission) basically say the federal governments on

both sides have done nothing about anything," said Gord Perks of Greenpeace.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#23:1> " If I were ( Environment Minister) Lucien Bouchard I would be very

angry." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#24:1> He said the document is <quote> " a challenge to Lucien Bouchard,

( Ontario <}> <-> Environvironment </-> <+> Environment </+> </}> Minister)

Jim Bradley and American legislators to clean up the lakes." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#25:1> " It's probably the first time I would strongly congratulate the

IJC," said John Jackson, president of Great Lakes United, a coalition of 200

<w> citizens' </w> groups around the lakes. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#26:2> <h> Commons passes GST; Two Tory MPs face expulsion for voting

against unpopular tax </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#27:2> The goods and services tax legislation was approved Tuesday. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#28:2> Two shouting protesters were ejected from the nearly empty

galleries for throwing anti-GST streamers, but the vote was subdued compared

to the finance committee filibuster and other marathon sessions over the tax.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#29:2> Despite public and opposition pressure on government MPs to

reject the hugely unpopular measure, the bill passed 144 - 114. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#30:2> Only two Tory backbenchers voted against it.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#31:2> Alex Kindy and David Kilgour, both from Alberta, were expected to be

expelled today from the national party caucus. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#32:2> Neither was present at today's meeting.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#33:2> " Why would I go to my own lynching?" Kilgour said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#34:2> A senior Alberta Tory, Arnold Malone, was expected to push for

the <w> MPs' </w> expulsion. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#35:2> " If you're wearing our sweater and you shoot the puck into our

own goal, you've got to question whether you should be sitting on our own

bench anymore." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#36:2> Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said on the way into the meeting

that he would listen to his Alberta members before making up his own mind on

whether Kindy and Kilgour should be expelled. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#37:2> The GST bill now goes to the Senate where the Liberals, who hold

a majority in the upper chamber, have vowed to keep it for up to six months

while cross-country hearings are held. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#38:2> The seven-per-cent tax on virtually all goods and services is due

to take effect Jan. 1, 1991.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#39:2> It replaces the hidden 13.5-per-cent <w> manufacturers' </w> sales

tax on Canadian manufactured goods. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#40:2> Government House Leader Harvie Andre admitted the Senate has the

legal power to block or defeat the bill. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#41:2> But if " we get to a situation where we consider it reasonable

for an unelected body ... to veto a democratically elected House of Commons,

then I think we are into a dangerous, dangerous situation." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#42:2> Neither Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, whose government is at a

record low 15 per cent in the polls, nor Finance Minister Michael Wilson was

present for the vote. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#43:2> Mulroney was meeting U.S. President George Bush in Toronto and

Wilson was in Europe for a meeting of the leading western economies. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#44:2> In all, seven Conservative cabinet ministers and 10 backbenchers

were absent for the 15-minute vote.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#45:2> But of those missing, only Quebec MP Fernand Jourdenais and Alberta

MP Louise Feltham had indicated they were unhappy with the GST. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#46:2> Eleven Liberals and three New Democrats were also absent. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#47:2> Government whip Jim Hawkes had made it clear Conservatives would

need a good excuse to be absent for what the government classed a confidence

vote. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#48:2> Governments traditionally resign if defeated on a vote of

confidence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#49:2> The failure of the much-rumored revolt of Tory backbenchers was

described as a tragedy by Kilgour. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#50:2> He called MPs who followed the party line despite their

misgivings <quote> " robots" </quote> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#51:2> " If there is no room for dissent in the party ... it will be a

tragedy for the party and for the country." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#52:2> Asked about the fate of the two rebels, House Leader Andre said

he would be <quote> " very surprised if there is any significant move in

caucus for them to stay there ...
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#53:2> They made their decision." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#54:2> Opposition MPs were dejected as they left the Commons chamber.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#55:2> " The war may not totally be lost but this was a big battle,"

said Liberal finance critic Doug Young. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#56:2> " We tried everything we could possibly do, there was nothing

else," said NDP finance critic Lorne Nystrom. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#57:2> " Now I encourage the Senate to do some foot dragging ... and

send back several recommended changes to the Commons next fall, and we will

give it one more kick at the can." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#58:2> NDP Leader Audrey McLaughlin was still in a fighting mood. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#59:2> " I still believe that public opinion can turn this thing around ...

We've got to keep up the fight." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#60:2> Of the two area Conservative MPs, only Paul Dick,

Lanark-Carleton, voted for the legislation.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#61:2> Barry Moore, Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, was absent. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#62:2> All 12 area Liberals voted against the bill.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#63:2> They were Mark Assad, Gatineau-La Lievre; Eugene Bellemare, Carleton

Gloucester; Don Boudria, Glengarry-Prescott-Russell; Marlene Catterall,

Ottawa West; Beryl Gaffney, Nepean; Jean-Robert Gauthier, Ottawa-Vanier; Mac

Harb, Ottawa Centre; Len Hopkins, Renfrew; Jim Jordan, Leeds-Grenville; Bob

Kilger, Stormont-Dundas; John Manley, Ottawa South; and Gilles Rocheleau,

Hull-Aylmer. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#64:3> <h> OBE strike wouldn't close schools </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#65:3> Ottawa Board of Education officials will keep all 51 elementary

schools open, if its 1,300 elementary teachers vote on Thursday to strike.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#66:3> There will be no instruction and it will be up to parents to

decide whether to send their children, OBE spokesman Steve Moretti said

today.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#67:3> They will be supervised by principals, vice-principals and <w>

teachers' </w> aides. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#68:3> Schools vary in size from Alta Vista Public School with 742

students to Whitehaven Public School with 110. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#69:3> Principals will send notes home with students Thursday outlining

the OBE's contingency plan if there is a strike. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#70:3> " At this point, there is no strike called and we're still hoping

we'll be able to resolve the issues without one," Moretti said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#71:3> The earliest a strike could be called is April 18, the day after

teachers and 17,000 elementary students return from the four-day Easter

break. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#72:3> Teachers will vote Thursday on the OBE's final wage offer of a

five-per-cent increase.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#73:3> Teachers are asking for 8.8 per cent.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#74:3> They have been without contracts since August 31, 1989.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#75:3> The top salary for an OBE elementary teacher is &dollar;52,425. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#76:3> Ontario Public School <w> Teachers' </w> Federation president

Bill Martin said the negotiating committee will recommend teachers turn down

the OBE offer.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#77:3> The OBE has asked teachers to agree to binding arbitration. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#78:3> Moretti said busing, day care and after-four programs will

continue. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#79:3> Under provincial law, principals and vice-principals are obliged

to stay at their schools although they are members of the federations

bargaining with the board.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#80:3> About 260 <w> teachers' </w> aides and assistants are also expected

to be at the schools. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#81:3> Moretti said as far as he was aware it would be the first time

the elementary schools would be closed by a strike. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#82:4> <h> Mulroney raps 'no class' fans; Skydome's loudest jeers prompted

by French stanza of ' 0 Canada' </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#83:4> After his warmup toss Tuesday at the Skydome, Prime Minister

Brian Mulroney blazed a few high hard ones today at <quote> " no class"

</quote> Toronto baseball fans and a gadfly Liberal MP from Newfoundland.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#84:4> The prime minister was loudly booed Tuesday night when he

appeared with U.S. President George Bush to throw out the ceremonial first

pitches at the Toronto Blue <w> Jays' </w> home opener Tuesday night with the

Texas Rangers. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#85:4> " All it showed was a handful of people in the Skydome had no

class at all in an otherwise world-class city," Mulroney told reporters as he

arrived for the weekly Conservative caucus meeting. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#86:4> " A handful of people conducted themselves with their usual bad

taste but they are in no way representative of Toronto or Ontario at all."

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#87:4> Mulroney also tore a strip of Newfoundland Liberal MP Brian Tobin

who Tuesday accused Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard of " cowardice" over

the latter's suggestion that the Meech Lake impasse may force English Canada

to choose between Quebec and Newfoundland. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#88:4> " It was a thoroughly disgraceful statement for Mr. Tobin to

make, to accuse a member of Parliament of cowardly misconduct," an angry

Mulroney said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#89:4> Tobin accused Bouchard of lacking <quote> " a backbone" </quote>

and being <quote> " a coward" </quote> after he allowed Mulroney and Deputy

Prime Minister Don Mazankowski to defend him in the House.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#90:4> Mulroney said his Quebec lieutenant had been quoted out of context

and that he had gone on to say <quote> " nobody thinks Newfoundland should

leave Confederation." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#91:4> But Tuesday, egged on by Tobin, an irate Bouchard then refused to

withdraw his statement, undermining Mulroney's defence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#92:4> The booing erupted as Mulroney and Bush, flanked by baseball

commissioner Fay Vincent and American League president Bobby Brown, walked on

the field.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#93:4> The leaders endured anti-goods and services tax chants from the

sellout crowd of 49,673. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#94:4> The loudest boos weren't directed at Mulroney, however, but

rather Toronto rock group Blue Rodeo during a stanza of the Canadian national

anthem in French. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#95:4> At their meeting in the SkyDome earlier, the two leaders

concentrated on international issues, leaving little time for bilateral

relations. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#96:4> But Mulroney did say he hoped the U.S. Clean Air Act will be

passed by Congress in time for negotiations on a bilateral acid rain accord

to begin this summer. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#97:4> Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that the United

States is prepared to open talks this summer.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-014#98:4> He added, however, that Bush will have to be sure that the House

version of the clean air bill is one he can sign. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#99:4> Both leaders supported an expanded free-trade arrangement that

would include Mexico, a deal they believe can help Mexico turn around its

economic problems. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#100:4> And they were in agreement on NATO and European matters,

emphasizing support for involvement in NATO by a united Germany. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#101:4> They also concurred that Mikhail Gorbachev represented the best

hope for change in the Soviet Union. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-014#102:4> Bush refused to discuss the impact of rising Quebec separatist

sentiment on the stability of future Canada-U.S. relations. </p> </I>
