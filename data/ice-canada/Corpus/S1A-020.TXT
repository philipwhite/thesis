The Simpsons
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#183:1:A> Like not Matt Groening but <,> two of the other guys who produce

it

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#184:1:B> Ya

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#185:1:A> Ya

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#186:1:B> He doesn't do much though does he Matt Groening <,,>

<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#192:1:A> Well no <}> <-> on the </-> <=> on the </=> </}> Halloween

specials I think he was listed as a producer

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#193:1:B> <{> <[> Mhhm </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#194:1:A> <[> Maybe </[> </{> not I don't know

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#195:1:B> See that's <}> <-> how </-> <=> what </=> </}> I don't

understand about this showbiz stuff
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#196:1:B> You get like okay produced by <{1> <[1> <,> so </[1> and so

directed by
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#197:1:B> <{2> <[2> <,> such </[2> and such a blah blah blah film written by

duh
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#198:1:B> <{3> <[3> duh duh </[3> you know like
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#199:1:B> <{4> <[4> who's </[4> the big boss here

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#200:1:A> <[1> Mhhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#201:1:A> <[2> <O> laugh </O> </[2> </{2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#202:1:A> <[3> <O> laugh </O> </[3> </{3>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#203:1:A> <[4> mhhm </[4> </{4>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#204:1:A> <O> laugh </O> That's a tough <{> <[> call </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#205:1:B> <[> See <}> <-> what </[> </{> what </-> <=> a producer does

what </=> </}> <,,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#206:1:A> Director generally <,> creates the vision <,> and says this

is what I want to see
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#207:1:A> Producer <,,> generally <,> actually makes it come into being
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#208:1:A> They're both on the set
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#209:1:A> Often the director will order actors and say uh <,> I want you to

do this I want to show this kind of emotion I want this set to look dark like

this I want the lighting to be like this
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#210:1:A> The producer actually gets the lighting guy and says okay these

are the kinds of levels we need set them up uhm I'll order some more lights

for you I'll get this <{> <[> <,,> </[> so

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#211:1:B> <[> Mhhm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#212:1:A> I think the director is more visionary translates the

writer's vision and the producer tends to <,,> help enact it

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#213:1:B> So when they say <}> <-> it's a such and <}> <-> <.> s </.>

</-> <+> such </+> </}> </-> <=> it's a so and so </=> </}> film <,> so what

does that mean
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#214:1:B> That guy like <{> <[> provides the cash </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#215:1:A> <[> <O> Puff </O> Owns the company </[> </{> <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#216:1:A> He brings the doughnuts everyday
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#217:1:A> That's the most important part <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#218:1:A> I don't know
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#219:1:A> But I think that's like uh whoever owns the company
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#220:1:A> Like The Simpsons and so on was done by a group called Klasky

Csupo
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#221:1:A> <O> laugh </O> I know what what a weird name <{> <[> <O> laugh

</O> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#222:1:B> <[> Was there </[> </{> a dog at the end

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#223:1:A> Eh

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#224:1:B> Was it the dog at the end no <,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#225:1:A> No
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#226:1:A> Oh well the company <,> see it's a tough call
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#227:1:A> The animation's done by Klasky Csupo I think the filming or

something or the printing of the film is another company
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#228:1:A> Klasky Csupo got big
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#229:1:A> <}> <-> They're doing </-> <=> they do </=> </}> like The Simpsons

The Critic <,> they do <,> Rugrats <}> <-> they do <,> </-> <=> they do </=>

Fresh Prince or <,,> I don't know <}> <-> any of it </-> <=> almost any of

those shows </=> </}> Wings is one of the few that I kind of stand but <,>

almost any other it's like ya it's typical sitcom funny
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#234:1:A> Like you know they get in trouble <}> <-> they're <,> </-> <=>

they </=> </}> do stupid things <{> <[> they're <unclear> words </unclear>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-020#237:1:B> Well what's funny is that <}> <-> how </-> <=> how </=> </}>

<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#239:1:A> Well how do you mean
<ICE-CAN:S1A-020#240:1:A> Like the animated ones <,> <{> <[> versus the </[>

you have a sitcom you know when the sitcoms come out then like you know the
