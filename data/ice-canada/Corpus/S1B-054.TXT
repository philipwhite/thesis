<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-054#1:1:A> We're a country that basically wants Canadians to know that we

all have a responsibility for our country and consequently for our actions
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#2:1:A> However as the Minister of Justice uh made clear legislation is only

one part of the answer to violence among young people
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#3:1:A> Protecting the public is the primary and necessary objective but we

must focus our attention on helping our young people if we are to find

lasting and effective solutions to youth crime
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#4:1:A> I'm encouraged to see that the amendments to the Young Offenders Act

include provisions for the rehabilitation and treatment of young offenders in

the community
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#5:1:A> There are many complex questions surrounding <}> <-> yet </-> <=>

youth </=> </}> crime questions that the Standing Committee on <}> <-> <.>

Justi </.> </-> <=> Justice </=> </}> and Legal Affairs will be examining as

part of the reform of the youth justice system
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#6:1:A> <}> <-> I will </-> <=> I welcome </=> </}> the opportunity to work

with my colleagues in the House to take action <,> on the contributing

factors <}> <-> to </-> <=> to </=> </}> crime and violence such as

unemployment poverty alcoholism drug and substance abuse family violence

racism and illiteracy
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#7:1:A> This is not to say that any of those one factors <,> <}> <-> are

justify </-> <=> uh justify </=> </}> any kind of violent crimes or should

contribute to <,> uh saying that young people have the right to commit crimes
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#8:1:A> That really isn't
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#9:1:A> These are mitigating factors
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#10:1:A> These are things that <,> make it very difficult for young people

to have a life that's well a life that's healthy and a life that keeps them

from that side of uhm uhm the negative side of life so to speak
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#11:1:A> Socioeconomic misery and crime are two sides of the same coin
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#12:1:A> By addressing these problems in our society we will be tackling <,>

the root causes of youth crime and ultimately adult crime
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#13:1:A> It does not take any stretch of the imagination to see how such

socioeconomic misery fuels anger frustration anti-social behaviour and

criminal activity <}> <-> a young </-> <=> among young people </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#14:1:A> I would like the House to consider the adverse conditions <}> <->

of many of our <.> aborig </.> </-> <=> that many of our aboriginal youth

</=> </}> face as they walk through the perilous path to adulthood
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#15:1:A> Unemployment among aboriginal people is twice the Canadian level
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#16:1:A> It is the number one problem facing aboriginal communities and they

have the lowest incomes of anyone in the country
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#17:1:A> Illiteracy rate among aboriginal people is twice the national

average
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#18:1:A> High school dropout rates can be as high as ninety-five per cent in

isolated northern communities
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#19:1:A> Fifty-seven point seven per cent of aboriginal people are <}> <->

under the age years </-> <=> under the age <}> <-> of twenty </-> <=> of

twenty-four </=> </}> </=> </}> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#20:1:A> The aboriginal population is very young growing fast and on the

move
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#21:1:A> The majority of aboriginal peoples do not live on reserves and the

migration of on-reserve aboriginal peoples to urban centres particularly in

western Canada is increasing
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#22:1:A> In Manitoba it is estimated that one out of four new entrants into

the job market will be of aboriginal origin
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#23:1:A> In Saskatchewan it will be one out of three
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#24:1:A> Are they destined for a life of unemployment social problems crime
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#25:1:A> The odds seem stacked against them but this not need be the case
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#26:1:A> Five to six times the number of aboriginal peoples are incarcerated

in provincial and federal institutions as compared to aboriginal peoples in

the general population
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#27:1:A> Yet aboriginal peoples only represent approximately three point

seven per cent of the Canadian population
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#28:1:A> The state of many aboriginal peoples in Canada is not a pretty

picture
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#29:1:A> Despite these socioeconomic problems progress has been made in

health education economic community development and social services
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#30:1:A> Such progress is often linked to aboriginal peoples having

culturally appropriate services controlled by aboriginal peoples
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#31:1:A> I'm proud to be a part of a government that recognizes the enormous

potential that our young people <}> <-> offer </-> <=> have to offer </=>

</}> and that is prepared to invest in their abilities and to give them hope

and opportunities for the future
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#32:1:A> This government has implemented a number of programs and services

we feel that will help aboriginal youth and other youth as well recognize

their strengths and grow to their full potential and to see the sun on the

horizon in an optimistic uhm manner
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#33:1:A> I as Secretary of State for Training and Youth along with the

Minister of Human Resources Development we have announced a youth strategy
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#34:1:A> This strategy will attack some of the root causes for turning <,>

youth into young offenders
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#35:1:A> In my riding uhm Madam Speaker last month uhm we made ah a

contribution to ah a youth program with the Gwich'in people
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#36:1:A> The Gwich'in people have taken it upon themselves to build their

own healing centre to deal with many of their social and justice issues many

of their health issues
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#37:1:A> And they have done so ah along with the partnerships <}> <->

they're </-> <=> that they're </=> </}> building with people who have the

expertise from in and outside of their own communities
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#38:1:A> Last month we announced thirty-seven projects as part of the first

wave of Youth Service Canada
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#39:1:A> We feel it's necessary to send a signal out there that young people

can be contributing to their community and not taking away from their

community with what <}> <-> many </-> <=> uh many </=> </}> attribute to

young people as being very negative as only young offenders tend to get all

of the stories and all of the ink and all of the news media covering them
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#40:1:A> There are many young people out there who are doing wonderful

things who are not being celebrated and who are not being recognized
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#41:1:A> Youth Service Canada aims to help eighteen to twenty-four <}> <->

years </-> <=> year olds </=> </}> gain work experience develop their skills

learn good work habits improve their self-esteem through community service

projects
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#42:1:A> I wish you to know Madam Speaker that Youth Service Canada should

provide opportunities for youth to break away from the socioeconomic factors

which have held them back and have seduced <}> <-> them into some life of uh

uh some life in </-> <=> some who have uh basically become involved in a life

of crime </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#43:1:A> Just recently Madam Speaker it should be noted that I attended the

University of Calgary's graduation uh for their native students
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#44:1:A> They graduated eighteen native students with <}> <-> university <.>

d </.> </-> <=> university degrees </=> </}> some of them with a Bachelor of

Social Work some of them with a Bachelor of Education
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#45:1:A> There was a young girl there who or a young woman who uhm uh

graduated with an engineering degree
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#46:1:A> Those young people are very healthy models outstanding citizens who

will help their communities and this country as well
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#47:1:A> So far Madam Speaker it's not all bad news
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#48:1:A> Amongst these eighteen uh people <}> <-> that </-> <=> uhm that

</=> </}> graduated from the University of Calgary they did so under the

leadership of uh one Mister <@> Rob Carion </@> who works with native

students across this country who works on the uh Calgary Police Commission

and contributes in a number of ways
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#49:1:A> But it takes leadership and it takes caring
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#50:1:A> It takes generosity <}> <-> that uh that </-> <=> expressed </=>

</}> to these <}> <-> young <.> peop </.> </-> <=> young people </=> </}> to

encourage them to let them know that the government cares that people in

their community care that we in this House my <}> <-> <.> hol </.> </-> <=>

honourable colleagues </=> </}> and along with myself care about them and are

directing our efforts to deal with those things
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#51:1:A> Thus far Madam Speaker across Canada from all the colleges and

universities we have graduated ninety-two thousand aboriginal graduates from

universities and colleges
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#52:1:A> That's quite a huge cadre of professionals who would contribute in

some way to their community
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#53:1:A> On Monday I was reading the newspaper from the <}> <-> <.> Ed </.>

</-> <=> Edmonton </=> </}> <}> <-> <.> J </.> </-> <=> Journal </=> </}>

Madam Speaker and in there they featured also the graduation of native law

students
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#54:1:A> There were about <}> <-> five or </-> <=> <five or six/=> </}> of

them on the front of this
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#55:1:A> And I knew most of them uh but the one that sort of leaped out at

me was uh none other than Mister <@> Josh Tanguay </@> from the Northwest

Territories an already twenty year veteran a native student a twenty year

veteran of the R C M P <&> Royal Canadian Mounted Police </&> who's

contributed to his community and to his country
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#56:1:A> He's a proud Canadian who's worked hard for law and order in this

country
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#57:1:A> He's a proud Canadian who has worked for his young people in his

community
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#58:1:A> He's a model for these young people
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#59:1:A> That is how it's done
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#60:1:A> Success is the way in the native communities to bring further

successes
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#61:1:A> So these ninety-two thousand people that have graduated thus far

<,> along with these law students who were uhm uh on the uh front of the

Edmonton Journal is the way to go
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#62:1:A> There's more than one way to deal with the whole issue <}> <-> of

</-> <=> uh of </=> </}> young offenders and the whole issue of social

justice <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> a number of other justice issues

as well
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#63:1:A> There is rehabilitated but there's also the way of leadership young

people who set an example as these people will do
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#64:1:A> Madam Speaker uhm a part of the consultations uh on the concept of

Youth <}> <-> <.> Ser </.> </-> <=> Service </=> </}> Canada had me <}> <->

in </-> <=> <,> in </=> </}> contact with many youth across this country

hundreds of groups that I met with
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#65:1:A> And I had the occasion to go to the <,> stadium
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#66:1:A> Uh we talk about all the bad things that are happening Madam

Speaker
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#67:1:A> I went <}> <-> to </-> <=> uhm <,> uhm <,> ah <}> <-> a </-> <=> to

the </=> </}> </=> </}> stadium <}> <-> in </-> <=> in </=> </}> Toronto the

SkyDome
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#68:1:A> There were fifty thousand young people at the SkyDome
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#69:1:A> These young people were there with their school boards and these

fifty thousand young people were celebrating in a positive way what they call

the Journey of Hope
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#70:1:A> And they were accompanied by their teachers
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#71:1:A> This was <}> <-> a positive </-> <=> uhm uh a positive </=> </}>

celebration to show that young people in this country are not just involved

in crimes that they are doing many wonderful things
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#72:1:A> I had the occasion to be at many many uh graduations across the

country many of which involved aboriginal youth but many which involve

ordinary Canadian citizens across this country
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#73:1:A> It's positive
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#74:1:A> <}> <-> It's </-> <=> It's </=> </}> wonderful to see people doing

something constructive which they get no credit for
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#75:1:A> So I'd just like to celebrate that with you Madam Speaker and uh my

honourable colleagues here
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#76:1:A> Speaking about <}> <-> the </-> <=> uhm <,> the </=> </}> Youth

Service Canada project I believe that every department every Crown

corporation will do its part to forge those ah partnerships that will produce

healthier young people more well contributing young people across this

country
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#77:1:A> In my language we have what's called <indig> Dene Tulu </indig>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#78:1:A> <indig> Dene Tulu </indig> I speak a Dene language and <indig> Dene

Tulu </indig> is uh the path that you walk on
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#79:1:A> The path that you walk on Madam Speaker is the path of your own

choosing
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#80:1:A> We've integrated that as one stream into the youth service corps

because we need young people who have been marginalized who have been left

out who have dropped <}> <-> out of the </-> <=> out of schools </=> </}>

they've dropped out of learning they've dropped out of the labour market and

essentially they become so marginalized they drop out of life
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#81:1:A> We need to rebuild confidence
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#82:1:A> We have to get them back to work back to learning
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#83:1:A> And we have uh this stream called the <indig> Dene Tulu </indig> >

which uh or which is called <indig> Tulu </indig> which would have them

contributing
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#84:1:A> It is uhm <O> cough </O>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#85:1:A> Whether the path that you choose <,> is good or bad is really up to

you
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#86:1:A> That's a Dene form of justice
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#87:1:A> <indig> Tulu </indig> is one of our four guiding themes for Youth

Service Canada project
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#88:1:A> <indig> Tulu </indig> could directly assist those young offenders

who are in community based rehabilitation programs
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#89:1:A> Young offenders were also prominent at some of our consultations

across Canada along with the disabled and along with <}> <-> the <.> s </.>

</-> <=> the homeless </=> </}> youth
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#90:1:A> Youth Service Canada is one part of the government's actions to

help young people to make the transition from school to the workforce or to

reintegrate into society
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#91:1:A> There are many attempts Madam Speaker that we could uh talk about

that the government has put forward
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#92:1:A> We put forward a youth strategy
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#93:1:A> We have a youth internship program
<ICE-CAN:S1B-054#94:1:A> On these uh very few days of the past we've been discussing the

changes to the Canada student loans program which will help young people to

participate in a positive way in their learning for future jobs that they

will engage in for building for I guess nation building ehm exercises in

their community at the community level as well as in their region </I>
