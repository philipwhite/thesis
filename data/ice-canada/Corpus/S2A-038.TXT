<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-038#1:1:A> Along with my husband who <,> did exactly the same thing I did

only he doesn't have a theatre because like it was <unclear> word </unclear>

but
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#2:1:A> <unclear> three words </unclear> like <,> really ridiculously insane

<O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#3:1:A> I mean it's all so <unclear> <?> ridiculous </?> </unclear> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#4:1:A> <{> <[> Why should </[>

<$ZA> <ICE-CAN:S2A-038#5:1:Z> <[> <O> someone comments </O> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-038#6:1:A> Uhm so <}> <-> we went </-> <=> we went </=> </}> straight up

and we hiked through <}> <-> the uh </-> <=> the </=> </}> <unclear> word

</unclear> uhm went through the wonderful <unclear> three or four words

</unclear>

<$ZB> <ICE-CAN:S2A-038#7:1:Z> <O> laugh </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-038#8:1:A> What do you <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> do <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#9:1:A> And where do you <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> go
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#10:1:A> And we impressed everybody on the very first day <,> by telling

them that we wanted to go to Killiniq <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#11:1:A> <}> <-> On the top <,> right </-> <=> right smack on the tip of

</=> </}> Ungava Bay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#12:1:A> Cos we looked at the map and we thought ohh that is so cool
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#13:1:A> It's like right in the middle of nowhere
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#14:1:A> Right in the middle of all this water around
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#15:1:A> And everybody roared with laughter because <,> Killiniq doesn't

really exist <O> laughs with audience </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#16:1:A> It's on the map but nobody lives there
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#17:1:A> There's no village there's nothing it's just a dot on a map so
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#18:1:A> I think we impressed everybody by wanting to go to the dot on the

map <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#19:1:A> So instead they sent us to nearly the smallest community that we

have because yeah
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#20:1:A> And they sent us to Tasiujaq which is right here <}> <-> on uhm uhm

</-> <=> on </=> </}> Ungava Bay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#21:1:A> Guess you don't <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#22:1:A> You guys should know your geography well enough to know that this

is Ungava Bay this is Hudson Bay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#23:1:A> And uh Tasiujaq is the second little village uh like a hundred and

twenty people <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#24:1:A> Pretty small guys
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#25:1:A> Really really really small <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#26:1:A> Uhm and we were there for one year <,> and at the end of that year

uhm <unclear> word </unclear> people village and it's the largest <,> Inuit

village that <,> uhm is in Quebec that's well in Northern Quebec basically
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#27:1:A> Uhm Kuujjuaq is bigger <,> over here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#28:1:A> It's the sort of big <,> uhm <,> administrative centre and

everything <,> and you'll see it in the news every so often
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#29:1:A> If you ever see anything to do with Northern Quebec nine out of ten

it's either Kuujjuaq or you will have heard of Great Whale <indig> <unclear>

two words </unclear> </indig> because of the hydro project
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#30:1:A> That's where they've chosen to do the hydro project <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#31:1:A> So that's sometimes in the news as well
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#32:1:A> Uh Kuujjuaq is bigger than Inukjuak it's got a thousand seven

hundred people roughly but it's pretty much <,> uhm <,,> it's not really

divided three ways <,> it's almost fifty-fifty white <,> or southern

southerner however
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#33:1:A> <}> <-> <.> W </.> <.> w </.> </-> <=> We </=> </}> call white

people even if we're not white kind of in the north like <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#34:1:A> We had a Jamaican teacher who thought it was the funniest thing to

be called a white person all the time <unclear> four or five words </unclear>

be called a white man <O> laughs with audience </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#35:1:A> He thought that was great
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#36:1:A> Uh but that's how they refer to us so

<$ZC> <ICE-CAN:S2A-038#37:1:Z> <O> audience member comments </O> <&> possibly a cough </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-038#38:1:A> Uhm and there're uh quite a few white <,> French Canadians

English Canadians working there living there
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#39:1:A> So the school is actually <,> not fifty-fifty but a lot of the

students there English is their mother tongue
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#40:1:A> As opposed to Inuktitut where <unclear> word </unclear> it's not

the kids and <unclear> three words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#41:1:A> So <}> <-> that's where </-> <=> that's where </=> </}> we were and

what we uh <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#42:1:A> We were both teaching
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#43:1:A> <}> <-> I was uh </-> <=> For the first year </=> </}> I taught

grades five six seven split <@> George </@> taught all of secondary <,> uhm

<O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#44:1:A> And he was principal for the year <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#45:1:A> Uhm <,> and then when we moved over to Inukjuak we were <,> spoiled
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#46:1:A> That's why we only <unclear> two or three words </unclear> cos you

have pretty much single level classes and I taught grade six and <,> grade

seven so
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#47:1:A> We spent <,> uhm two years indoctrinating the <unclear> word

</unclear> and the <unclear> <?> women <?> <O> laugh </O> <?> thinking </?>

</unclear> cos they go from me to him
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#48:1:A> Worked really well
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#49:1:A> It was really nice
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#50:1:A> Uhm <,> uhm <,> now <}> <-> he's </-> <=> he's </=> </}> still up

there this year teaching grade seven but I think it's his last year <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#51:1:A> Little wonders in grade seven <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#52:1:A> Grade seven well now <,> you're all sort of saying <O> starts

speaking very softly </O> grade seven that's <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to

</+> </}> be real hard <unclear> two words </unclear> grade seven <O> stops

speaking very softly </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#53:1:A> We do <,> <unclear> two words </unclear> we need clientele and that

they're all <,,> <unclear> <?> ninety </?> </unclear> point nine percent

Inuit children and so their mother tongue is Inuktitut <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#54:1:A> And when they come to us they come to English in grade three <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#55:1:A> Uhm and then <}> <-> they start all their content </-> <=> they do

all their content </=> </}> subjects in English
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#56:1:A> They still have Inuktitut uhm
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#57:1:A> I think <unclear> <?> that out here </?> </unclear> they have it

everyday <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#58:1:A> But it's slowly <,> sort of <,> filters down to about three times a

week <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#59:1:A> And they have culture class which is usually a morning or an

afternoon every week <}> <-> where they're </-> <=> that's in Inuktitut </=>

</}> and the girls <,> sew and the guys hunt <O> audible breath </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#60:1:A> Uhm <{> <[> <O> laughs with audience </O> </[>

<$ZD> <ICE-CAN:S2A-038#61:1:Z> <[> <O> audience member asks a question </O> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-038#62:1:A> <,,> They probably wouldn't take choice
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#63:1:A> I mean they do <}> <-> <.> th </.> </-> <=> there's </=> </}>

sometimes <,> like the girls will go out fishing and stuff and like they will

do things together but <,> they probably wouldn't also <,> pick either option

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-038#64:1:A> <{> <[> The girls will prefer </[> to do that

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-038#67:1:A> <[> No no </[> </{> and every year
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#68:1:A> Now <,> uhm <,> some of the things I say are also village-peculiar

<,> but <}> <-> most most villages </-> <=> all villages </=> </}> have some

sort of budget to go on well not big trips like outdoor trips
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#69:1:A> And when we were in Inukjuak every year we went out uhm in the

spring <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#70:1:A> Either with the older kids on a camping trip and the younger kids

would go for a day fishing trip
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#71:1:A> So you'd go with everybody <}> <-> and and and </-> <=> and </=>

</}> <unclear> word </unclear> village they've got it's <unclear> <O>

muttering </O> </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#72:1:A> It's great fun
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#73:1:A> That was a lot of fun
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#74:1:A> And then I went camping that's with the <?> second group </?> <&>

could be seventh grade </&> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#75:1:A> And so yeah you can join in
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#76:1:A> <}> <-> You <,> </-> <=> Generally what happens </=> </}> <}> <->

at one </-> <=> during those </=> </}> well the three periods of culture a

week that are nice big <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#77:1:A> The last thing you really <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}>

do is go out of town <}> <-> and </-> all week <=> and </=> </}> this is <}>

<-> your your </-> <=> your </=> </}> <}> <-> kinda </-> <+> kind of </+>

</}> time that you have to do other things but
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#78:1:A> But if you wanted to join in and wanted to go down and see what

they're doing that wouldn't be a problem except that they are doing <unclear>

three words </unclear> so <,> uhm sometimes
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#79:1:A> Like all the culture teachers are elders in the village and they

speak no English so maybe they understand a bit but <}> <-> they </-> <=>

they </=> </}> couldn't tell you what you're doing basically
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#80:1:A> So if you've got a lower grade <,> you have to rely on your kids to

tell you what they're doing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#81:1:A> It can be a bit difficult but

<$ZE> <ICE-CAN:S2A-038#82:1:Z> <O> audience member comments </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-038#83:1:A> But yeah you know I mean we're welcome <}> <-> <.> t </.> </->

<=> to </=> </}> join in and find out about what's going on <,> <O> cough in

audience </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#84:1:A> So in terms of pedagogical things <}> <-> we </-> <=> we're not

</=> </}> really teaching we are teaching a second language but we are

teaching everything in a second language <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#85:1:A> So from a pedagogical standpoint <}> <-> it </-> <=> it's </=> </}>

not really E S L
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#86:1:A> We always come up with an appropriate name
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#87:1:A> I call it <unclear> word </unclear> E S L and everybody has a

different term for it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#88:1:A> Like right now the board trying to come up with a good political

term to use <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#89:1:A> Uhm <,> so that means that <,> should
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#90:1:A> And if you apply to be hired <,> <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#91:1:A> You'll have to teach math and science and well depending on what

uhm <,> grade levels you're looking at
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#92:1:A> In primary you teach math science social studies English <,> uhm

<,> art <O> noise of uncertainty </O> you can teach
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#93:1:A> Well that all depends
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#94:1:A> Some people really think that's a great idea and then people freak

<O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#95:1:A> Uh <}> <-> you </-> <=> you </=> </}> may <}> <-> in one <.> o </.>

</-> <=> if you're </=> </}> in a small village be asked to teach gym as well

<,> but that's not so bad
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#96:1:A> And <}> <-> that's </-> <=> that's </=> </}> basically what all you

teach
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#97:1:A> In secondary it breaks down to science becomes things like ecology
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#98:1:A> Uhm <,> social studies gets sort of broken down into history

geography but they're lumped in together
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#99:1:A> Uhm <,> <}> <-> there are </-> <=> there is </=> </}> physics and

chemistry but most of the time <}> <-> they're </-> <=> the board's </=> </}>

leaning to uh hiring specialists to do the math <,> and physics and chemistry

cos that's just specialized
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#100:1:A> I mean <,> that was my one thing when <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=>

</}> remember being here it's if I have to teach secondary math science and

physics put me in primary
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#101:1:A> And that's how I ended up in grade six cos mm mm <,> algebra <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#102:1:A> Never thought about that you know <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#103:1:A> It's one of those things that once I thought about it I went mm mm

I won't do that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#104:1:A> But some people are comfortable with it and then you'd probably go

to a smaller village where they don't have a specialist
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#105:1:A> But most villages <}> <-> are </-> <,> <=> are </=> </}> <}> <->

gettin </-> <+> getting </+> </}> a math science specialist who gets to teach

math and science <,> <O> noise from audience </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#106:1:A> Uhm <,> <}> <-> and and </-> <=> and </=> </}> in <?> Senga </?>

those people are often not E S L specialists so they often have <,,> more

difficulty <}> <-> that you can </-> <=> in adapting </=> </}> to uh <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#107:1:A> Like <}> <-> it's easier for us to pick up </-> <=> I find it's

easier for TESL people to pick up </=> </}> a book <,> <}> <-> on </-> <=> on

</=> </}> uh ecology <}> <-> and and </-> <=> or </=> </}> biology or

something like that <,> and read it and figure out what it is we have to do

and know how to teach a lesson on it <,> than it is for a biology person to

think that oh my god how is someone who doesn't speak my language <}> <->

gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> learn this
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#108:1:A> They don't have <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> <,> ingrained

drummed into your head techniques that we all have
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#109:1:A> And so often the TESL specialists are <,> in <unclear> quite a few

words </unclear> a lot of <,> content people who'll be asked to be your

assistants <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#110:1:A> Does happen
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#111:1:A> Uhm when things break down <}> <-> I I </-> <=> I </=> </}>

thought oh I'll have <unclear> quite a few words </unclear> little teeny

piece of chalk here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#112:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#113:1:A> I sat there everyday and I never even looked at this myself
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#114:1:A> In the primary sector <,> we have <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#115:1:A> Oh don't worry you'll never get this <O> laugh </O> so <}> <->

I'll just </-> <=> I'll say </=> </}> it out loud
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#116:1:A> Uhm <,> in <,> we have <,,> four hundred and sixty-five students

in Inuktitut so that's basically grade five to grade three grade two
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#117:1:A> We have this is a new <unclear> word </unclear> this is a sudden

change five hundred and sixty-eight students study French and we have <,,>

four hundred and fifty students studying English
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#118:1:A> That's the first time to my knowledge <,> to my knowledge that

that balance shifted
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#119:1:A> Normally <}> <-> it's either <.> fif </.> </-> <=> it has been

</=> </}> fifty fifty or more on the English side so
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#120:1:A> Hmm <O> laugh </O> <,> I wonder <,> what that means
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#121:1:A> And in secondary we just have English and French <,,> no more

Inuktitut
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#122:1:A> Well they're still learning Inuktitut like they have Inuktitut <}>

<-> class </-> <=> language class </=> </}> every week uhm or couple times a

week
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#123:1:A> <}> <-> That's </-> <=> This is </=> </}> more like <,,> uhm <,,>

seventy-eight
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#124:1:A> And for kindergarten <,> this is a funny one cos <,> there's one

village Kuujjuaq and Kuujjuaq likes to be different uhm that has a sort of

experiment going on <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#125:1:A> And they start
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#126:1:A> Where are my numbers
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#127:1:A> Where did they go
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#128:1:A> Oh there they are
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#129:1:A> Start from there
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#130:1:A> They start uhm <,,> French <O> loud feedback type noise on tape

</O> in kindergarten
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#131:1:A> And it's the only village and they have all the Cree students <O>

laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#132:1:A> So <,> two hundred and sixteen <,> little lovely ones <,> in uhm

kindergarten
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#133:1:A> So <}> <-> <.> y </.> </-> <=> I </=> </}> don't know if you're

getting a vision of how many little kids there are running around this place

but there are a few of them
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#134:1:A> So all in all there are <,> <}> <-> two hundred </-> <=> two

thousand </=> </}> five hundred and seventy students in the north <,> from a

population of seven thousand people
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#135:1:A> That's <,> about forty percent of the population
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#136:1:A> Inukjuak my old village <,> uh one of the years that we were there

there was a StatsCan <&> Statistics Canada </&> thing that came out <}> <->

and </-> <=> and </=> </}> <}> <-> it </-> <=> it </=> </}> had the highest

birth rate per capita <,> in Canada <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#137:1:A> There were almost more babies than there were adults at one point

<O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#138:1:A> There was a baby born every week <,> that whole year
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#139:1:A> Uhm <,> and if not more than one
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#140:1:A> There's at least one child born a week <O> laugh </O>

<$ZF> <ICE-CAN:S2A-038#141:1:Z> <{> <[> <O> whistle in audience </O> </[>

<O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#143:1:A> <,> Uhm so and you can tell they're like <unclear> three words

</unclear> keeps coming up in the system
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#144:1:A> And in Inukjuak over the few years that I was there we started off

in my first year we had forty kids going into kindergarten <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-038#145:1:A> By the time I left there were <}> <-> three kindergartens of of

uhm </-> <=> four kindergartens </=> </}> of twenty kids each <,,>
