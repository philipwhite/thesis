<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#1:1> Dear <@> Dorothy </@> , </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#2:1> Yesterday I went to Vancouver - met <@> Jill </@> and <@> Bob </@>

( and their guest <@> Helen </@> who had some " points" and came all across

the country to spend some time with them.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#3:1> They have good friends) at the <@> PDT </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#4:1> The Milnes were overwhelming, both in numbers and quality.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#5:1> I thought I knew how Milne painted and would know his work whenever I

saw it, but there were several paintings I wouldn't have believed were his.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#6:1> You <ul> must </ul> see the show.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#7:1> It will be at the <}> <-> <.> Nat. </.> </-> <=> National </=> </}>

<}> <-> <.> Gall. </.> </-> <=> Gallery </=> </}> from July 1 - September 7.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#8:1> I hope it impresses the tourists! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#9:1> <@> Jill </@> and <@> Bob </@> are in a " cute" little <?> brick

</?> doll's house <fnr> * </fnr> - one room <}> <-> + </-> <+> and </+> </}>

staircase wide with a balcony from a second bedroom over the doorway.

<footnote> *inset indeed - it almost touched the houses on either side -

result light comes in only at front <}> <-> + </-> <+> and </+> </}> back <}>

<-> + </-> <+> and </+> </}> skylights </footnote>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#10:1> Comfortably furnished and equipped. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#11:1> <@> Russ </@> is halfway through his treatment: will have his

last session of <}> <-> <.> chemo </.> </-> <=> chemotherapy </=> </}> the

first week in March - then wait a month - have a scan - and depending on

results - there will or will not be surgery.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#12:1> <@> Russ </@> has been working at Whistler.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#13:1> <@> Jill </@> said that <del> last </del> a week ago last Friday

night when <@> Russ </@> went off with his friends, taking a lot of the food

she had " laid in" for him, she and <@> Bob </@> were left with the dishes

feeling very bereft.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#14:1> They came out to look after their " baby" and he's independent.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#15:1> But <@> Donald </@> tells them <@> Russ </@> was at home longer than

<@> Donald </@> and <@> Bob </@> were ( because he got more education) and

they must now expect him to be independent. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#16:1> <@> J. </@> and <@> B. </@> will go to Calgary to see <@> Donald

</@> in March because <@> Donald </@> can't leave just now - economic

conditions too tight and must stay on the job. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#17:1> I'm hoping that if <@> Russ </@> and a friend would like to go to

Pacific Rim <@> Jill </@> and <@> Bob </@> will take them over in March -

good whale-watching time!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#18:1> And if <@> Russ </@> doesn't want to go they'll " take" me.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#19:1> We shall see. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#20:1> I'm finished with professional <}> <-> <.> appts </.> </-> <=>

appointments </=> </}> for the time being.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#21:1> My vision is much improved over the last few months - almost 20-20.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#22:1> Dr. <@> Hildebrand </@> is going to report the success to Dr. <@>

York </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#23:1> My will seemed a little odd - but <@> Jean </@> said its terms would

provide flexibility; and she has sent me a letter of advice - re listing and

storing documents for convenience and ease in administering the estate and

outlining what possible events might make a review or change of will

necessary.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#24:1> Very helpful!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#25:1> And thrown in, as it were, one sheet of your letter, enclosure of <@>

Michael </@> 's note and Canada Trust statement.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#26:1> <@> Michael </@> is having marvellous sightings!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#27:1> And so good of him to tell me about them.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#28:1> As for Canada Trust - at least they got the statement sent to you,

even <}> <-> <.> <w> tho' </w> </.> </-> <+> though </+> </}> the postal code

is wrong, and I note - what I didn't " see" on the other one - that " I am

joint owner" of your two investments.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#29:1> Don't bother sending me the statement.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#30:1> I return it in case - in case what? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#31:1> Lots of to-ing and fro-ing in India!?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#32:1> I wish I had a map. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#33:1> Perhaps I'll receive later the missing sheet of your letter which

may tell me if you are going to Netherlands for professional reasons or "

just" to travel - I can't remember " A high wind in Jamaica".
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#34:1> Could read it again. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#35:1> I read Gail Bowen's <ul> Murder at the Mendel </ul> and would

love to know the reaction of the citizens of Saskatoon, the members of the

university, and the staff at the Mendel.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#36:1> An exhibit of paintings, featuring a huge mural a la who was it's

Dinner Party, except that <ul> mural </ul> depicts genitalia of both sexes.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#37:1> - the Mendel director a weak creature - the mural is by his wife who

has left him - ! !
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#38:1> Bowen has a mean eye for human frailty. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#39:1> <h> Saturday morning </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#40:1> Today I will go to 620 <@> Lake </@> <}> <-> <.> St </.> </-> <+>

Street </+> </}> Open House - it's Development Week - and visit <@> DETA </@>

<@> Queenville </@> , South Pacific <w> Peoples' </w> Foundation, VIDEA,

Oxfam <@> Queenville </@> Outreach ( all one organization!) and UNA <@>

Queenville </@> Branch. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#41:1> I bought the David Milne book ( exhibition catalog) edited by Ian

M. Thom, Senior Curator, <@> PDT </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#42:1> <ul> Must </ul> find out if he is Ron's son.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#43:1> Canadian cataloguing in Publication Data: <ul> Main entry under title

</ul> : David Milne.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#44:1> Who would look under David?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#45:1> However there is an added entry under Milne, granted this kind of

publication is not easy to catalog. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#46:1> There are several essays in the book - one on <ul> David Milne's

New York </ul> by Lora Senechal Carney ( who she?), in which a long paragraph

contrasts Milne's drawings and paintings of New York with the etchings of

Joseph Pennell.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#47:1> Do you remember the little booklet of Aunt <@> Mary </@> 's <ul> The

Great New York </ul> by Joseph Pennell with the XXIII ( 23) small <}> <-> <.> "

repros" </.> </-> <+> reproductions </+> </}> of etchings depicting New York

streets and buildings.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#48:1> Number IV is <ul> The Unbelievable City </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#49:1> Reproduced in the Milne book is a J.P. etching with the same title.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#50:1> They are obviously the same " views", but the interesting thing is

that they are not exactly the same.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#51:1> What I deduce must be the Singer Building is central to in both, but

other buildings vary - whether changed over time or by Pennell's whim caused

this is beyond me to decide; perhaps neither is a totally realistic

representation.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#52:1> I think I will find a way - ( perhaps simply by mailing it to him) to

show <@> Shaun Ford </@> the booklet.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#53:1> It would be a means of finding out what sort of reproductions they

are.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#54:1> ( <@> Paula </@> couldn't tell me - do you remember?).
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#55:1> If they have any value or interest for art historians here, <@> Shaun

Ford </@> might be the person to decide.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#56:1> And if there is value or interest, he could surely find the right

place for them.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#57:1> What do you think? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#58:1> <@> Craig Murray </@> up at Lewis shoes has the shoes recently

ordered for my approval.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#59:1> ( Ordered at the same time for <@> Mandy Maude </@> was a pair of SAS

shoes in burgundy.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#60:1> Brian seems to consider <@> Maude </@> a distinguished customer!)
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#61:1> These are walking shoes, which will put more sole than I've been

wearing between me and the sidewalk.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#62:1> I have a " better-looking" pair in which I can't ( at least up to

now) walk uptown in comfort, but which I can wear when I drive and only walk

from car to building or house. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#63:1> Back to the etchings: <}> <-> <.> no </.> </-> <+> number </+>

</}> III is titled <ul> Palacades and Palaces </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#64:1> So you think this was a deliberate mistake?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#65:1> Anyhow it's a new word.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#66:1> Into the dictionary, I looked up <ul> <mention> synecdoche </mention>

</ul> !
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#67:1> I must watch for this figure of speech, which must be commonly used

in proverbs!? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#68:1> Would you be devastated if <@> Hubert </@> became a successor to

Wayne Gretzky or Eric Lindros?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#69:1> How about Kurt Browning?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#70:1> I have my fingers crossed for Kurt. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#71:1> Love
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#72:1> Mum </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#73:2> Dear <@> Dorothy </@> : I have been busy - a concert Saturday

night at <@> UQueen </@> - <@> LeFaivre </@> quartet - in residence all

women, <@> Teri </@> , <@> Carrie T </@> and I went.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#74:2> <@> Teri </@> thinks <quote> they will be better when they mature a

little, they attack the music with splendid technique </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#75:2> And that seems fair enough.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#76:2> <@> UQueen </@> has taken them to its heart. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#77:2> Sunday - a super concert <@> John Lord </@> conducting and <@>

Aleksei Yakovich </@> playing the Tchaikovsky violin concerts and Saint-Saens

<ul> Intro and rondo capriccioso </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#78:2> So you remember the 78 rpm of it by <@> Sasha Kiefer </@> ?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#79:2> My records ( written) tell me that I heard <@> A. Y. </@> play the

Tchaikovsky at Ontario Place Forum with TSO under <@> Geldinger </@> in 1979!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#80:2> But I did not remember him, <}> <-> <.> <w> tho' </w> </.> </-> <+>

though </+> </}> I have heard him a few times at the V.I. Festival here. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#81:2> Monday I had my teeth cleaned - it took an hour! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#82:2> Yesterday, I saw <@> Jean Harrison </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#83:2> I like her!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#84:2> I go back to sign the will next Monday.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#85:2> It is to include a statement that the estate is to pay shipping costs

to get my body to <@> UWC </@> if they accept it.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#86:2> Today saw Dr. <@> Hales </@> for medical examination re driver's

license.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#87:2> I am in excellent health - Dr. <@> Hales </@> thinks it might be good

to have massage therapy for my shoulders.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#88:2> I asked!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#89:2> So I probably will.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#90:2> I am to see Dr. <@> Hildebrand </@> on Tuesday, which is just right

for the driver's license exam-questionnaire. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#91:2> This afternoon I wrote to <@> Jill </@> and <@> Bob </@> - I am

going to Vancouver next Thursday and will meet them at the Art Gallery for

the Milne show.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#92:2> <@> Russ </@> has had his second week of <}> <-> <.> chemo </.> </->

<=> chemotherapy </=> </}> and lost all his hair.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#93:2> His friends rally around.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#94:2> <@> Jill </@> says he gets dressed at hospital and gets right " out

of there" when he can - everybody else stays in bed.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#95:2> ( but maybe they are older).
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#96:2> He can't eat the hospital food, so <@> Jill </@> takes food to him.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#97:2> The nurses say cold food is easier to manage.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#98:2> But he ate <@> Jill </@> 's leek soup!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#99:2> ( at home)
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#100:2> It is great that they can be here.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#101:2> <@> Russ </@> went back to Whistler with friends and their ( <@> J.

</@> and <@> B. </@> 's) only concern is that he won't drink enough water - 4

or 5 litres a day or some such.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#102:2> But if attitude helps, he has the right one, I think. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#103:2> Did I tell you I had a letter from <@> U.W.C. </@>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#104:2> I answered it today and asked if I might be assured that cremation,

for which they pay, might include final disposition of the ashes.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#105:2> In between I have been phoning all the contact names for

organizations in the Global Village Network, so we can invite them to the

Esperanto week of International Friendship celebration on Saturday February

22.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#106:2> Incidentally, I am to talk a bit about our proverbs project. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#107:2> I have read Ann Davis <ul> Somewhere Waiting: The life and art

of Christiane Pflug </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#108:2> Do you know her paintings?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#109:2> It's a remarkable biography, I think.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#110:2> Christiane spent a good deal of time in Wuppertal and some in

northern Africa, before " eventually" coming to Canada.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#111:2> I don't know any " Canadian" biography like it - where we know the

geography - Toronto streets, Toronto Island, AV Isaacs Gallery.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#112:2> And I can't imagine Christiane's husband being willing to have his

personality revealed as he was seemingly eager to do.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#113:2> Made me think of Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#114:2> And I've almost finished a new life of Van Gogh.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#115:2> <ul> The love of many things </ul> by David Sweetman.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#116:2> Gives a slant I didn't have! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#117:2> Great that <@> Michael </@> has seen so many birds - and has

arrived safely in India!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#118:2> I had a short letter from him with the usual admonition to keep on

saving stamps!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#119:2> As if I wouldn't! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#120:2> I expect you are busy with much more to do than I have.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#121:2> Have recent temperatures there been very cold?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#122:2> I can't judge in Celsius, but see they have moderated.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#123:2> Here it rains and blows and shines and then rains and blows again.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#124:2> Some words on a separate sheet.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#125:2> Hi to <@> Hubert </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#126:2> Love, Mum. </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#127:3> Dear <@> Dorothy </@> : I have entered some engagements for 1992

in <ul> Herstory </ul> , which I am very pleased to have.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#128:3> I missed it last year and feared it had ceased publication.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#129:3> Why don't you just give it - or give just it - to me every year?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#130:3> I appreciate your effort to enlarge ( widen?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#131:3> broaden?) my horizons and vary my menus as a vegetarian, but I fear

<marginalia> think </marginalia> I am in a very comfortable rut. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#132:3> <@> Teri </@> and I had dinner with <@> Carrie </@> today - 5

o'clock - and it was a very good dinner.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#133:3> But it reinforced my realization that I may at some time have

difficulty adapting my tastes and my digestion to institutional food. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#134:3> So glad you found the knitting books.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#135:3> Will pursue.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#136:3> It would be wonderful if I could be motivated to knit myself a

sweater.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#137:3> There's an outdoor jacket-sweater I see in the elevator which is

gorgeous.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#138:3> Beautiful shape, beautiful greeny-blue colors. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-007#139:3> You are not clear ( to me) about <@> Joan </@> and Mrs. <@>

Stornoway </@> 's.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#140:3> I'm glad she ( <@> Joan </@> ) got a dessert.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#141:3> Why wasn't it amusing " in itself" that you had dinner with the <@>

Warmans </@> ?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#142:3> It's the man before <@> Jon Summers </@> who drives me crazy.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#143:3> I wish <@> Rod Hatley </@> had stayed where he was.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-007#144:3> I seldom listen to more than the news on the radio - but this

morning heard a record of Glen Gould playing Bach's <ul> Goldberg Variations

</ul> - on R.S.V.P. <O> end of letter </O> </p> </I>
