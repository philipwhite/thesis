<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#4:1> Essay by JEFF FAIR

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#5:1> AT NOON ON A DAY IN LATE May, I drive my little skiff into the

northernmost bay of Azisco <l> hos Lake, a hydroelectric reservoir not far

from the Quebec border in western Maine.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#6:1> Right on schedule: I have spent half the day wandering along the

western shoreline, spying on loon pairs and record <l> ing evidence of

nesting, and will spend the remain <l> der floating leisurely back down the

east side with an eye out for my charges.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#7:1> Someone has to do it, and I hap <l> pen to like the work. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#8:1> For 11 years, I was employed by the Audubon Society of New

Hampshire as chief biologist and philosopher of its loon-recovery project.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#9:1> Now I work directly for the loons and am paid for my efforts largely

by power companies, which are inspired by the Federal Energy Regulatory Com

<l> mission in Washington, D.C., to worry about how water-level changes on

their impounded lakes affect the resident loons and their reproductive

success.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#10:1> Consultant seems too formal, too brassy a title.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#11:1> Call me an independent biologist. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#12:1> This large bay is the territory belonging to and protected by a

pair of loons that I've known for eight years as the Lit <l> tle Magalloway

Pair.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#13:1> They are fishing out in the middle when I arrive.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#14:1> I motor off to a far corner with a view of the entire territory, sun

at my back, and shut off the outboard.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#15:1> Through binoculars, I watch them diving.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#16:1> They alternate, each dive lasting less than a minute.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#17:1> I suspect that even <l> tually one of them will move toward their

nest.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#18:1> Ten min <l> utes into the program, as if by coincidence, the two dive

to <l> gether.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#19:1> A full minute passes.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#20:1> Two, three, Five.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#21:1> Under these conditions - lightly overcast sky, calm water the colour

of wet concrete - a child could spot the black periscope-like head of a loon

from a kilometre away. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#22:1> I see nothing.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#23:1> I pour a cup of coffee from my thermos, eat my sandwich.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#24:1> Still nothing.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#25:1> I pour more coffee, fin <l> ish lunch, all the while watching.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#26:1> Half an hour later, I still have not seen them.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#27:1> The loons have disappeared. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#28:1> Pretty crafty.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#29:1> But not surprising.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#30:1> Much of our at <l> traction to the loon, after all, derives from its

clandes <l> tine behaviours.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#31:1> Nothing like a taste of the unknown, the mysterious, to haunt the

human mind with intrigue and in <l> spire it toward romance.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#32:1> However, there is a dark side to our romance with the loon.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#33:1> These days, many of us feel a pow <l> erful and unrequited longing

for this wild spirit on lakes from which it has disappeared completely,

chased off by human meddling or poisoned out by toxins we have dealt upon the

landscape.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#34:1> But this loss only inspires a greater affection: across Canada, a

large network of vigilantes now monitors and fos <l> ters the loon's

survival.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#35:1> Why such a spirited effort? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#36:1> <quote> " Canadians have a historical gravitation toward loons,"

</quote> a paddler in the outback of Ontario once explained to me. <X>

<quote> " Our national expansion was along waterways, by canoe.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#X37:1> We identify with the call of the loon." </quote> </X> </p> <O>

picture </O> <O> With picture perfect grace, two loons mate. For decades,

biologists firmly believed that loons formed life-long partnerships - until a

more precise form of research pointed to some wide-roaming promiscuity. </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#38:1> And exactly what is it about the call of the loon, I asked.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#39:1> <quote> " There's a certain piercing, haunting quality that tells you

there is still life out there," </quote> he said. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#X40:1> <quote> " Wild life." </quote> </X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#41:1> Then he paused. <X> <quote> " Sometimes there's something ... almost

human to it." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#42:1> The loon I refer to here is the common loon, <it> Gavia immer

</it> , provincial bird of Ontario, or <it> huart &agrave; collier </it> (

<quote> " cry in a neck <l> lace" </quote> ) to French Canadians.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#43:1> Three to seven kilograms of gristle, dance, fish oil, feather, web,

wail, and deception.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#44:1> Not to be confused with the little red-throated loon of ponds along

the subarctic coast and on the tundra, the Pa <l> cific loon of larger,

deeper lakes of northern Canada west of Hudson Bay, or the yellow-billed loon

of the far north. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#45:1> The common loon nests on lakes and ponds throughout the boreal

forest across North America.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#46:1> In Canada, its heartland, it numbers between a quarter- and a

half-million birds.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#47:1> Its beauty is one more part of its allure.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#48:1> Sexes are sim <l> ilar, their backs and sides spangled white on a

field of black and otherwise adorned with two necklaces of legendary origin,

one black dagger of a beak, glowing white breast, and eyes redder than rubies

set in a black head, sleek as satin, known by aficionados to reflect dark

iridescent green when seen up close under a particular angle of sunlight.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#49:1> Every part has its purpose - even the gaudy chessboard back serves as

camouflage on sun-dappled water or on the nest under the stippled shadows of

willow or blueberry. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#50:1> The ecologist's eye discerns yet a different kind of beauty, that

of a superbly designed organism engineered, in this case, to catch fish.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#51:1> The graceful shape allows torpedolike speed under water, powered by

two huge feet set as far aft as possi <l> ble for optimal leverage. <O>

picture </O> <O> Fiercely protective of the nest, top, a loon sensing threat

adopts " the hangover position." Eggs hatch a day apart after a 28 day

incubation. </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#52:1> The loon's bones are solid and heavy; by flattening its feathers to

remove interstitial air, a loon can make itself heavier than water and sink

vertically.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#53:1> Though their pulmonary air capacity may last only a few minutes,

loons have been captured in fish traps 60 metres down. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#54:1> The loon pays in trade-offs for these specialties.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#55:1> Because its feet are set so far back on its heavy body, it moves awk

<l> wardly on land.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#56:1> It builds its nest at the Water's edge, there <l> fore, and can gain

flight only from a liquid runway.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#57:1> A frightened loon will not fly, it will dive. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#58:1> And to good avail: a loon can slip beneath the surface of a

large, quiet lake on a clear day and disappear forever.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#59:1> How does it do it?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#60:1> At some indeterminable distance and direction, the escaping loon

raises just its bill above the surface, grabs a quick breath, and

resubmerges, leaving not a ripple.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#61:1> I saw it once, by luck, through my cheap Sears 7 x 35 extrawide-angle

field glasses.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#62:1> A series of these fast-snorkeled breaths allows a loon to put

kilometres between itself and the dumbfounded human observer. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#63:1> More alluring than its physical beauty is the cry of the loon,

lorn and lonely, reaching you as you stand on shore under a wine-coloured

sky, feel <l> ing much the same.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#64:1> A single wail at first.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#65:1> Then another, followed by yet others, excitement growing, blending

into a chorus of laughter and shrieking until the night is redundant with an

<l> cient emotion. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#66:1> Acoustic biologists have identified four distinctly meaningful

calls: the hoot ( a quiet contact call uttered among individuals close

together), the wail ( <quote> " Where <}> <-> aaare </-> <+> are </+> </}>

you? ... Come <}> <-> heeere </-> <+> here </+> </}> " </quote> ) , the

tremolo ( a quavering cry signifying alarm), and the yodel ( most radically

insane of all, given by males to establish territory or express extreme

alarm, as when a chick is threatened). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#67:1> In native legends across Canada, the loon's calls forewarned of

storms or pre <l> saged the resurrection of a human soul.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#68:1> They were calls between lovers, for the return of a companion, of joy

at being awarded those lovely necklaces in re <l> turn for restoring sight to

a blind human.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#69:1> Ojibwa warriors heard promise of victory.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#70:1> Cree heard the voices of their dead.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#71:1> Our cold-hearted behavioural sci <l> entists postulate that the wild

nighttime choruses are a func <l> tion of territorial behaviour.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#72:1> Perhaps so.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#73:1> But why not consider deeper emotions?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#74:1> Joy?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#75:1> Celebration?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#76:1> Camaraderie? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#77:1> Through the season, I drop in on the Little Magalloway Pair,

watching for the sequence of behaviours typical of nesting loons.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#78:1> Shortly after ice-out, the male arrives to es <l> tablish the

territory with song and dance.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#79:1> Then the female comes, and the two remain on the lake, often close

together, after the migrants pass through.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#80:1> In late May or early June, you begin to notice only one bird at a

time.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#81:1> If you are lucky, you may hear a solitary wail and see a second bird

arrive just before the first disappears to take its shift at incubation. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#82:1> But I do not see this sequence with the Little Magal <l> loway

Pair.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#83:1> Instead, I observe two birds - when I see them at all - out on the

water together.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#84:1> No hint of incubation. <O> picture </O> <O> In an endearing tableau,

young loon chicks nestle in the feathers of their parent's back, enjoying

great warmth and keeping a safe distance from aquatic predators such as

snapping turtle and northern pike </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#85:1> No nest, no eggs at any of their traditional nesting sites.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#86:1> I've seen it before.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#87:1> Even the most productive pairs take a year off from family

responsibilities once in a while, primarily to aggravate the local loon

biologist. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#88:1> In early September, I am showing off my study area to a loon

biologist from Alaska, attempting to appear proficient at my trade.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#89:1> When we reach the Little Magalloway ter <l> ritory, I explain that

this pair has failed to nest this year.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#90:1> <quote> " That's odd," </quote> says my companion, peering through

her binoculars. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#X91:1> <quote> " They have a chick with them." </quote> </X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#92:1> I take a look.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#93:1> They've lied to me again. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#94:1> This was all two years ago, and I never did find the nest.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#95:1> Not that I needed to.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#96:1> As my Alaskan friend pointed out, a chick is a fairly strong

indication that an egg had been laid.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#97:1> Nor did I mind the subterfuge.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#98:1> I had studied loons for only 16 years at the time.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#99:1> Had a lot to learn.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#100:1> Still do.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#101:1> No one knows, for example, which loons occupy which por <l> tions of

their broad winter range, whether young adults re <l> turn to their natal

areas, why some lakes that offer appar <l> ently good loon habitat remain

vacant, or how many chicks a loon pair must raise in a lifetime in order to

balance at <l> trition.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#102:1> For decades, we believed that loon pairs fiercely maintained

fidelity toward both mate and territory.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#103:1> Then a young biologist, Dave Evers, working out of Whitefish Point

Bird Observatory on Lake Superior, fashioned a tech <l> nique for catching

loons to colour-band them so that in <l> dividuals could be recognized.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#104:1> Early results indicate that at least one-fifth of his banded birds

switch mates or sneak onto other territories each year.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#105:1> One wonders what else re <l> mains veiled in the loon's mystique.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#106:1> The common loon may live to be 25 or 30 years old.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#107:1> Typ <l> ical of long-lived birds, the loon lays a small clutch -

nearly always two eggs - and gives its young full care through the summer.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#108:1> Both mates participate in everything but egg lay <l> ing.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#109:1> A loon may ride the young on its back or disappear with them after

hatching.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#110:1> But the mystical nature of this creature does not always work in its

favour.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#111:1> Loons will dance and sing in the summer twilight, year after year,

informing the night and our dreams with their presence while never re <l>

vealing a chronic failure in repro <l> duction.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#112:1> Until one spring, in their absence, there reigns an empty and

terrible silence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#113:1> Is it possible that the common loon, this stable creature with

60 million years of evolutionary fine-tuning, signature voice and spirit of

Canada's wilds, symbol of this vast and haunting land that the entire

continent once thought was inviolable, is disappearing from its haunts? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#114:1> By 1981, the southern Ontario country once described as <quote> "

a vast uninhabited solitude" </quote> by 19th-century naturalist Charles

Fathergill had suffered enough human habits and habitation to turn away its

native loon population.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#115:1> This prompted the Long Point Bird Observatory in Port Rowan to form

its Ontario Lakes Loon Survey, later to become the nationwide Canadian Lakes

Loon Survey, now under the di <l> rection of biologist Harry Vogel and

empowered by 3,500 volunteers from Nova Scotia to the Yukon.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#116:1> The survey records the presence and breeding success of loons from

<w> vol <l> unteers' </w> reports and provides information to the public.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#117:1> I asked Vogel about the status of the loon in Ontario.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#118:1> The southern edge of its breeding range is still receding, he told

me.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#119:1> Why?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#120:1> Well, he said, human behavior. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#121:1> Not the mere presence of humans but the behaviour of our modern

monoculture - the incredible busy-ness we in <l> flict upon our public

waters.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#122:1> Not only is loon habitat lost to shoreline development, but nesting

sites are disturbed - by berry pickers, picnickers, part-time naturalists,

canoeists and rowboaters, clandestine lovers, anglers, and campers - fre <l>

quently enough to frighten the loons off their clutch of eggs and dissuade

them from returning.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-026#123:1> Similar human blunders separate adult loons from their chicks,

leaving the little ones susceptible to predation or eventual starvation. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-026#124:1> Dieter Schoenfeld is a charter volunteer member of the Loon

Survey who with his wife, Marlies, monitors loon populations and reproduction

on 10 lakes in the Sudbury area, including McFarlane, on which they live.
