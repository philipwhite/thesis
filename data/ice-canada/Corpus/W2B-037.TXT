<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#1:1> <h> RCMP using new technology to pull fingerprints from plastic </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#2:1> Detecting fingerprints on plastic bags crammed with illegal drugs

has been about as easy as getting a crime lord to declare the source of his

income to the tax man. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#3:1> But innovative technology using fumes from super-strength glues in

a vacuum chamber is giving Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigators clear

fingerprints from plastic sandwich bags and other materials that normally

yield little evidence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#4:1> Developed by a scientist at the National Research Council in

Ottawa, the technique produces quality prints faster than methods usually

used by police.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#5:1> And it is also safer. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#6:1> RCMP Inspector Richard Shaddick, head of the <w> Mounties' </w>

science and technology branch in Ottawa, says prints don't stick well to

plastic bags, bottles or porous materials. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#7:1> Methods including dusting will continue to be used by

investigators, but the vacuum-chamber method is providing an important new

tool in crime fighting. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#8:1> Fumes emitted by cyanoacrylate, the active ingredient in the extra

strength glue, have been used for more than a decade to detect fingerprints.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#9:1> But the material has to be heated to produce the vapors that enhance

the ridges on prints. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#10:1> That process requires bulky equipment, often produces imperfect

prints and increases exposure to noxious fumes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#11:1> About a year ago, John Watkin, a scientist on contract to the

NRC, experimented by using a vacuum chamber to lower the atmospheric pressure

so the cyanoacrylate boils and vaporizes at room temperature. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#12:1> This method, says John Arnold, Watkin's supervisor and manager of

the NRC public-security program, produces superior fingerprints. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#13:1> The development is the first for the Canadian Police Research

Centre, an Ottawa-based joint venture of the NRC, RCMP and the Canadian

Association of Chiefs of Police. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#14:1> The cylindrical vacuum chamber is about five feet long and one

foot in diameter - large enough to hold dozens of plastic bags or a weapon as

big as a 12-gauge shotgun. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#15:1> When fingerprints are exposed to the cyanoacrylate vapor, a

polymer coats the ridges.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#16:1> The item bearing the prints is then removed from the chamber and

dipped into a fluorescent dye solution. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#17:1> Prints are then viewed under a portable fingerprint lamp, also

developed for the NRC by Watkin.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#18:1> Under the Luma-Lite, the prints show up as a brilliant yellow on a

black background. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#19:1> Arnold says 10 print units are being shipped to RCMP

field-identification centres across Canada for testing.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#20:1> One has been used since November at the RCMP forensic identification

laboratory in Ottawa. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#21:1> Arnold said the units cost about &dollar;50,000 to develop and

could sell for &dollar;10,000 to &dollar;20,000 each.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#22:1> He said the NRC is interested in licensing the technology to

companies that will manufacture and market them. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#23:2> <h> Danish firm testing new system to cut acid rain-producing gases

</h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#24:2> A less costly way of cleaning up acid rain-producing gases

emitted by power stations and other industrial systems will be tested in the

U.S. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#25:2> Danish firm FLS Miljo will install its gas-treating system at a

Kentucky plant for a test that will begin next year. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#26:2> FLS Miljo is a subsidiary of the Danish company FLS Industries -

world's largest maker of cement-production equipment - and a leading maker of

cement kilns and industrial hardware. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#27:2> Miljo has been diversifying into environmental control systems,

including equipment to remove sulphur dioxide gas pollution. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#28:2> As part of Miljo's strategy to produce new clean-up equipment for

industrial gases, an experimental system is to be installed next year at a

power station in Shawnee, Ky., a test plant run by the Tennessee Valley

Authority. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#29:2> If the Danish equipment operates as planned, it could be scaled

up to provide equipment for large-scale power stations. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#30:2> The U.S. Department of Energy is paying for the

US&dollar;4-million ( C&dollar;4.7 million) filtering system at Shawnee. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#31:2> Removing acid gases from industrial equipment is crucial to

reducing acid rain and other pollution.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#32:2> It is generally accomplished by scrubber systems that pass flue gases

through a water-based slurry of lime.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#33:2> The process turns sulphur dioxide gas into solid calcium sulphate.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#34:2> The new system from Miljo uses the same principles as traditional

scrubbers developed by several companies, including Mitsubishi of Japan and

Sweden's Flakt, part of Asea Brown Boveri. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#35:2> Like conventional systems, the FLS hardware uses lime - a mixture

of water with calcium oxide or calcium carbonate - to react with the gases.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#36:2> But Miljo's system reduces the size and expense of the process by

changing the design of the chamber in which the chemical reaction takes

place. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#37:2> Lime is directed at the gas stream as it moves up a vertical

column.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#38:2> Conventional scrubbing systems spray lime using a massive chamber in

which the gases move horizontally. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#39:2> The Miljo design ensures that the gases stay in contact with the

calcium oxide longer.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#40:2> It also recycles some of the lime. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#41:2> The equipment includes hardware to filter out ash and dust.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#42:2> It recirculates some of this material along with the lime, which aids

the chemical reaction by reducing the acid content of the flue gas. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#43:2> The overall impact of the new design, says Erik

Hoffmann-Petersen, Miljo president, is to reduce the size of the complete

system. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#44:2> That means a Miljo system can be installed for two thirds of the

price of a traditional scrubber. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#45:2> Hoffmann-Petersen says Miljo's gas-removal system could be

adapted for use by operational power stations and would cost US&dollar;10

million to US&dollar;20 million. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#46:2> Versions of the clean-up equipment that will be installed in the

U.S. already are being used at six Danish municipal incinerators. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#47:2> The systems are relatively cheap and remove sulphur dioxide and

other gases from the waste streams of these plants. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#48:2> The importance of the Kentucky project for Miljo is that it could

provide a big break in the large North American market for acid gas removal

equipment.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#49:2> Miljo already derives 25% of its revenues from the U.S. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#50:2> As part of efforts to expand operations in the U.S., Miljo

recently bought Airpol, a small environmental-control company based in New

Jersey. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#51:2> Besides new acid-gas clean-up hardware, Miljo sells conventional

scrubbing equipment that is based on Mitsubishi's design.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#52:2> Miljo also sells electrostatic precipitators - systems that remove

dust and other particles from large industrial plants such as cement works

<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#53:3> <h> New software helps treat bone disorders </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#54:3> People come in all shapes and sizes.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#55:3> Some reach their adult height when they're 12 years old, while others

don't spurt up until they're 15 or more. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#56:3> People with the same chronological age can have markedly

different bone ages.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#57:3> Accurately assessing someone's bone age is critical in treating

growth abnormalities or skeletal deformities, such as scoliosis, that require

hormone treatment or surgery, says University of Calgary medical researcher

Stuart Coupland. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#58:3> <h> UNEVEN GROWTH RATES </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#59:3> He gives an example of a 14-year-old whose left leg is growing

faster than the right.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#60:3> An orthopedic surgeon needs to assess how much more growth remains in

the normal leg to determine how big a piece of bone to cut out of the

abnormal leg to ensure they'll both end up roughly the same length. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#61:3> Coupland, a neural physiologist who dabbles in computer

programming in his spare time, has developed a software program that improves

on the speed and accuracy of methods currently used to assess bone age. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#62:3> The method favored by radiologists compares an X-ray of a hand

with a compilation of X-rays of hands of known age.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#63:3> It takes about five minutes, but is only accurate within a two-year

period.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#64:3> What's more, it indicates the age of a person's hand bones, which can

vary significantly from the bone age of the same person's leg or hip, says

Coupland. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#65:3> A second method, called RWT after the three researchers who

devised it 15 years ago, uses 37 measurements of the knee-joint to assess

bone age of the lower extremities.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#66:3> Though accurate to within six months, it takes an hour or more to

complete the assessment. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#67:3> Using a Microsoft Quick Basic language program and a MacIntosh II

workstation, Coupland has computerized the RWT method to get an answer in

less than 10 minutes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#68:3> " We had to make the RWT method practical in a clinical setting

without losing the accuracy," says Coupland.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#69:3> <X> " Orthopedic surgeons say they are happy with accuracy within six

months. When it's one or two years off, they're concerned." </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#70:3> Coupland used a video digitizer to transfer X-rays of knee joints

on to a computer screen.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#71:3> Based on the patient's gender and age, the computer decides how many

of the 37 measurements of the joint have to be taken to calculate the correct

bone age. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#72:3> The program, called COMRAD, for Computerized Radiographic Age

Diagnosis, leads the user through the steps to take the measurements off the

screen and calculates the bone age. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#73:3> Coupland is enhancing the program to allow users to save the

picture and measurements, probably on an optical disk, for future use.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#74:3> He has applied the same technology to measure abnormalities in facial

and head bones.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#75:3> These craniofacial distortions, which are caused by genetic

syndromes, are often diagnosed visually making treatment less exact, he says.

</p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#76:3> <h> TESTING IN CALGARY </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#77:3> COMRAD is being marketed by University Technologies International

Inc., a technology transfer company, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of

the university.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#78:3> UTI marketing manager Kathy Chan said COMRAD is being tested at a

Calgary hospital and plans are under way for tests in the Toronto area. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#79:3> Coupland holds the Canadian copyright for COMRAD and has applied

for U.S. copyright.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#80:3> Any profit he makes is split with the university, which funds UTI.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#81:3> He hopes to sell the software to various hospital radiology

departments and research labs.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#82:3> UTI is doing a survey to determine the appropriate market and pricing

for the product. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#83:4> <h> Canadian firm has global vision for robot vacuum cleaner's launch

</h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#84:4> Cyberworks Inc., the tiny Canadian company causing a stir with a

revolutionary robot for the contract cleaning industry, is pursuing, after

just one sale, European and North American markets. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#85:4> " By the end of the summer we're hoping to get Europe launched

and then North America by the end of the year," Vivek Burhan Parkar, the

26-year-old founder and president of the Orillia, <}> <-> Ont. </-> <+>

Ontario </+> </}> firm, said in an interview here. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#86:4> <h> 300 UNITS SOLD </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#87:4> <w> Cyberworks' </w> first customer is Hudon Groep Internationale

of the Netherlands, one of Europe's largest service contractors. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#88:4> Hudon, a wholly owned subsidiary of Vendex International NV, has

bought 300 Cyberworks robot vacuum cleaners for &dollar;6 million. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#89:4> Burhan Parkar says the robot machines have a unique market

advantage: " It's the first machine capable of working entirely on its own,

without human programming or instruction." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#90:4> The robot weighs about 180 kilograms - mostly batteries - and

uses a sophisticated electronic vision system and artificial intelligence.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#91:4> They are also cost effective at &dollar;20,000 each compared with

up to almost eight times that amount for competing models that require

constant programming, Burhan Parkar says. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#92:4> <X> " We have a tremendous strategic and technological lead.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#X93:4> That positions us as a world leader." </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#94:4> " It's a revolution in the cleaning industry," says Cees

Ravesteyn, vice-president of marketing and development for Hudon, which made

contact with Cyberworks by chance at a demonstration in Cologne, West

Germany. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#95:4> Hudon is now using eight of the robots in the Netherlands,

Belgium and France and expects to expand by the end of the summer. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#96:4> <h> 'CONSERVATIVE' FASHION </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#97:4> Studies of market potential in Europe indicate that Cyberworks

could sell at least 5,000 units a year, Ravesteyn said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#98:4> While Burhan Parkar talks confidently about penetrating major

markets in North America and Europe, he said Cyberworks plans to proceed in "

typically Canadian, conservative fashion." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#99:4> Burhan Parkar says he calculates it will take a minimum of two

years for any competition to catch up. </p> </I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-037#100:5> Although virtual reality is in the development stages, a

California company named VPL Research Inc. has already begun selling headgear

called an " eyephone" and a lightweight, sensor-equipped glove that would

allow a user to experience the sensation of picking up and moving objects

that appear in a virtual-reality environment.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#101:5> David Benman, VPL's sales-support engineer, said that the eyephone,

which also resembles a scuba mask, sells for &dollar;11,200, while the glove

costs &dollar;10,500.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#102:5> A complete package, which includes the eyephone, glove and two

computers manufactured by Silicon Graphics Computer Systems of Newport Beach,

<ICE-CAN:W2B-037#103:5> Benman said that VPL has sold its eyephone and glove to most of the

U.S. research institutes and universities that are currently conducting

virtual-reality research. <O> rest of paragraph </O> </p> </I>
