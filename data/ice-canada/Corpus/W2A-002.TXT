<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-002#2:1> Another difficult argument for the conscriptionists was their

linkage of compulsory military training with a " peaceful" Britain.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#3:1> " Peacefulness" could be interpreted as a promise to protect Britain

from the disruptive perils of invasion.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#4:1> However, the conscriptionist appeal for a peaceful Britain was also

based on a rejection of the accusations of militarism and antidemocratic

tendencies levelled against them by their opponents.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#5:1> It is this second definition and the problems which it gave the

conscriptionist cause which concern this essay. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-002#6:1> Just as their critics tried to argue that conscription and

economic prosperity did not match, opponents of the conscription movement

were quick to equate the scheme with militarism and a break with democratic,

peaceful British traditions.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#7:1> In his book, <it> The Great Illusion </it> , Norman Angell asked

poignantly, <X> <quote> " Do we not run some danger that with this mania for

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-002#8:1> The conscriptionists were extremely sensitive to such accusations.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#9:1> Lord Roberts was always certain to show that the conscriptionists did

not wish to make any violent departure from the traditional English respect

for democracy.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#10:1> In his 1911 book, <it> Fallacies and Facts: An Answer to <quote> "

Compulsory Service" </quote> </it> , Roberts admitted that his critics saw

compulsory military service as neither constitutional nor English.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#11:1> To them, it was <quote> " an act of violence, an unjust imposition of

blood enforced by our seniors on the young men of this country." </quote>

<sp> 107 </sp> <footnote> 107 Roberts, <it> Facts </it> , p.207. </footnote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#12:1> Roberts felt that such fears were unwarranted.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#13:1> Conscription would be the voluntary act of the nation and be undoable

by the will of the nation, if it so desired.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#14:1> Consequently, it would be of an <quote> " ethically and politically"

</quote> different character from the system prevailing in Germany or Russia.

<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#15:1> In his 1913 collection, <it> Campaign Speeches </it> , Lord Roberts

added that a British scheme of compulsory service would differ from those of

France, Austria, Italy, and Spain as well as those of Germany or Russia. <sp>

109 </sp> <footnote> 109 Roberts stressed that while continental countries

with conscription required an uninterrupted period of two years of military

service in camp or barracks, British requirements would be considerably less

onerous.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#16:1> The National Service League scheme would only require a few months of

training in the first year and a few weeks in the second and third to learn

the basics of discipline, drill and musketry.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#17:1> Such a <quote> " citizen army" </quote> would only be used for home

imposed against the will of the working class.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#21:1> One of Lord Roberts's fondest phrases was that the ballot box had

transformed the working classes into the new ruling class, thus making

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-002#25:1> The conscription movement also went to great lengths to redefine

voluntarism and conscription.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#26:1> Examples of <quote> " peaceful" </quote> countries who had adopted

conscription were also used with varying levels of effectiveness.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#27:1> Some conscriptionists came up with unique redefinitions of compulsory

and voluntary armies to fit their needs.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#28:1> In his 1907 pamphlet, <it> National and Non-National Armies </it> ,

J. Ellis Barker argued that national armies were <quote> " composed of the

<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#30:1> According to Barker, when compulsory service was <quote> " cheerfully

Barker argued that the Russians had <quote> " a non-National Army of the

compulsory type," </quote> Barker, p. 7. </footnote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#32:1> Unlike the Field Marshal, he squarely placed Germany at the forefront

of countries with <quote> " national armies" </quote> he admired while

dismissing the accomplishments of Britain's own voluntary army. <sp> 119

</sp> 119 <footnote> 119 In fact, Barker went as far as arguing that

Britain's voluntary system was responsible for the loss of the American

colonies and unnecessarily prolonged the war against Napoleon.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#33:1> In addition, he maintains that <quote> " National" </quote> armies

raised by conscription are always morally superior to all others.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#34:1> Thus, the invading Prussians in 1870 held <quote> " superior moral

force" </quote> over the degenerate French whose army had allowed

replacements or substitutes for those who could afford the 2,400 franc cost.

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-002#35:1> When searching for foreign examples which presented both a

constitutional and democratic version of compulsory service, conscriptionists

often gazed towards Switzerland.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#36:1> The Swiss system of a compulsory militia preserved personal liberties

while simultaneously maintaining industrial productivity. <sp> 120 </sp>

<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#37:1> Better yet, it required no permanent army; only a well structured

reserves system. <sp> 121 </sp> <footnote> 121 The Swiss system was somewhat

complicated but extremely complete.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#38:1> Military education was to start at age eight in the primary schools

with drill and other elementary exercises.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#39:1> Secondary schools would include training in the use of light

firearms.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#40:1> At the age of nineteen, citizens would join the ranks of recruits for

four to seven weeks and the subsequent year a similar amount of training

would be required in the corps of his canton.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#41:1> From age twenty through forty-four, the trained citizen would serve

in the Elite, the Reserve, and the Landwehr respectively, all of which

required an annual exercise of a fortnight or less. Caimes, pp. 237-39.

</footnote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#42:1> The example of the Swiss system held an especially powerful appeal

immediately after the Boer War.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#43:1> George Shee presented the idea of a compulsory militia in his seminal

book, <it> The Briton's First Duty </it> . <sp> 122 </sp> <footnote> 122 Shee

proposed compulsory service for one year in a militia between ages eighteen

and twenty-three.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#44:1> After this initial training, all trained citizens would be divided

into three sections resembling the Swiss system from ages eighteen to forty,

each section devoting a certain period every year to military training. Shee,

<it> Duty </it> , pp. 176-77. </footnote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#45:1> His argument was echoed by such league supporters as George Coulton.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#46:1> Coulton saw Switzerland as an excellent example of compulsory service

without militarism.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#47:1> In his 1900 pamphlet, <it> A Strong Army in a Free State: A Study of

the Old English and Modern Swiss Militias </it> , he praised the Swiss system

Coulton, p. 33. </footnote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#49:1> The non-militaristic example of conscription in Switzerland was

Coulton, <it> True Liberalism </it> , pp. 27-28. </footnote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#50:1> Coulton's words were confirmed by Lord Newton, one of the founding

members of the National Service League.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#51:1> In his memoirs, he recalls leading a British delegation to attend the

Swiss manoeuvers of August 1907.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#52:1> He stressed that only the military instructors of the Swiss army were

professional soldiers.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#53:1> Newton pointed out that the Swiss considered military service as

<quote> " temporary soldiers" </quote> to be a privilege and exemption a

disgrace.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#54:1> The men took to <quote> " hard work" </quote> cheerfully and had

<quote> " remarkable" </quote> general intelligence and sobriety.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#55:1> Such qualities were also evident in the higher ranks.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#56:1> Newton described the businessmen officers of the Swiss militia as

<quote> " modest, keen and highly educated." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#57:1> In the eyes of Lord Newton and others, Switzerland seemed to be a

democratic paradise backed by a strong national militia.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#58:1> With this in mind, it is not surprising that British conscriptionists

were certain to paint idyllic pictures of the Swiss militia system whenever

possible. <sp> 126 </sp> <footnote> 126 Newton, p. 159; A.G. Rickards,

Switzerland to the outer reaches of the empire for inspiration.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#60:1> In a speech delivered in Bristol on 13 February 1913, Lord Roberts

referred to the schemes of universal military training in Australia, New

Zealand, and South Africa as proof that British political traditions and

conscription were not mutually exclusive.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#61:1> He challenged his listeners to prove that such policies had made any

of these dominions <quote> " bellicose and aggressive." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#62:1> Australia held a particular fascination for conscriptionists as its

scheme of military training was imposed by a Labour government.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#63:1> This fact seemed sufficient to Lord Roberts to rebut charges that

<quote> " civilian armies" </quote> would ever be used to put down strikes.

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-002#65:1> Some conscriptionists preferred to look to the British past for

precedents.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#66:1> George Coulton, a medieval historian and conscriptionist, was the

leading user of historical examples in support of the movement's goals.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#67:1> In his booklet, <it> A Strong Army in a Free State </it> , he

presented the example of medieval England as a military power with

conscription.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#68:1> According to Coulton, the fourteenth-century army of Edward III was

<quote> " trained by the completest system of compulsory service organized by

<footnote> 128 Coulton, p. 8. </footnote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#69:1> Coulton elaborated his point by arguing that all British citizens

were liable to serve under this medieval scheme according to their personal

means.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#70:1> He compared the medieval requirement for compulsory archery as a

holiday sport with the inadequate training in shooting given to regular

soldiers in the early twentieth century. <sp> 129 </sp> <footnote> 129

Coulton, p. 9. </footnote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-002#71:1> It is interesting to note that few other conscriptionists reached

back into the mists of British history.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#72:1> As previously mentioned, Roberts had harked back to the victories won

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-002#101:1> That being said, it is equally important to note that such views

were definitely in the minority.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#102:1> A majority of both Socialists and British citizens were sufficiently

opposed to compulsory military service that it remained an impossible dream

for Britain in peacetime.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#103:1> It was not until the midst of the First World War in January 1916

that the government felt secure enough to introduce legislation to make some

form of limited conscription a reality.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#104:1> It should also be noted that as a popular slogan <quote> "

peacefulness" </quote> could only go so far in selling conscription.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#105:1> The best popular response came by appealing to public fears over

invasion.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#106:1> When such appeals were made, peacefulness faded far into the

background. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-002#108:1> The conscription movement was not one for ideological

sophisticates.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#109:1> Lord Roberts and his followers tried earnestly to convert British

opinion to the need for conscription but were usually outclassed by their

more agile opponents. <sp> 139 </sp> <footnote> 139 In his book, <it> Ordeal

by Battle </it> ( London, 1915), F.S. Oliver pointed to the limitation of

Roberts's debating skills. He admitted that Roberts's highest intellectual

quality was his <quote> " instinct" </quote> and that he was <quote> " a poor

arguer." </quote> However, Roberts <quote> " had the gift of stating his

conclusion with admirable lucidity." </quote> Unfortunately, his conclusions

like the reasons he provided in support of them <quote> " were in the nature

of statements; they were not stages in an argument." </quote> As quoted in

James, pp.489-90 </footnote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#110:1> Faced with such difficulties, the temptation existed to appeal to

the public's base fears about invasion.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#111:1> The fear of invasion was indisputably the trump card of the

conscription movement.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#112:1> Although conscriptionists tried to tie their scheme to notions of

health, prosperity, and <quote> " peacefulness," </quote> their strongest

public response came from graphically portraying the threat that invasion

represented. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-002#113:1> The National Service League supported books like William Le

Queux's <it> Invasion of 1910 </it> ( 1906) and even sponsored their own

play, B.S. Townroe's <it> A Nation in Arms </it> ( 1990). <sp> 140 </sp>

<footnote> 140 For a discussion of Le Queux see stafford, <quote> "

Conspiracy and Xenophobia." </quote> For invasion plays see Hynes, <it> The

Edwardian Turn of Mind. </it> For a discussion comparing Townroe's play with

its rivals see Matthew Hendley, " The Conscription Movement in Great Britain

1899-1914," unpublished M.A. thesis ( McGill University, 1991), pp.102-4.

</footnote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#114:1> Invasion could be seen as an immediate threat and compulsory

military training could be presented as simply the most effective form of

home defence.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#115:1> Such straightforward arguments reached their peak between 1908-9 and

retained some force until 1914 though complicated by the presence of a new

voluntary home defence unit - the Territorial Force. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-002#116:1> Although the conscriptionists relied heavily on invasion

rhetoric, especially in their later years, it is necessary to go beyond this

well-known side to the movement.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#117:1> Conscriptionists had other arguments.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#118:1> The important point is that they tried to use them at all.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-002#119:1> It is only by assessing the full scope of arguments of the

conscription movement that its place in Edwardian Britain can be full

appreciated and evaluated. </p> </I>
