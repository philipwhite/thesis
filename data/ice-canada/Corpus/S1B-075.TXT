<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#1:1:B> All right <,> this is a ski from Rossignol

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#2:1:A> Ya <,>

<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#4:1:B> It's an advanced ski
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#5:1:B> It's <unclear> word </unclear> advanced
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#6:1:B> It's intermediate
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#7:1:B> Excuse me <O> cough </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#8:1:A> Advanced

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#9:1:B> It's for the advanced intermediate skier

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#10:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#11:1:B> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#12:1:B> The uh <?> S P S </?> it's called <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=>

</}> sport ski
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#13:1:B> What it is is basically an <?> E Two </?> version of <}> <-> their

</-> <=> uh their uh </=> </}> ski <unclear> word </unclear> called the Four

S
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#14:1:B> The Four S came out in eighty-eight
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#15:1:B> So uh it won many many Olympic medals

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#16:1:A> <{> <[> Okay </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#17:1:B> <[> It's </[> </{> very highly regarded a good performance ski

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#20:1:B> <}> <-> It's a </-> <=> it's a </=> </}> very snappy ski

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#21:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#22:1:B> Uhm <,,> do you want to see here
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#23:1:B> Do you want to hold that
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#24:1:B> It's very <{> <[> light </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#25:1:A> <[> Ya </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#26:1:B> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#27:1:B> It's light

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#28:1:A> <{> <[> Alright </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#29:1:B> <[> <unclear> maybe two word </unclear> </[> </{> <?> tonnes

</?> of flexibility
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#30:1:B> Okay

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#31:1:A> Mm hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#32:1:B> What type of skiing do you like to do
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#33:1:B> <}> <-> Do you like to do </-> <=> uh do you like to do </=> </}>

short radius turns or long radius turns
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#34:1:B> Do you like to ski moguls

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#35:1:A> Well I like to do moguls but I'm not that great at them but

I'm trying to do them like with shorter turns instead of <{1> <[1> making the

big loops </[1> around like I'm trying
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#36:1:A> <{2> <[2> to cut them </[2> you know

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#37:1:B> <[1> Mm hmm mm </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#38:1:B> <[2> Right right right </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#39:1:B> Mm hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#40:1:A> So

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#41:1:B> So <,> it seems to me as though you're looking for something

that's a pretty quick turning ski something snappy <{> <[> <,> </[> something

that's easily moveable

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#42:1:A> <[> Ya </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#43:1:A> Ya that's <{> <[> it </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#44:1:B> <[> Okay </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#45:1:B> Therefore when you're looking for something like that you're

looking for something <}> <-> that's </-> <=> uh <,> that's </=> </}> soft on

the shovel

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#46:1:B> Okay that's the front of the ski at the top
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#47:1:B> Okay

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#48:1:A> <{> <[> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#49:1:A> Ya
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#50:1:A> Oh ya that's <?> pretty flexible </?> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#51:1:B> <[> It flexes pretty easily </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#52:1:A> <{> <[> Ya </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#53:1:B> <[> So that </[> </{> way what happens is it's easy to

initiate <?> in </?> turn

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#54:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#55:1:B> It's easy to begin a turn <,> and <?> hold </?>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#56:1:B> And then what you want is something that's a little bit uh stiffer

<}> <-> in the </-> <=> in the </=> </}> tail <{1> <[1> <,> okay </[1> in the

back of the ski
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#57:1:B> <{2> <[2> <,,> </[2> something that's a little bit stiffer <}> <->

that way </-> <=> you know that way </=> </}> what happens is it whips you

out of your turns and it prepares you for your next turn

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#58:1:A> <[1> Right </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#59:1:A> <[2> Mm hmm </[2> </{2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#60:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#61:1:B> Okay usually that's generally the kind of <unclear> word

</unclear> ski you're going to look for <,,> <}> <-> for someone that's </->

<=> ah <,> for a skier who's </=> </}> looking <}> <-> for you know for to do

</-> <=> to do </=> </}> short radius turns

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#62:1:A> <{> <[> Mm </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#63:1:B> <[> But </[> </{> the reason for that is just that uh you know

it's easy to begin the turn it's easy to come out of it and <?> prepare the

</?> <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#64:1:B> And when you have somebody who's looking <}> <-> for </-> <=> <,> a

lot for </=> </}> a G S ski which also means giant slalom <,> they're making

bigger turns <,> generally they have <}> <-> more even flex so you </-> <=>

<}> <-> a more </-> <=> more </=> </}> of an even </=> </}> flex to the skier
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#65:1:B> <?> It slides </?>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#66:1:B> <}> <-> It's </-> <=> it's </=> </}> an equal flex and what that

does is when they're connecting their turns <,> they just go long and

smoothly
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#67:1:B> They don't have to <}> <-> <.> wo </.> </-> <=> worry </=> </}> <}>

<-> about their weight </-> <=> about the changing of their weight </=> </}>

so much

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#68:1:A> Okay <,,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#69:1:B> So <,> <}> <-> it's </-> <=> uh you know <}> <-> it's </-> <=>

it's </=> </}> </=> </}> quite something
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#70:1:B> <}> <-> It's it's </-> <=> it's </=> </}> <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#71:1:B> It's a great ski
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#72:1:B> It's super light
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#73:1:B> <unclear> word </unclear> too you're looking for something that's

<?> torsionally stiff </?>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#74:1:B> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#75:1:B> And this particular <unclear> word </unclear> okay <}> <-> is quite

</-> <=> it's quite </=> </}> <?> torsional </?>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#76:1:B> What that means is <{> <[> <}> <-> <.> bas </.> </-> <+> basically

</+> </}> </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#77:1:A> <[> <?> torsch </?> </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#78:1:A> What's the word

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#79:1:B> Torsion

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#80:1:A> <{> <[> Torsion </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#81:1:B> <[> Okay </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#82:1:B> One ski is torsionally
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#83:1:B> It's sort of ah <,,> <unclear> maybe two words </unclear> adding an

A L L Y to the end of the words
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#84:1:B> <unclear> most of a phrase </unclear> that torsionally is stiff
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#85:1:B> Okay <}> <-> that that </-> <=> that </=> </}> basically regulates

the amount of torque that you have in a ski <,> <}> <-> how much it </-> <=>

how much it </=> </}> rotates when you're carving your turn

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#86:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#87:1:B> And so what happens is a ski <}> <-> that's more </-> <=>

that's ah stiffer torsionally </=> </}> <{> <[> <,,> </[> means it's <}> <->

gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> hold better on ice

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#88:1:A> <[> Right </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#90:1:A> <{> <[> Right </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#91:1:B> <[> You know </[> </{> how the advanced skis <}> <-> are </->

<=> they generally tend to be </=> </}> more <?> stiffer torsional </?>

because they're applying more pressure on their ski <{> <[> and <}> <-> they

</[> </-> <=> they're </=> </}> using more of their leg and so what's

happening is they need something that's <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+>

the </-> <=> you know the weight </=> </}> that they put on their ski

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#92:1:A> <[> Mm hmm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#93:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#94:1:B> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#95:1:B> Therefore <,,> it's <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> hold

better
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#96:1:B> Okay and <}> <-> when you have a </-> <=> uh when you have </=>

</}> one of the <unclear> word </unclear> you know not as stiff torsionally

generally what tends to happen is that <}> <-> the </-> <=> uh the </=> </}>

ski does not hold as well on ice

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#97:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#98:1:B> And when you have a beginner's ski because they're not
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#99:1:B> <?> I'll tell you </?> what happens <}> <-> when they </-> <=> when

they </=> </}> make their turns is <}> <-> as they're turning </-> <=> as

they're turning </=> </}> <}> <-> they're not </-> <=> uhm <,> they're not

</=> </}> putting as much pressure on <,> they're not using the ski as much
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#100:1:B> That's generally what happens
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#101:1:B> And as they make the transition <}> <-> as they </-> <=> as their

</=> </}> skiing improves <{> <[> you know </[> <}> <-> they </-> <=> the

skier </=> </}> will make the turn from the tip of the ski all the way to the

end

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#102:1:A> <[> Ya </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#103:1:A> As opposed to just in a <{> <[> certain area </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#105:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#106:1:B> Generally what tends to happen is people <}> <-> tend to </->

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#108:1:B> Exactly
<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#109:1:B> <}> <-> That's <}> <-> <.> ten </.> </-> <+> tends </+> </}> </->

<=> that's generally </=> </}> what happens sometimes <}> <-> when you have

</-> <=> when you have </=> </}> ah a beginner skier

<unclear> word </unclear> a little more

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#113:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#114:1:B> And therefore this one is fairly torsion <unclear> word

</unclear> so it's going to hold pretty well on the ice

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-075#115:1:A> <{> <[> Ya </[>

<ICE-CAN:S1B-075#123:1:B> What happens is <}> <-> when you're uh when you're </-> <=> when
