<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#1:1:A> But <,> I thought <}> <-> it was kind of </-> <=> it gave it

</=> </}> a different flavour

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#2:1:B> What were the things that <,> were on display

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#3:1:A> Their work <,> from the year like uhm oh <,> gosh <,> <}> <->

from </-> <=> from </=> </}> paintings to mechanisms to maquettes to <,>

poetry on bark and like some of the uhm Japanese rice paper

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#4:1:B> <{> <[> Hmm </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#5:1:A> <[> Is it </[> </{> Chinese rice paper

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#6:1:B> <{> <[> Well that </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#7:1:A> <[> <unclear> word </unclear> </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#8:1:A> There was

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#9:1:B> I'm not sure if it's Japanese or Chinese <O> laugh </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#10:1:A> Maybe it's just
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#11:1:A> But <,> <{> <[> <?> just </?> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#12:1:B> <[> Chinese </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#13:1:B> Chinese cos theirs <,> ya <unclear> word </unclear> one with the

rice paddies

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#14:1:A> There's usually an innovative <,,> style to the projects
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#15:1:A> Like there's <}> <-> thought </-> <=> forethought </=> </}> and

there's <,> societal <,,> environmental impact and blah you know all these

sort of things
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#16:1:A> So they're interesting
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#17:1:A> <}> <-> They're not it's not they're not most they they're </-> <=>

they </=> </}> do exist <,> but it's not mostly <,> a piece of art that you

look at and go oh isn't that beautiful <{> <[> and </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#18:1:B> <}> <-> <[> Although </[> </{> </-> <=> Although </=> </}>

there's elements <,> probably in there that are <{> <[> <,,> </[> but usually

they cause you to stop and examine and study and think and discuss

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#19:1:A> <[> Mhh hmm </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#20:1:A> Mhh hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#21:1:B> And that's what's encouraged in the programs

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#22:1:A> Thought provoking <,,> objects

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#23:1:B> Mhh hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#24:1:A> Thought pieces

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#25:1:B> Ya

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#26:1:A> Interesting

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#27:1:B> Trying to teach our designers to have a conscience

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#28:1:A> Hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#29:1:B> <{> <[> Basically </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#30:1:A> <[> I'm glad </[> </{> to hear somebody's going to have a

conscience

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#31:1:B> Ya
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#32:1:B> Basically a designer affects <,> <}> <-> his environment </-> <=>

his or her environment </=> </}> and you have to be very careful on the

impact to society when you do that <,> and that's what we teach our <,,>

designers

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#33:1:A> So I can rest assured that if I hire a designer from Concordia

I know I'm getting one of the best right

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#34:1:B> The president of our Student Association called us up this

morning and uh <}> <-> they </-> <=> they've </=> </}> decided to do a logo

for the department
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#35:1:B> And they've also decided that they're going to put out caps
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#36:1:B> They're going to sell caps for
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#37:1:B> Cos this exhibit that they have at the year <&> no " end" </&> cost

them a fortune <{> <[> <,,> </[> like thousands and thousands of dollars

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#38:1:A> <[> Uh huh </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#39:1:B> And they're going to put out <,> caps to sell and even a line

of jackets
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#40:1:B> And <,> like they're really going to go all out <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#41:1:B> So I told the guy I said I want you to know I'm waiting for these

caps cos I want to buy one <{> <[> <O> laugh </O> I'm not going to buy any

</[> other cap

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#42:1:A> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#43:1:A> <}> <-> Have </-> <=> do you have </=> </}> a company <}> <-> that

</-> <=> uh that </=> </}> makes caps

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#44:1:B> I don't know <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#45:1:B> Why <,> do you know one in mind

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#46:1:A> Well there's uhh a fellow <}> <-> who </-> <=> uhm <,,> who

</=> </}> has a daughter <}> <-> at </-> <=> a </=> </}> child anyway at <@>

Greenvale </@> School <{> <[> and he </[> owns a company that makes caps

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#47:1:B> <[> Mh hmm </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#48:1:B> Mh hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#49:1:A> Yup
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#50:1:A> And uh he does a lot of caps
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#51:1:A> Well in fact <,> uhm one of our neighbours was telling us they went

down to P E I <&> Prince Edward Island: Canadian province </&> and they

bought a hat for their son and when they got back they just happened to

glance down <}> <-> at the </-> <=> uhm at the </=> </}> label and <O> laugh

</O> they realized it was <O> laugh </O> this <}> <-> fella </-> <+> fellow

</+> </}> who had made the hat
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#52:1:A> And apparently <}> <-> he </-> <=> he </=> </}> makes thousands and

thousands of hats for <}> <-> all </-> <=> all </=> </}> kinds of

organizations and whatnot

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#53:1:B> Uh huh

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#54:1:A> And uh <O> cough </O> we were talking about getting hats for

our school <,> at one point for a fundraiser and uh <,> <}> <-> they </-> <=>

people </=> </}> were coming up with various names and I said I think I have

a name I think so <&> knock at the door. An extracorpus speakers enters the

room and communicates ( by miming?) with speaker A </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#55:1:A> Come in
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#56:1:A> Hello <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#57:1:A> Pardon
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#58:1:A> Yes but you can speak
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#59:1:A> It's okay
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#60:1:A> You don't <{> <[> wish to speak </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#61:1:B> <[> <unclear> word </unclear> <?> alright </?> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#62:1:A> Okay <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#63:1:A> Yes please
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#64:1:A> <{> <[> Go ahead <O> laugh </O> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#65:1:B> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#66:1:A> Here you go <,,> <&> Sound of door shutting. Extracorpus

speaker leaves room. </&>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#67:1:A> We share
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#68:1:A> <O> laugh </O> We drank her water so she's going to eat up my salad

dressing
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#69:1:A> Anyway I believe that he donated uh like <}> <-> his </-> <=> <,>

his </=> </}> <,,> way of donating to the school was to offer his services
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#70:1:A> <}> <-> And </-> <=> and </=> </}> so whatever they sold <,> I

think they just paid for the materials basically
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#71:1:A> So he didn't make any money off of it <{> <[> <,,> </[> and

whatever they sold was their profit so

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#72:1:B> <[> Uh huh </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#73:1:B> Oh good

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#74:1:A> Uhm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#75:1:B> That's good
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#76:1:B> That's a very good <}> <-> <.> re </.> </-> <=> resource </=> </}>

to have <{> <[> <,,> </[> volunteered

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#77:1:A> <[> Mh hmm </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#78:1:A> Ya exactly
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#79:1:A> I know <,,> we were talking about him because <,,> <@> Anabelle

</@> when we were camping uhm uh
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#80:1:A> You know <@> Anabelle </@> is uhm the little girl who has alopecia
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#81:1:A> She has no hair

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#82:1:B> Ya ya

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#83:1:A> And she was <{> <[> playing soccer </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#84:1:B> <[> How is she doing </[> </{> by the way

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#85:1:A> Oh there's only a twenty percent chance that her hair will

ever grow back

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#86:1:B> How did they derive at that <,,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#87:1:A> At the twenty percent

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#88:1:B> <{> <[> Ya </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#89:1:A> <[> Uhm </[> </{> I think it's just on past experience with

patients that have <,> <{> <[> alopecia </[> totalis

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#90:1:B> <[> Mhh </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#91:1:A> Uhm there are other forms of alopecia where the alopecia comes

and goes <,> but because she's lost all her body <{> <[> hair </[> uhm uh <}>

<-> they </-> <=> she </=> </}> has been declared as alopecia totalis and

only twenty percent of the cases have actually <,> grown back hair

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#92:1:B> <[> So </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#93:1:A> And sometimes only <,> for only ah a very short period of time

and then they lose it again
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#94:1:A> So in a way I'm hoping that if she does grow back hair <}> <-> that

she </-> <=> that <}> <-> it it </-> <=> <{1> <[1> <,,> </[1> it </=> </}>

</=> </}> grows back ya and in one fell swoop and that
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#95:1:A> <{2> <[2> she doesn't </[2> have partial
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#96:1:A> <{3> <[3> because </[3> that would be harder to deal with

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#97:1:B> <[1> Stays </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#98:1:B> <[2> Mhh hmm </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#99:1:B> <[3> Mhh </[3> </{3>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#100:1:B> Mhh

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#101:1:A> But uhm <,> things haven't changed much
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#102:1:A> So it's almost two years now <}> <-> that she's </-> <=> uh that

she's </=> </}> had it
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#103:1:A> Anyway it's quite a problem now because <,> she plays soccer
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#104:1:A> Uhm she plays on the inter-city team for uh the <@> Tetras </@>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#105:1:A> And uhm <,> there's a rule in inter-city soccer <.> wa </.> and I

think it probably applies as well <}> <-> to </-> <=> uhm to </=> </}> house

league soccer you're not allowed to wear a baseball cap <{1> <[1> <,,> </[1>

because the peak of the cap can be quite dangerous <}> <-> if
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#106:1:A> <{2> <[2> you're <,,> </[2> </-> <=> if you </=> </}> collide or

somebody can get it in the eye or something

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#107:1:B> <[1> Ohh </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#108:1:B> <[2> Oh ya </[2> </{2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#109:1:A> So apparently they've had <{> <[> accidents </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#110:1:B> <[> Can't she </[> </{> wear a tam though like

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#111:1:A> No she wouldn't wear a tam
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#112:1:A> Like <}> <-> you you also have to </-> <=> you also have to </=>

</}> realize that <,,> she's at an age now where <,> she's going to have her

own preferences
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#113:1:A> So <,> what she did last year was she wore bandanas <{> <[> <,,>

those </[> sort of western-looking bandanas

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#114:1:B> <[> Okay </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#115:1:B> And uhm <,> that was okay but uhm I think she still felt a bit

like a sore thumb and <,> so what happened was uhm the girl that used to

babysit her <,,> is quite a sewer <&> one who sews </&> and so she <,>

designed a little kerchief kind of thing
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#116:1:B> It's like a bandana but it's shaped in somewhat of a triangular

shape <,> uhm out of black fabric
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#117:1:B> Their colours are black and orange and yellow
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#118:1:B> So she came up with this black fabric and she designed this

triangular shape that would be easy for them to wear
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#119:1:B> And uh they took it to the company that does the uniforms and they

had the logo <{> <[> <,,> uh </[> put on the bandana in the front

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#120:1:B> <[> Ahh </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#121:1:A> And uhm they had two of them made
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#122:1:A> One for her <,,> and one for a friend <}> <-> who </-> <=> like

her </=> </}> friend who supports her
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#123:1:A> It happens to be the lady whose son it happens to be her daughter
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#124:1:A> Uhm she is a really big supporter and she feels that if she's

wearing one it's going to make the little girl with alopecia feel more

comfortable
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#125:1:A> And so the whole team wants them now <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#126:1:A> So <{> <[> uhm <,> ya </[> ya

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#127:1:B> <[> Oh neat ya </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#128:1:A> So <,> they went back and said they wanted more and the guy

came up with some outrageous figure of eighteen dollars per bandana
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#129:1:A> I said that's crazy
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#130:1:A> So I suggested to them that maybe they go and see this guy who

makes the caps and maybe he can do something <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#131:1:A> Cos <}> <-> he was </-> <=> he was </=> </}> trying different

designs last year <,> to come up with something for her but nothing that he

came up with <,> she felt comfortable with <,> but she really likes this

bandana
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#132:1:A> So they all look like pirates wearing them <}> <-> but </-> <=>

but </=> </}> <}> <-> if </-> <=> I </=> </}> don't know <,> it gives them

that kind of mean edge <{> <[> that I suppose you need <}> <-> as a </[> </->

<=> as a </=> </}> competitive sports player you know

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#133:1:B> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#134:1:A> But I said what a wonderful thing
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#135:1:A> The whole team decided that <,> they liked them <,> and they

wanted to wear them for her sake
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#136:1:A> And I think that <{> <[> really said something to the <?> kids

</?> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#137:1:B> <[> Uh <,,> that's wonderful </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#138:1:A> Ya

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#139:1:B> That's so heartwarming

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#140:1:A> Ya ya <{> <[> when </[> they told me that I said wow what a

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#141:1:B> <[> Ya </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#142:1:A> But they've been playing together for a number of years
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#143:1:A> She's been playing inter-city now for <,,> at least two years
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#144:1:A> This is probably her third year

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#151:1:A> She plays house league though

<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#158:1:B> Right

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#160:1:B> Right

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#161:1:A> And most of the games are at six six-thirty at night

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#172:1:B> <[> Ya </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#173:1:A> Uhm <{> <[> <,,> </[> <}> <-> you </-> <=> she </=> </}>

wouldn't be able to play <}> <-> on </-> <=> on </=> </}> the same team as

<@> Charlie </@> though

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#174:1:B> <[> I might do that </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#175:1:A> <@> Charlie </@> 's playing in a league that's beyond her age

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#176:1:A> Uhm she's supposed to be playing Atom <,> but we put her into

Mosquito
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#177:1:A> Uhm <@> Carley </@> would have to play Atom
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#178:1:A> Just <}> <-> <.> co </.> </-> <+> cos </+> </}> this is her fourth

year playing <{> <[> <,> and </[> some of the kids she'd be playing Atom with

I felt she would probably be really bored with them

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#179:1:B> <[> Mhh hmm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#180:1:A> So we decided to put her up into Mosquito
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#181:1:A> And the girls that she'll be playing with <}> <-> are </-> <=>

they </=> </}> were on her ringette team last winter

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#182:1:B> Mhh hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#183:1:A> So they have a fairly cohesive group

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#184:1:B> Mhh hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#185:1:A> <}> <-> And </-> <=> Uhm and </=> </}> <}> <-> they're all

<,,> pretty much </-> <=> they all <,> really </=> </}> understand the game
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#186:1:A> And I think <}> <-> if </-> <=> if </=> </}> you were to put

somebody in there that didn't know how to play <{> <[> I think they'd get a

little creamed you know </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#187:1:B> <[> Ohh <,,> right right </[> </{> right

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#188:1:A> So she'd be better off to go into Atom
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#189:1:A> And I can give you the <.> n </.> guy's name <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#190:1:A> Uhm <,,> <{> <[> <unclear> word </unclear> there's a couple people

</[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#191:1:B> <[> Is <@> Henry </@> too young </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#192:1:B> <{> <[> No </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#193:1:A> <[> <@> Henry </@> </[> </{> no <,> no no
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#194:1:A> <}> <-> <@> Henry </@> </-> <=> <@> Henry </@> </=> </}> is five

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#195:1:B> Five and a half
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#196:1:B> He's going to be <{> <[> six </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#197:1:A> <[> Ya </[> </{> he could play
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#198:1:A> He can play
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#199:1:A> No problem
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#200:1:A> <{> <[> They can both play </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#201:1:B> <[> Is it very expensive </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#202:1:A> <O> Inhale </O> When I registered I think it was sixty or

sixty-five
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#203:1:A> But then if
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#204:1:A> That was in February
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#205:1:A> If you late registered in March it was a little bit more

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#206:1:B> Mhh

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#207:1:A> So I would think it might be around seventy or seventy-five

<{> <[> dollars </[> is my guess <,,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#208:1:B> <[> Mhh hmm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#209:1:A> The fellow who runs it is <@> Arnaud <,> Le Jean </@>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#210:1:B> Mhh hmm <,,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#211:1:A> And that's his phone number

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#212:1:B> Do

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#213:1:A> There's also <@> Rob <,,> <w> Maur <,> ic <,> iano </w> </@>

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#214:1:A> And I'll get his number for you
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#215:1:A> He's probably the key person to speak with I would think
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#216:1:A> Uhm <,,> so they <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#217:1:A> Certainly <@> Carley </@> would be in uh <{> <[> Atom </[> <,> and

in terms of <@> Henry </@> <,,> <}> <-> I think he'd all </-> <=> I think

he'd </=> </}> be in Junior Atom

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#218:1:B> <[> Atom </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#219:1:B> Mhh hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#220:1:A> Uhm <,,> <{> <[> they </[> <,> were talking about an elite

team which was <,> <}> <-> an </-> <=> sort of like an </=> </}> inter-city

team <,> uhm at that age level and that's what they were thinking of putting

<@> Charlie </@> on but I said no I'm not interested in that because you have

to drive all over

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#221:1:B> <[> <unclear> word </unclear> </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#222:1:B> I know

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#223:1:A> <}> <-> You </-> <=> you </=> </}> know <}> <-> it's </-> <=>

it's </=> </}> too much it's too much
<ICE-CAN:S1A-090#224:1:A> So but certainly all the teams <}> <-> are forming </-> <=> have

already been formed </> </}>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#225:1:B> Yes

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-090#226:1:A> The teams have already been picked uhm but I spoke with with

<@> Rob </@> last week cos what happened was <,> for some reason they never

got her into the Mosquito <,> list so she wasn't on the draft </I>
