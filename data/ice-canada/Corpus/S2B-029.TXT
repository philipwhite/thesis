<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-029#1:1:A> The atmosphere itself is being altered by human activity
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#2:1:A> Acid rain has already <,> uh <}> <-> <.> des </.> </-> <=>

eliminated </=> </}> plants and animals in tens of thousands of lakes in

Canada and in Europe <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#3:1:A> Ozone depletion is occurring at faster than all projections indicate
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#4:1:A> Every report that we get <,> indicates a surprise because it's more

severe than expected <,> while greenhouse gases accumulate at ever greater

rates
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#5:1:A> Scientists do not and will not <,> ever know enough to predict the

consequences of such atmospheric change
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#6:1:A> But it is madness <,> to use that scientific ignorance <,> to

justify carrying on with business as usual
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#7:1:A> The thin layer of light coating the earth <,> is responsible for

cleansing and replenishing the air water and soil <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#8:1:A> Yet we are tearing it apart at the rate <,> of one acre a second
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#9:1:A> And with that destruction of our wilderness areas <,> go an

estimated fifty thousand species a year <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#10:1:A> Those are the facts <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#11:1:A> But you don't have to take my word for it <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#12:1:A> I keep getting people who say over and over I don't <}> <-> wanna

</-> <+> want to </+> </}> listen to you this is too depressing
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#13:1:A> Why should I listen to anything <,> you say
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#14:1:A> You're the doctor of doom and gloom <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#15:1:A> Well ladies and gentlemen I don't apologize for reciting that

litany <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#16:1:A> If one of my daughters got sick and I took her to the doctor and

the doctor told me <,> I'm sorry David your daughter is dying <,> surely to

goodness it would be <}> <-> irresponsil <.> b </.> </-> <=> irresponsible

</=> </}> of me <,> to say listen doc I've had a <.> t </.> hard day I don't

<}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> listen to all of this
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#17:1:A> The only responsible answer is to say I want you to tell me

everything there is to know <,> about her condition
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#18:1:A> And then we can get on with the business of saving her life
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#19:1:A> And I don't think that we can afford the luxury <,> of saying this

is too depressing I don't <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> face this
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#20:1:A> We have to confront the state of the world <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#21:1:A> And then get on with the business of doing what has to be done <,>

to try to <.> s </.> make it <,> ah <,> continue to be habitable
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#22:1:A> But you don't have to listen <&> tape cuts out very briefly </&>

what I say
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#23:1:A> You can verify it for yourself
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#24:1:A> There's a very simple way <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#25:1:A> Just ask your elders
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#26:1:A> Ask anyone who's seventy or eighty years old
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#27:1:A> What was the world like <,> when they were children <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#28:1:A> All around the world our elders are a living record of the enormous

changes taking place within the span of a single human life
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#29:1:A> And by simply projecting that change that has occurred during their

lives into the future <,> you know with absolute certainty <,> that our

grandchildren will have drastically reduced <,> opportunities and enormous

and unprecedented problems <,> that we have left them <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#30:1:A> Yet in response to ecological warnings <,> and the call for <,> the

need for radical change <,> we continue to hear denial <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#31:1:A> We continue to hear rationalization <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#32:1:A> We continue to be uh assaulted with expensive multinational

corporate <,> P R <,> with character assassination <,> and downright hostile

opposition <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#33:1:A> It's as if we're in a car that's heading at a brick wall at a

hundred miles an hour <,> and everybody in the car is simply arguing over

where they <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> sit <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#34:1:A> We're not seriously discussing slowing down or changing directions

<,> we're debating about whether that brick wall that we see is real <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#35:1:A> I wouldn't mind as much <,> if I wasn't also a captive passenger in

that car <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#36:1:A> Every generation occupies a brief moment in time <,> bridging all

those that have passed on before them <,> <}> <-> to </-> <=> with </=> </}>

all of those <,> of the future unborn generations <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#37:1:A> North American aboriginal people <,> speak of reflecting back on

seven generations of their ancestors and ahead to seven generations of their

children and only then <,> do they make a decision <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#38:1:A> Today the primary global competitors on earth are the nations of

the north <,> plundering the planet's resources <,> to support <}> <->

enormous mindless </-> uh sorry <=> economies <,> mindlessly </=> </}>

committed to growth <,> and hoarding the vast bulk of the world's wealth <,>

while producing most of the toxic pollution <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#39:1:A> Having wantonly squandered and compromised our natural resources

<,> we now demand that countries in the south <,> do a better job <,> yet we

plead poverty <,> to avoid <.> m </.> a more equitable distribution of wealth

<,> resources and appropriate technology <,> and refusing to cut back <,> on

our own consumptive lifestyles <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#40:1:A> Yet there is a massive treasure trove to be mined <,> that's

available to all of us <,> and that is the global military budget <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#41:1:A> When a country is dragged into war <,> we don't <,> <}> <-> have

</-> <=> hear </=> </}> economic or political justifications for not

responding <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#42:1:A> Well <,> we are in the middle of the mother of all battles
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#43:1:A> The fight to keep this earth habitable
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#44:1:A> All we need is vision <,> leadership <,> and courage to take the

first step <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#45:1:A> Who can best challenge us to get our priorities straight
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#46:1:A> I believe it is the most important group of people on earth <,> our

children
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#47:1:A> And I'd like to take this opportunity <,> to let you hear from some

of them <,> from four of them who in fact made me come here in the first

place
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#48:1:A> I wouldn't have come here <,> if they hadn't demanded <,> that I

came <,> as their chaperone
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#49:1:A> So I'd like to introduce you then <,> to four girls <,> who would

like to give you their impressions of what the problem is <O> Audience claps

</O> <&> Mic thumping </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-029#50:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-029#51:1:B> Hello I am Severn Suzuki from the Environmental Children's

Organization
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#52:1:B> We are a small group of twelve year olds from Canada who are trying

to make a difference
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#53:1:B> We've raised all the money to come here by ourselves because we

have to speak to you adults <,> to change your ways <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#54:1:B> Future generations cannot speak here so I am speaking for them <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#55:1:B> The cries of starving children around the world are not heard <,>

so I am speaking for them <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#56:1:B> The countless animals who are dying across this planet <,> I am

speaking for them too <,> and we can't afford not to be heard <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#57:1:B> I'm afraid to go out in the sun now because of the holes in the

ozone
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#58:1:B> I'm afraid to breathe the air because I don't know what chemicals

are in it
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#59:1:B> I used to go fishing in Vancouver with my dad <,> until just a few

years ago we found the fish full of cancerous tumours <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#60:1:B> And now we hear about animals and plants going extinct everyday

vanishing forever <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#61:1:B> Did you have to worry about these things when you were my age
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#62:1:B> Think about it <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#63:1:B> This is happening before our eyes and yet we act as if we have all

the time we want <,> and all the solutions
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#64:1:B> In my lifetime I already know <,> that my children will not be

fishing in the waters of Vancouver <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#65:1:B> I'm only a child and I don't have all the solutions but I want you

to <.> y </.> realize <,> neither do you <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#66:1:B> You don't know how to fix all the holes in our ozone layer
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#67:1:B> You don't know how to bring the salmon back up a dead stream
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#68:1:B> You don't know how to bring back an animal now extinct
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#69:1:B> And you can't bring back the forest that once grew in a now desert
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#70:1:B> I am asking you <,> if you don't know how to fix it <,> don't break

it <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#71:1:B> Here you may be delegates of your corporations <,> organizers

reporters or politicians <,> but really you are mothers and fathers <,>

brothers and sisters <,> aunts and uncles and all of you <,> are someone's

child <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#72:1:B> We are all a family five billion strong in fact thirty million

species strong and borders and governments cannot change that
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#73:1:B> We are all in this together and should act as one single planet <,>

for a single goal <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#74:1:B> In my anger I am not blind and in my fear I am not afraid to tell

<}> <-> how </-> <=> the world how </=> </}> I feel
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#75:1:B> In my country <,> <}> <-> we take so </-> <=> we make so </=> </}>

much waste
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#76:1:B> We buy and throw away <,> buy and throw away and yet northern

countries will not share with the needy
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#77:1:B> No even when we have more than enough <,> afraid to lose some of

our wealth <,> afraid to share
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#78:1:B> If all the money spent on war was spent on finding environmental

answers and agreements what a place <.> ear </.> this earth would be
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#79:1:B> At school even in kindergarten you teach us how to behave in the

world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#80:1:B> Why can't you do what you teach us
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#81:1:B> Where are our examples
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#82:1:B> You teach us to clean up our mess <,> not to fight with others <,>

to work things out <,> to respect others <,> not to hurt other creatures <,>

to share not be greedy <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#83:1:B> Parents should be able to quell their child's fears by saying

everything is going to be alright
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#84:1:B> We're doing the best we can <,> or it's not the end of the world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#85:1:B> Until we start to change I don't think you can say that to us

anymore
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#86:1:B> Please <,> think of us
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#87:1:B> Thank you <O> Audience claps </O>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S2B-029#88:1:C> I challenge any world leader to look me straight in the eye

and say yes <,> we're going to make a difference
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#89:1:C> My name is Vanessa and I'm a part of the Environmental Children's

Organization <,> ECO <,> and I'm here today to express to you how concerned I

really am about the environment
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#90:1:C> It's important for me to ask the politicians <,> that they're not

going to throw my future out the window
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#91:1:C> Coming <}> <-> up </-> <.> h </.> <=> up </=> </}> here today I

have nothing to lose except my future
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#92:1:C> Losing my future's not like losing an election <,> or a few points

on the stock market <,> and no one will be speaking for all the unborn

children <,> who will have no voice here in Rio
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#93:1:C> <}> <-> The </-> <,> <=> The </=> </}> decisions made <?> and

unsaid </?> will not just affect this year <,> but many generations to come
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#94:1:C> This conference will not just affect us <,> but children all around

the world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#95:1:C> We <,> as children <,> are not easily heard <,> but our opinions

are just as important of those of <.> Mul </.> Mister Mulroney <,> and Mister

Bush
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#96:1:C> I would <.> al </.> like to remind the world leaders <,> who

they're making their decisions for <,> them <,> or us
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#97:1:C> Who are going to be living in the next generation
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#98:1:C> Thank you <O> Audience claps </O>

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S2B-029#99:1:D> <O> Spanish comments </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#100:1:D> My name is Michelle <?> Quigg </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#101:1:D> I was born in Canada and I've lived there all my life
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#102:1:D> I am also part Colombian and have been fortunate enough to have

visited Colombia several times
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#103:1:D> I would like to share with <,> you my impressions of the contrast

between the two countries
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#104:1:D> In Canada we live the privileged life <,> with plenty of food

water and shelter
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#105:1:D> We have watches computers television sets <,> cars <,> that make

our lives easier
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#106:1:D> Every day I wake up and go to school knowing that when I return

home <}> <-> I will </-> <=> there will </=> </}> be food on the table
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#107:1:D> As a child I don't have to worry about having enough to eat <,> or

somewhere to sleep
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#108:1:D> Often <,> those children living the privileged life <,> are

concerned with trivial things <,> perhaps the latest styles or toys
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#109:1:D> Then <,> just ten hours south of Canada in Colombia I feel <,>

like I'm in an entirely different world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#110:1:D> There I see children my own age living on the streets with the

fear that they will be murdered by officials during the night
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#111:1:D> Children begging for money
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#112:1:D> Nine year old boys carrying bricks and planks of wood too heavy

for their young bodies to support
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#113:1:D> Children <,> filling potholes and shining shoes
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#114:1:D> Living in houses of bags and roof shingles
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#115:1:D> While flying on the airplane into Rio I saw the favelas <&>

Brazilian slums </&> <,> countless shacks with no clean water or sewage

treatment which in Canada we take for granted
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#116:1:D> I can't stop thinking that these are children my own age
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#117:1:D> That it makes a tremendous difference where you are born
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#118:1:D> That I could be one of those children living in the favelas of Rio
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#119:1:D> I could be a child starving in Africa <,> or a victim of war in

Somalia <,> or a beggar in Colombia
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#120:1:D> It just makes me realize how lucky I am to live where I do
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#121:1:D> It doesn't matter where we live <,> children are children with the

same hopes <,> and fears
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#122:1:D> In Colombia many starve yet in Canada people are overweight from

eating too much
<ICE-CAN:S2B-029#123:1:D> We engage in activities such as pie-eating contests where people

stuff themselves with food <,> they don't need <,> meanwhile millions of

innocent people suffer from malnutrition </I>
