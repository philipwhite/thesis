<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-049#1:1:A> All of these rods and <,> things <unclear> four words

</unclear> teaching multiplication <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#2:1:A> And a <unclear> word </unclear> processing cabinet but <,> <O> laugh

</O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#3:1:A> But it's really good
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#4:1:A> It's really fun and it's really uh <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#5:1:A> I find it's very interesting way to teach the kids <,> math right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#6:1:A> I just <unclear> four or five mumbled words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#7:1:A> Uhm and these kids really get <}> <-> to </-> <=> to </=> </}> use

the stuff and think of ways of using <,> math
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#8:1:A> So <,> <}> <-> it's a </-> <=> it's a </=> </}> bit more interesting

process but I mean I never taught math in my life
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#9:1:A> It never even occurred to me that I'd ever have to so <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#10:1:A> But uhm granted I teach the lower levels so I figured there was

very little that I couldn't figure out the day before <O> laugh </O> but
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#11:1:A> You know when you have the plans <}> <-> if </-> <=> if </=> </}>

all of a sudden you didn't understand it the way it was written in the book

and there aren't any more examples or activities in the book well you have to

come up with more so
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#12:1:A> You get pretty busy <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#13:1:A> Uhm <,> I've gone off on all sorts of things so I
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#14:1:A> Well I've already told you about <unclear> word </unclear>

classrooms <unclear> word </unclear> small groups
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#15:1:A> Yeah so like <}> <-> you could </-> <=> you could </=> </}>

conceivably end up with a class at three levels but you have no more than

twelve kids <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#16:1:A> So that's a big thing and

<$ZS> <ICE-CAN:S2A-049#17:1:Z> <O> audience member comments </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-049#18:1:A> That's a <unclear> word </unclear> question

<$ZR> <ICE-CAN:S2A-049#19:1:Z> <O> audience member asks a question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-049#20:1:A> Mmm not really
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#21:1:A> Well <,> uhm my first experience was in like I say in a small

community and their exposure to English was so limited
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#22:1:A> <}> <-> They had </-> <=> At that time they only had </=> </}> one

T V station so the only English they were hearing were from the five southern

teachers who were there and actually that's not true because two of the

primary <}> <-> two one of </-> <=> one of them </=> </}> was French so four

southern teachers and the nurse
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#23:1:A> No he was French
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#24:1:A> <}> <-> So </-> <=> so </=> </}> you know the only English they

ever heard was in school so I mean that's not a heck of a lot of exposure
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#25:1:A> So <}> <-> they they </-> <=> they </=> </}> <}> <-> kinda </-> <+>

kind of </+> </}> scared me my first day I go in there you know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#26:1:A> The first day is always the worst day in the world no matter how

many <,> times you do it too <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#27:1:A> The first day of the year is always bad
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#28:1:A> You don't know the kids and uhm go and ask them questions so what

did you do this summer you know or anything
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#29:1:A> And this sea of little faces just stares back at you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#30:1:A> <O> whispering </O> <unclear> two or three words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#31:1:A> Nobody even tries
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#32:1:A> Oh my God I'm <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> die <O>

groan </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#33:1:A> They don't talk a lot either so it's like kind of a cultural thing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#34:1:A> First start at the
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#35:1:A> They're not <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> be leaping

going oh oh oh yes <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#36:1:A> You know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#37:1:A> The day you see that call me
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#38:1:A> <O> laugh starts </O> You know it's like that's a miracle <O> laugh

ends </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#39:1:A> That never happens
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#40:1:A> And so <,> when they all sort of have varying language skills it's

almost hard to find out whether they do or not because it's really hard to

pull it out
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#41:1:A> But uh that group <}> <-> they </-> <=> they </=> </}> didn't talk

a whole lot and so I found out that I had great expectations and all sorts of

ideas of stuff that I'd been doing that <,> really rapidly got cut down to

size
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#42:1:A> And <,> that's one of the things that you find no matter where you

go
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#43:1:A> Like uh I taught grade six the following year <}> <-> with </-> <=>

with </=> </}> <unclear> word </unclear> in Inukjuak and I had fourteen

students <,> one level
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#44:1:A> And their language abilities I mean I was <}> <-> just </-> <=>

just </=> </}> floored they were just so completely different than the other

kids
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#45:1:A> <}> <-> They </-> <=> They </=> </}> did English in grade three but

they'd had consistent one level classes <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}>

consistent teachers <}> <-> probly </-> <+> probably </+> </}> like <}> <-> a

couple of </-> <=> two of </=> </}> their teachers <,> uhm had been in this

village for like at that time three or four years so they already had a very

good command of what they were doing and you could tell like we used to

always say well like we know the kids that had gone <}> <-> from </-> <=>

from </=> </}> <@> Mabel </@> to <@> Sandy </@> or <@> Sandy </@> to <@>

Mabel </@> they switched levels at one point but
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#46:1:A> You could tell that these kids had gone through these teachers cos

they were very very good teachers and they had a really really solid base
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#47:1:A> And there's no doubt in our mind it was these two teachers that had

made a difference <,> for these kids
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#48:1:A> Uhm and so they they could talk up a storm if they had the desire

to <}> <-> get </-> <=> do </=> </}> that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#49:1:A> Sometimes you <unclear> word </unclear> but
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#50:1:A> They definitely had uhh a higher level <}> <-> of </-> <=> of </=>

</}> English
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#51:1:A> But even so <}> <-> it's </-> <=> it's </=> </}> <,> lower than <,>

<.> sta </.>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#52:1:A> <}> <-> We still </-> <=> There's still </=> </}> a long way to go
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#53:1:A> And I think we haven't challenged them necessarily enough along the

way
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#54:1:A> I think a lot of the time we've sort of gone oh well we don't <}>

<-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> you know upset them and we don't want

them to think they can't do it <}> <-> kinda </-> <+> kind of </+> </}> thing

so uhm go a little under <unclear> two words </unclear> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#55:1:A> That's my theory I <.> d </.>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#56:1:A> I'm sure my colleagues would disagree with me on that one and

certain <unclear> word </unclear> <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#57:1:A> I feel they should be reading
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#58:1:A> Certainly when I had my group my <.> w </.>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#59:1:A> The other thing that happens is the longer you're there is the

easier it gets and this is probably true wherever you would go but <,> once

you've taught the same level more than once <,> then <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#60:1:A> But the third year is the greatest year <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#61:1:A> It's like you've got it nailed by that time and you can do all

these things that you've dreamt of doing before but <}> <-> you </-> <=> you

</=> </}> didn't have the energy to pull off
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#62:1:A> Cos it takes a lot of energy <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#63:1:A> It takes a lot of energy to be on every day all day
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#64:1:A> <}> <-> And </-> <=> And </=> </}> you have to really <,> really

really be on the ball
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#65:1:A> And nobody ever seems to ever get sick because there's never any

substitutes
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#66:1:A> So you go in if you're dying because you don't really you know you

don't know what they're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> do if they
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#67:1:A> They cancel school if they can't find a substitute for the kids
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#68:1:A> So you know that the kids are just <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to

</+> </}> have a day off which <O> laugh </O> may or may not be a good thing

<O> laugh </O> depending on <}> <-> how </-> <=> how </=> </}> things have

been going they may want a break they may want to take a little pause
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#69:1:A> But <,> <}> <-> <.> i </.> uhm it's <.> i </.> </-> <=> it's </=>

</}> very tiring
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#70:1:A> And by your third year <unclear> two words </unclear> you know what

you can do and you know how <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#71:1:A> Even though it's a different group
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#72:1:A> Every year it's a different group right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#73:1:A> No that's not true
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#74:1:A> Actually <,> in split levels you can often have the same kids <,>

for up to two maybe three three or four years which <}> <-> that's </-> <=>

actually I'm sure that's worse </=> </}> I haven't had that experience myself

but I'm sure that's worse for them uhh
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#75:1:A> <O> muttering starts </O> Instead of changing having like the

<unclear> five or six words </unclear> <O> end muttering </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#76:1:A> <O> laugh </O> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#77:1:A> Do all sorts of
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#78:1:A> And you have also <,> all the two years of uh math sheets that

you've <O> laugh starts </O> accumulated so that you don't have to do any

more <O> laugh ends </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#79:1:A> <unclear> two or three words </unclear> starts to wear off a bit

though and you have to start recreating <,> but <,> uhm <,> definitely
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#80:1:A> Uhm I'm so far off of all sorts of things I'm not exactly sure uhm
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#81:1:A> Would you like to see the video
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#82:1:A> <O> audience responds </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#83:1:A> It's a <.> vi </.> uh
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#84:1:A> Some of you were in the hallway talking with me so you know what

I'm talking about
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#85:1:A> I brought a video that was made <,,> some of it was made my first

year in the north
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#86:1:A> I didn't realize that till I saw it the other day uhm
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#87:1:A> It's just a visual <,> thing that like there's no talking <unclear>

word </unclear> just a sound <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> uh visual <O>

loud white noise begins </O> aaah <,,> I was trying to get this so it's at

the right channel but uh

<$ZT> <ICE-CAN:S2A-049#88:1:Z> <O> audience member asks a question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-049#89:1:A> Uhm just <unclear> two or three words </unclear> uhm I don't

know we'll see <}> <-> how it </-> <=> what it </=> </}> looks like
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#90:1:A> I'm assuming it's not the right station yet
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#91:1:A> Uhh it starts off this is
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#92:1:A> <}> <-> If you </-> <=> If you </=> </}> go to Ungava side this is

how you can get there <,> once you get to Kuujjuaq
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#93:1:A> Uhm and <}> <-> it just takes you </-> <=> basically it takes you

</=> </}> to Tasiujaq the little village and a couple of communities that I

haven't quite figured out exactly where <,> uhm
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#94:1:A> But it's kind of almost a year in the life of Tasiujaq
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#95:1:A> <}> <-> There's there's </-> <=> There's </=> </}> a festival not a

festival a wedding or something I can't <}> <-> member </-> <+> remember </+>

</}> what
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#96:1:A> And <unclear> <?> you go out fishing </?> </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#97:1:A> So I may say things as we go along because I get all excited cos

these are my old students <O> laugh </O> and stuff that are there
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#98:1:A> But <}> <-> it it's </-> <=> there's </=> </}> no classroom stuff

it's all <,,> <&> about 5 minutes of loud video, some untranscribed text </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-049#99:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#100:1:A> They won <}> <-> a a a </-> <=> a </=> </}> fishing boat <,> in

Halifax actually it was the <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#101:1:A> And they <}> <-> hadta </-> <+> had to </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#102:1:A> The only way you can get there <}> <-> acourse </-> <+> of course

</+> </}> is to go all the way around all the way around Labrador and <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#103:1:A> The day the boat arrived <,> was like our third fourth week in

school and the kids were all excited in the morning and I thought the
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#104:1:A> Something was up
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#105:1:A> We didn't know what <,> I mean <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#106:1:A> Came back to school after lunch <,> like we hadn't been in school

fifteen minutes when every kid takes off out the door <O> laughs with

audience </O> and all the teachers are standing there going what where'd they

all go
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#107:1:A> We had no idea
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#108:1:A> And what had happened was the boat come in
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#109:1:A> And they'd known cos they could see it from afar in the morning

but nobody really <.> infor </.> like especially the few of us that were new

that year we had no idea <.> th </.> <.> w </.>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#110:1:A> What was this boat what was this whole big thing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#111:1:A> And I mean <}> <-> these the the </-> <=> the </=> </}> men in the

village were on this boat they'd been gone for six weeks these kids hadn't

seen their dads and all the women I mean the whole village
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#112:1:A> <@> A J </@> he <,> gave me plenty of grief
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#113:1:A> Really nice kid but boy was he a pain <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#114:1:A> <}> <-> These are </-> <=> This is </=> </}> one of my other

students too <,> fishing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#115:1:A> But that was like the big <?> pen </?> and that was it for school

for the rest of the day
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#116:1:A> <O> music from video in background starts </O> Those sorts of

things happen
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#117:1:A> You get to do sort of <,> nature trips every so often
<ICE-CAN:S2A-049#118:1:A> <}> <-> Kay </-> <+> Okay </+> </}> can't do anything else today
