<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#1:1:A> Yeah so I just got a message from my professor <,> uhm on <,>

the answering machine saying that uh <,> he's <}> <-> gonna <  </-> <+> going

to </+> </}> ask me to do some research this summer
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#2:1:A> Which would be fun
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#3:1:A> And last time <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> did research for him

<,> a summer ago <,> on uhm <,> South Africa
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#4:1:A> I did a little bit on South Africa and I did <}> <-> some </-> <=> a

</=> </}> literature review on uh Canadian politics
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#5:1:A> And recently actually while I was working with uh <@> James Teed

</@> he asked me uh <,> uh to do something on uh Harold Innes
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#6:1:A> Do you know who Harold Innes is

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#7:1:B> Yes I do

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#8:1:A> So uhm <,> maybe he wants to go back to that
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#9:1:A> So

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#10:1:B> <{> <[> Wow </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#11:1:A> <[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#12:1:B> <}> <-> This is you political <.> spec </.> </-> <=> uh this

is your <{> <[> political </[> </=> </}>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#13:1:A> <[> <unclear> word </unclear> </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#14:1:B> <}> <-> He wants to do </-> <=> uh you think he might want to

do </=> </}> research on Harold Innes

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#15:1:A> Yeah well he wrote on it before amd then he went to Europe so

I imagine you can't do research on Innes while you're in Europe so <,> he may

want to come back to that

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#16:1:B> Well there is uhm <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#17:1:B> I was just reading a newsletter from <}> <-> this </-> <=> uhm the

</=> </}> Canadian Historical Association
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#18:1:B> And someone has mentioned in passing to this <,> uh renewal of

interest in Harold Innes
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#19:1:B> And I was kind of surprised because uhm <,,> uh sort of in the

field of my particular specialization <,> uh Innis is just someone who is

wrong

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#20:1:A> <{> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#21:1:B> <[> <O> laugh </O> You know uh </[> </{> or wasn't uhm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#22:1:A> Staple <unclear> word </unclear>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#23:1:B> No not so much the <}> <-> <.> st </.> </-> <+> staple </+>

</}>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#24:1:B> Well in part for me is the way he uses staple food to describe the

economy of France but also <,> the way he applied it to the fur trade <{1>

<[1> <,> in </[1> his book The Fur
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#25:1:B> <{2> <[2> Trade </[2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#26:1:A> <[1> Mhhm </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#27:1:A> <[2> Mhhm </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#28:1:B> It's just very uhm is still read and still worth reading but

<,> uhm <,> he missed a lot of what was going on
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#29:1:B>
#So <,,> I guess I just don't know why people uhm find him <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#30:1:B> <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> guess I don't even know much about

Innes anyways

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#31:1:A> <}> <-> I've only </-> <=> I've only </=> </}> uhm heard of

his work <}> <-> after </-> <=> uh after </=> </}> the conquest and after <,>

probably even after confederation to explain the differences between the

Ontario and the Qu&eacute;bec economies

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#32:1:B> Uh huh

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#33:1:A> And uhm <,> <}> <-> so that's </-> <=> so it </=> </}> seems

kind of interesting from my perspective
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#34:1:A> <}> <-> And </-> <=> And </=> </}> probably to tell you the truth I

bet <,> my prof who's interested in him is partly interested because uh <@>

Guinness </@> offers a way of explaining <,> Qu&eacute;bec's <,> uhm <,>

inequality the inequality of Qu&eacute;bec's economy in a way that <}> <->

isn't </-> <=> isn't </=> </}> negative to uh a Qu&eacute;bec nationalist

perspective
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#35:1:A> Because it kind of blames everything on uh natural resources and

<}> <-> not </-> <=> doesn't </=> </}> put any on the culture
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#36:1:A> So uhm that's probably one of the reasons that he's interested <}>

<-> in </-> <=> in </=> </}> Innes

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#37:1:B> Hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#38:1:A> So

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#39:1:B> So uh let's talk the bucks <{> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#41:1:B> <}> <-> I mean it uh </-> <=> I'm </=> </}> doing research for

a prof uh in my department
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#42:1:B> And <,,> uhm <,> fortunately that research <}> <-> is not </-> <=>

it's really </=> </}> just finding a bunch of documents
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#43:1:B> <}> <-> And it's not it's not </-> <=> It doesn't </=> </}> take me

away from my research because uhm <}> <-> I'm </-> <=> I </=> </}> would be

and I find something for her

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#45:1:A> <[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#46:1:A> <[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#47:1:B> But <,> uhm <,> <}> <-> we </-> <=> we </=> </}> haven't

really discussed money or anything uh

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#48:1:A> <}> <-> I I </-> <=> I </=> </}> suspect that it's only going

to be like eleven bucks an hour

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#49:1:B> <}> <-> Well this is what </-> <=> yeah this is the </=> </}>

kind of ballpark <,,> <}> <-> that </-> <=> that </=> </}> this other prof

mentioned uh sort of
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#50:1:B> <}> <-> I </-> <=> uh she </=> </}> said keep track of your hours

and you know uh we'll figure out uhm

<=> what is a </=> </}> research assistant paid approximately per hour and uh

<,> she thought it was something like twelve so

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#52:1:A> She said twelve

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#53:1:B> Yeah

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#55:1:A> <[> <unclear> words </unclear> </[> </{> sure she just told

you to keep track of your hours and then tell her at the end

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#56:1:B> Yeah

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#57:1:A> That would be good actually for me
<ICE-CAN:S1A-024#58:1:A> Do you think it would be dishonest to <,,> continue to <{> <[> <,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-024#62:1:B> Uhm yes
