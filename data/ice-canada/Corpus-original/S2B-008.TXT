<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#1:1:A> Good afternoon
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#2:1:A> Here's the C B C four thirty news
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#3:1:A> The owners of the Quebec Nordiques <&> The Nordiques are a

professional hockey team </&> say he province hasn't offered the kind of help

needed to keep the team in Quebec City
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#4:1:A> President <@> Daniel Marchand </@> says the owners unanimously

decided the team has to be sold
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#5:1:A> <@> Ron Smith </@> reports

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#6:1:B> The Nordiques may never play again in Quebec City
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#7:1:B> The team faces elimination in New York City in game six of its

playoff round against the Rangers <,,> and team owners say <,> they've

decided the climate just isn't right to keep the team in Quebec City <O>

Speech in French </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#8:1:B> Today in the National Assembly Premier Parizeau tabled the offer his

government made to keep the team
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#9:1:B> The province is willing to cover up to twenty-one million dollars in

team losses over the next three years
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#10:1:B> In the meantime Quebec would study whether the team really needs a

new twenty-thousand seat coliseum
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#11:1:B> Team owner <@> Daniel Marchand </@> says <quote> that's not enough

</quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#12:1:B> <@> Marchand </@> wants the new hockey rink built right away <,>

and in that arena <,> he wants a government-run casino that would dedicate

its earnings to support the team
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#13:1:B> That way <,> he says the Nordiques would be able to guarantee

they'll stay in Quebec City
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#14:1:B> And he says the owners have voted unanimously to go if they don't

get what they want
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#15:1:B> The Nordiques could be knocked out of the play-offs tonight <,> but

the negotiations with the government are likely to go into overtime
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#16:1:B> The team president has asked to meet the Premier <,> to make one

last plea for government money for the team
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#17:1:B> <@> Ron Smith </@> C B C <&> Canadian Broadcasting Corp. </&> news

<,> Quebec City

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#18:1:A> Now the owner of <indig> Les Nordiques </indig> <@> Daniel

Marchand </@> is in New York
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#19:1:A> But <@> Leona Davis </@> has spoken to a team representative
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#20:1:A> She is on the line with us
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#21:1:A> <@> Leona </@>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#22:1:C> Yes hi <@> Bill </@> uhm
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#23:1:C> I spoke with <@> John Letourneau </@> who's a spokesman for the

team here in Quebec City

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#24:1:A> Uhm hmm

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#25:1:C> And he wouldn't say that it was game over as far as

negotiations but he really talks <}> <-> as though </-> <=> in terms of </=>

</}> the very slimmest opening
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#26:1:C> And it all hinges on that meeting between <@> Daniel Marchand </@>

the president of the Nordiques and Jacques Parizeau where they would discuss

this question of the casino
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#27:1:C> Now Jacques Parizeau has said no in two ways
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#28:1:C> He has said first of all that <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}>

matter of the casino is not his alone to decide but it's a government

decision
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#29:1:C> And he's also said that he has mandated <@> Joel Tessier </@> uhm

to be a negotiator in this affair and so he sees no need to meet directly

with <@> Marchand </@> on this sort of question
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#30:1:C> So this looks very much as though things are going down the <}> <->

train </-> <=> drain </=> </}> on that
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#31:1:C> And <@> Letourneau </@> says that this offer from the government

was clearly insufficient
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#32:1:C> He reiterated their three demands which is the new arena <,> uhm

secondly uh help in covering the uh interim financing for the team while

there is construction of that new arena
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#33:1:C> <}> <-> There </-> <=> Its </=> </}> deficit could be <,> ten or

twelve million over the next two years and he says that would sink the team

<}> <-> if it </-> <=> if it </=> </}> isn't covered
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#34:1:C> They would go bankrupt
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#35:1:C> And then also the question of long-term financing through something

like the casino
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#36:1:C> And <@> Letourneau </@> says they have gathered seventy-five

thousand signatures on a petition that <?> they'll </?> be handed in to the

National Assembly tomorrow <,> and he says that's proof enough that those'd

be the kind of people who'd be paying money at the casino to help support the

Nordiques <,> and so the government should be uh getting behind that sort of

will

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#37:1:A> So we wait and see then <@> Leona </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#38:1:A> Thank you very much

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#39:1:C> You're welcome

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#40:1:A> The Mont <unclear> word </unclear> regional health board has

announced its own set of cuts for the next three years
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#41:1:A> They're chopping their budget by about five million dollars <,>

shifting money away from hospitals towards ambulatory care
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#42:1:A> <@> Melissa Pettifer </@> has more

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#43:1:D> The cuts to the health care budget for the area south of

Montreal are not as serious as the ones on the island
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#44:1:D> With a population of one point three million people the Mont

<unclear> word </unclear> works with a budget of just under a billion dollars
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#45:1:D> Now they need to cut a net amount of five million dollars
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#46:1:D> Investing in the prevention and promotion of health is their main

goal <,> and like Montreal they're veering towards ambulatory care by

investing fifteen million in outpatient care
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#47:1:D> That's the upside
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#48:1:D> The downside is the board will close two hundred acute care beds

<,> and one hundred people will lose their jobs over the next three years
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#49:1:D> <@> Henri Gagnon </@> is director general of the board
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#50:1:D> He says in deciding who gets what money <,> their goal was to

establish no quality of services throughout the system <,> and to reward

efficiency

<$E> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#51:1:E> We can say who has uh work to do to <,> uh to obtain the

objectives that we have set
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#52:1:E> We will want to uhm uh make sure that the good managers <,> uh come

out the winners in this kind of an approach

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#53:1:D> The health board will work with a variety of partners

including <?> C L S Cs </?> <&> centre local de services communautaires </&>

school boards <,> and other ministries to implement the cuts
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#54:1:D> <@> Melissa Pettifer </@> C B C news <,> Longueuil

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#55:1:A> Quebec's health minister Jean Rochon says the equivalent of

two thousand more hospital beds will be available for elderly patients

needing long-term care
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#56:1:A> Half the spaces will be created by transforming existing facilities
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#57:1:A> The other half will require new construction by nineteen

ninety-seven
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#58:1:A> Rochon says this plan should help people understand his aim is not

simply to shut down hospitals

<$F> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#59:1:F> The real exercise which is going to be on is that we are

redeploying redeveloping part of our system <}> <-> to </-> <=> to </=> </}>

make a modern system out of it
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#60:1:F> We have a very good system
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#61:1:F> But if we leave it <,> as it is and go like that <,> over the next

five years we will have <}> <-> an </-> <=> a </=> </}> downgraded system

because we will not spend the money in the kind of services that are most

needed <}> <-> for </-> <=> by </=> </}> the population </I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#62:2:A> Canada at five
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#63:2:A> Good afternoon
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#64:2:A> I'm <@> Linda Clark </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#65:2:A> The president of the Quebec Nordiques say the owners have decided

that the team has to be sold
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#66:2:A> <@> Daniel Marchand </@> says the Quebec government has not made an

offer that is good enough to keep the N H L <&> National Hockey League </&>

team in Quebec City
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#67:2:A> The province had said it was willing to cover up to twenty-one

million dollars in team losses for the next three years
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#68:2:A> In the meantime it would study whether the team needs a new twenty

thousand seat arena
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#69:2:A> But <@> Marchand </@> says that isn't enough
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#70:2:A> The Nordiques want the new arena built right away <,> and the

owners want a casino included in the building with all the profits going to

the team
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#71:2:A> <@> Marchand </@> has asked to meet with Premier Parizeau in a

final bid <}> <-> to come up </-> <=> to come to </=> </}> a deal <,> to keep

the team in Quebec City
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#72:2:A> The Conservative majority in the Senate <,> says the

Chr&eacute;tien government is moving in the right direction <,> but the

Tories are being coy about whether they'll end their opposition to Bill C

twenty-two
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#73:2:A> That's the legislation that will kill the agreement to privatize

Pearson airport
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#74:2:A> The Tory senators have been stonewalling the bill because they say

it restricts the airport developers from suing for damages
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#75:2:A> In a bid to break the stalemate <,> the government has agreed to

certain changes in the legislation
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#76:2:A> But even with the proposed amendments <,> the Conservative leader

in the Senate says the bill still denies the developers rights enjoyed by

convicted criminals
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#77:2:A> <@> Adam Carter </@> reports

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#78:2:B> Justice minister Alan Rock went before a Senate committee

today in an effort to persuade his Tory critics that the government

acknowledges that the Pearson bill has its flaws <,> and is trying to improve

it

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#79:2:C> People can't get the code after June thirtieth
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#80:2:C> Here's a change that'll allow them to do so
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#81:2:C> People can't recover expenses incurred after June thirtieth
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#82:2:C> Here's a change that'll allow them to do so
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#83:2:C> You think there should be actions for defamation
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#84:2:C> Help yourself
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#85:2:C> Those are the changes

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#86:2:B> But Rock stood firm on the government's policy not to

compensate the developers for lobbying fees <,> or for lost profits because

the Pearson contract is not going ahead

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#87:2:D> This is a horrendous piece of legislation

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#88:2:A> John Lynch Staunton is the Tory leader in the Senate
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#89:2:A> He says even with Rock's proposed changes <,> the bill is still

discriminatory and punitive

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#90:2:D> In Canada <,> we allow serial murderers <,> we allow convicted

rapists <,> we allow repeat offenders <,> we allow petty thieves <,> the full

protection of the court system <,> and the full protection of the law
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#91:2:D> And in this unprecedented piece of legislation <,> full access to

the courts <,> is still being denied them <,> under these amendments

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#92:2:A> Outside the committee though <,> Lynch Staunton admitted that

with the proposed amendments <,> the government is moving to satisfy some of

the legal and constitutional objections to the Pearson bill
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#93:2:A> But he says the Tories will wait until they have heard from legal

experts <,> before they decide whether to end their ten month long campaign

against the legislation <,> and finally allow it to pass

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#95:2:A> The head of the C R T C <&> Canadian Radio-Television and

Telecommunications Commission </&> says he has an idea that would help

Canadians better understand each other
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#96:2:A> Keith Spicer wants C B C Television to add subtitles to its French

news outside Quebec <,> and its English news inside the province so that in

Quebec you could watch the French news with no <,> distraction
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#97:2:A> It would be only French
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#98:2:A> But if you wanted the English news you could see it with a French

translation
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#99:2:A> And vice versa <}> <-> any kind of </-> <=> I think <,> uh </=>

</}>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#100:2:A> That suggestion could do more for uh intercultural understanding

than anything I can think of
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#101:2:A> Right on target and uh uh I think we have to give Mister Beatty a

few weeks to uh catch his breath but <,> I can assure you we'll come back on

that with him and uh uh see if he will respond to that

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#102:2:A> Spicer was appearing before the heritage committee on

Parliament Hill
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#103:2:A> Ford of Canada plans to spend five hundred million dollars on its

truck plant in Oakville
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#104:2:A> The Canadian president of Ford says the money will be used to

build and equip a body shop <,> and to modify the existing plant
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#105:2:A> <@> Paul Thatcher </@> says the changes will not create new jobs

at the plant once the construction is complete
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#106:2:A> The announcement follows earlier news that Ford will build a four

hundred twenty-three million dollar paint shop at the site
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#107:2:A> The Bank of Canada rate has gone up
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#108:2:A> At its weekly fixing in Ottawa the central bank raised its rate

from seven point four seven percent <,> to seven point six zero percent
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#109:2:A> And there's an indication that the Canadian economy will be

sluggish for a while
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#110:2:A> Statistics Canada reports that the composite leading indicator

grew by only point two percent in April
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#111:2:A> That's half the rate of the previous month
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#112:2:A> The indicator is a basket of ten key economic statistics from

housing to the stock market
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#113:2:A> It's used to gauge what's ahead for the economy

<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#115:2:A> The medical evidence against Marilyn Tan is piling up
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#116:2:A> She's the woman accused of injecting her former boyfriend Con

Boland <}> <-> with </-> <=> of Edmonton with </=> </}> H I V
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#117:2:A> Today the Crown's star medical witness testified that Boland

likely was infected with H I V in June of nineteen-ninety-two
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#118:2:A> Witnesses say that's when Tan injected Boland with H I V-tainted

blood during a trip to California
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#119:2:A> <@> Shauna McDermott </@> reports

<$F> <ICE-CAN:S2B-008#120:2:F> The morning was spent reviewing Con Boland's visit to doctors

over the last fifteen years <,> his sexually transmitted diseases and his H I

<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#121:2:F> Then Crown Prosecutor Brian Peterson went over Doctor <@> Peter

Callan's </@> long list of academic and medical credentials
<ICE-CAN:S2B-008#122:2:F> Peterson asked Conway what H I V infection was <,> how it leads to
