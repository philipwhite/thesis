<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#2:1> <h> Wild Cherries </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#3:1> " Wild cherries can kill a cow," my grandfather said, push <l> ing

his hat back on his head. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#4:1> While he didn't expect me to understand the particulars of the

effects of wild fruit on domesticated animals, he did expect me to help move

the tree. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#5:1> A half mile out into the farm land, a wild cherry tree had been

drawn and quartered across the barbed wire that separated cows from alfalfa;

there had been a summer storm with 80 mile-per-hour winds. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#6:1> And with a broad, flat, speckled hand my grandfather gestured

toward clippers, a chainsaw and other implements with which we would pursue

the task. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#7:1> My grandmother, stocking cap on her head and a hint of curler

underneath, had her own ideas about the tree.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#8:1> But she kept them to herself, along with rows of secrets she'd stored

over the years – each secret labeled and dated like the food she had canned

and stored in the basement. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#9:1> " Cows like to reach over and get cherries from the branches," my

grandfather said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#10:1> " They like to feel like they're stealing some <l> thing." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#11:1> Eighty-six anxious cow faces had watched us drive up through

their pasture to the fallen tree; perhaps they were criminals.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#12:1> Maybe under all that fur they had motives just like the rest of us.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#13:1> Armed with appropriate tools we set about our task. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#14:1> The chainsaw whined angrily in my grandfather's hands.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#15:1> My grandmother handed me a pair of clippers that looked like they

could shear off bone. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#16:1> The small jade beads of nascent cherry were smooth and uni <l>

form, attached by delicate necks of stems.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#17:1> They made perfect poi <l> son, green and beguiling." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#18:1> " You should have worn you a hat," my grandmother said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#19:1> Then she dragged away a loose branch after it had been cut. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#20:1> My grandfather watched our progress from time to time, peering

over the whine of the saw.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#21:1> A perpetual noticer, my father's father.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#22:1> Noticing this and that, he added up each detail and weighed it

against your character: the wasted motion in a given activity, the missed

cue, a method that was not his method and therefore deemed inefficient. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#23:1> They said he was a brilliant man, my grandfather who never fin

<l> ished high school; tested higher than 140 IQ points in the Service. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#24:1> But a brilliant man with no patience is just an impatient man;

Solomon without circumspection. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#25:1> All of us had learned early on that my grandfather had no mar <l>

gin for error, no kindness for misunderstanding. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#26:1> And his impatience was headed my way, the flying shrapnel of

scrutiny. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#27:1> My hands faltered here and there: a wrong connection while try

<l> ing to hook a chain around the tree trunk.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#28:1> Other minor errors at every turn. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#29:1> These errors told him volumes about me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#30:1> Even menial deeds revealed one's character, so he thought. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#31:1> This was my grandfather's court of law; we understood that –

grandmother, my father, and me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#32:1> He had long since appoint <l> ed himself judge and jury of the mown

field.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#33:1> We were the defen <l> dants. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#34:1> All details recorded here would be used against you immediately:

the way my grandmother pulled the truck up too far when he had told her to

drive down the hill.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#35:1> Absent-minded.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#36:1> The way he'd seen me carry the <}> <-> waterjug </-> <+> water jug

</+> </}> , by the strap and not by the handle.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#37:1> Careless. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#38:1> His impatience made him appear larger with each sharp command.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#39:1> " Cut the wheel.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#40:1> Cut your wheels!"
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#41:1> " Look out you don't get that on you."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#42:1> " Go on now; I told you, go on now." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#43:1> Then there were the flat hands that beat the air to direct you;

the exactness of the close-shaved white hair; the girth that hung around him

as armor. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#44:1> Even at 77, he was a man to be feared.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#45:1> But his was inadvertent cruelty, the boy who grows old and never

learns to taper his will with tenderness. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#46:1> Yet somehow the pearl-like wild cherries were the culprit.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#47:1> The tree itself an object to be reviled. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#48:1> Once the branches were shorn off the trunk, and the trunk sawed

off at the roots, the hulking tree carcass could be left in the field.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#49:1> A curio for the herd. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#50:1> Next the leafy arms had to be gathered and loaded up onto the

back of the pick-up. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#51:1> There was no method now, only struggle. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#52:1> " She works like a Turk," my grandfather would later say, half in

pride, half in shame. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#53:1> " Wouldn't have hurt your daddy to try and have a boy, just one"

– that was his other refrain. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#54:1> My father said he'd learned most of what he knew about my

grandfather from his mother.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#55:1> She was the <}> <-> mythmaker </-> <+> myth maker </+> </}> , a

storyteller, a translator.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#56:1> The smoother-over of rough words, she had become my grandfather's

tenderness, a personal attribute outside the body. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#57:1> During those hot hours, the tree-moving task hurt each of us in a

distinctive way.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#58:1> My grandmother met her sorrow bent under the weight of dragged

branches; my own <}> <-> ribcage </-> <+> rib cage </+> </}> ached from the

twist <l> ing motion each time a bundle of long twigs left my arms for the

bed of the blue truck.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#59:1> My grandfather glimpsed his own anguish in the shadow of the fallen

trunk. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#60:1> In addition to his share of the branches, my grandfather carried

my worth along with this burden.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#61:1> How we'd all failed him at one time or other – he carried that too.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#62:1> My failed attempt to attach a hook to the correct peg on the back

bumper of the pick-up truck, that also made its way into his satchel of

worries. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#63:1> His cocked head registered disappointment that my reputed edu <l>

cation from the city hadn't taken the form of common sense in the

countryside.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#64:1> To him knowledge was a transferable coupon, redeemable in all

situations. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#65:1> It was plain for all to see in that pasture: my knowledge without

application; his wisdom without serenity. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#66:1> When all the branches were safely piled up in the flatbed, we

drove down to a gully beyond the adjacent meadow where five-foot high bales

of rolled hay stood motionless. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#67:1> My grandparents were seated in the cab of the truck.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#68:1> Hands too tired, my folded arms gripped the rusted white railing of

the pick-up; the rusted railing that mimicked the skin of a heifer. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#69:1> Then we reached the ditch. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#70:1> My job was to stand on the tailgate and fling the largest

branches into the gully. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#71:1> " Get them out there as far as you can," my grandfather

instructed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#72:1> Between the heat and tangle, my branches flew low, pitiful. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#73:1> It was more an act of courting gravity rather than taking flight.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#74:1> " That's alright," my grandmother soothed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#75:1> " You did alright," she repeated. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#76:1> Alright? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#77:1> The city with all its shrewdness had left me on my own at the

gravel path that led to my <w> grandparents' </w> farm. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#78:1> Virginia: it didn't care about me – girl, daughter,

grand-daughter, first generation Yankee.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#79:1> Born in the North, but forever beholden to the South. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#80:1> Me, the wild cherry tree, branches blown this way and that.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#81:1> It was the free spirit in me they wanted to shear off.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#82:1> And load it up, and cart it off to be dumped somewhere. </p> <O>

<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#83:2> H. R. PERCY
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#84:2> <h> Sightings Astern </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#85:2> The thread of remembrance, ever more tenuous, leads back and back

until I find myself in a dark closet, kicking the door and bawling with all

the power of my two-and-a-half-year-old lungs.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#86:2> I am in hospital awaiting — or perhaps recovering from — an opera <l>

tion on my neck, the scars of which I yet bear.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#87:2> But far deeper was the scar resulting from the terror of drowning in

that palpable dark.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#88:2> Whole years of my later life have left scarce a memory to be gleaned,

yet I have but to close my eyes and I can feel the suffocat <l> ing pressure

of that antiseptic-smelling darkness and hear my own screams.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#89:2> What wickedness of mine could possibly have merited such punishment?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#90:2> Impossible, now, to imagine what I could have done to provoke the

nurse into leaving me in that dread place until I screamed myself insensible.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#91:2> Of all the other traumas that must have beset me, abandoned there —

forever, for all I knew to the contrary — in that alien place of many beds

and sickening smells, nothing remains.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#92:2> The nurse herself is no more than a big white bosom and a formless

mask of malevolence, but she stalked me for years through the dark places and

darker dreams of child <l> hood. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#93:2> It could not have endeared me to her that I spilled the beans to

my parents when they came to visit.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#94:2> I can't remember doing it, but I do have a very clear sense of myself

lying there steeped in self-pity, and of the dawn of indignation in my

mother's face as she rose and turned to incite my father to vengeance: images

distilled, no doubt, from their later telling of it.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#95:2> But I do clearly recall that any comfort I may have drawn from her

compassion and his anger was supplanted by despair when it became evident

that they were going home and leaving me there. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#96:2> Memories of the years immediately following decline to fall into

any sequence other than that imposed by hindsight.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#97:2> Memory is more associative than sequential, so that what comes

naturally to mind in the wake of that early ordeal by darkness is the thrill

of rid <l> ing Hucks's bus, ascending the hill on the way to Eccles with a

crescendo whine of gears.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#98:2> My father was taking me to the clinic in Maidstone, as he would do at

intervals for a couple of years after my operation.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#99:2> My feelings about these excursions were very mixed.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#100:2> I loved the bus ride as much as I hated the clinic.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#101:2> Mr Hucks was a jovial man who seemed to enjoy my reverential

interest in the way he worked the steering wheel — immense in memory — and

the levers almost as tall as me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#102:2> I was fascinated by the virtuoso play of his feet on an array of

pedals almost as numerous, it seemed to me, as those on the church organ,

another object of wonder.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#103:2> I watched his every movement, so that in subsequent games with my

friend Treddy, who never got to go on the bus and so had to play the part of

a horse, I could simulate to perfection every motion, every sound, every

shudder of the Brobdingnagian controls.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#104:2> But it was when Mr Hucks, with all the concentration of a

steeplechaser, swung round the blind bend at the bottom of the hill and put

her to the climb that my fascination mounted to a sort of ecstasy.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#105:2> The sound of the engine rose to a howl that alerted passengers

waiting at The Walnut Tree, well over a mile away.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#106:2> The tall gear lever became a blur, and I remember waiting on one

occasion to see if the violent quivering of the steering wheel, transmitted

through <}> <-> Mr. </-> <+> Mr </+> </}> Hucks, would dislodge the drip from

the end of his nose. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-015#107:2> With diminishing speed and increasing commotion the bus laboured

to the top, paused to catch its breath and still the pound <l> ing of its

elderly heart, then turned to glide, effortless as a bird, down to the

village of Eccles.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#108:2> There I would briefly abandon my scrutiny of Mr Hucks to gaze at

Ticklebelly Row, whose outrageous name my father could not resist pronouncing

as we passed.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#109:2> It was ( and still is) a long terrace of ordinary brick houses set

at right angles to the road.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#110:2> In truth it offered nothing of interest but a fat woman or two

hanging out washing, and a few loungers who sat smoking pipes, waiting for

the Walnut Tree to open; yet such was the spell of that improbable name that

I gazed on the scene in high expectancy, but I never saw any bellies being

tickled.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#111:2> Another landmark for me was Aylesford bridge, a stone structure of

great antiquity.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#112:2> My enthusiasm for the bridge was aroused, however, not by romantic

dreams of bygone days, but by the challenge it present <l> ed to Mr Hucks.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#113:2> The main street was narrow, the bridge narrower still.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#114:2> Pedestrians would cower against the houses as we clattered down the

cobbled street with only a couple of feet to spare on either side. </I> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-015#X115:2> The residents had of necessity to do a little recon <l> noitring

before venturing out of their front doors. </p> </X>
