<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#1:1:B> What

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#2:1:A> You can get in trouble for that

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#3:1:B> That's right
<ICE-CAN:S1A-099#4:1:B> Anyways <,> when <@> Ryan </@> talked to my mom yesterday they had

like pretty lengthy talk I guess and uh <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-099#5:1:B> Like my mom doesn't like <@> Ryan </@>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#6:1:A> Mm hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#7:1:B> But I think she's <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}>

start liking him <,> <{> <[> when he gets back </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#8:1:A> <[> Really </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#9:1:B> Yeah cos I think that she <}> <-> kinda </-> <+> kind of </+>

</}> hit a turning point yesterday <,> when she was talking to him
<ICE-CAN:S1A-099#10:1:B> Because they were talking and uh <,> my mom told him to make sure

he took good care of me when he took me to Windsor for the weekend

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#11:1:A> Good

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#12:1:B> But she hadn't said anything to me about whether I could go or

not

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#13:1:A> <{> <[> Well obviously </[> it's yes

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#14:1:B> <[> <?> She's obviously </?> </[> </{> come to the conclusion

that I'm going anyway so <,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#15:1:A> <{> <[> Yeah </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#16:1:B> <[> She also </[> </{> talked to him about like what he's <}>

<-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> do when he gets out of the military and

stuff and how <,> she really didn't want me to marry someone in the military

because <,> like I didn't know what the military was like and she didn't

really want me to find out what it was like and just all this <}> <-> kinda

</-> <+> kind of </+> </}> stuff
<ICE-CAN:S1A-099#17:1:B> Anyways they talked for a while and <}> <-> <@> Ryan </@> said that

like <@> Ryan </@> used to think </-> <=> Ryan used to hate my mom </=> </}>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#18:1:A> <}> <-> Mkay </-> <+> Okay </+> </}>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#19:1:B> Like she was a real bitch
<ICE-CAN:S1A-099#20:1:B> And that's why they never got along because he hardly ever talked

to her because he thought she was a bitch

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#21:1:A> <}> <-> Mkay </-> <+> Okay </+> </}>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#22:1:B> And then so therefore she thought he was an asshole <,> so it

just <}> <-> kinda </-> <+> kind of </+> </}> went both ways <{> <[> right

</[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#23:1:A> <[> Ah geez </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#24:1:B> But um <,> now <@> Ryan </@> said that <,> he realizes that my

mom is just like expects a lot out of people

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#25:1:A> Mm hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#26:1:B> Like she doesn't expect people to sit on their ass and do

nothing and say yeah this is life
<ICE-CAN:S1A-099#27:1:B> Like she expects them to go off and do things with their life

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#28:1:A> Yeah you grab them by the balls and off you go

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#29:1:B> Yeah and uh <,> she expects a lot of people like she expects a

lot of me and she expects a lot of my sister and she expects a lot of her

boyfriends too right
<ICE-CAN:S1A-099#30:1:B> And uh he said that he used to like think that that was wrong

because it's like my life and I should be able to decide what I'm going to do

with it

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#31:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#32:1:B> But <}> <-> he said </-> <=> he said </=> </}> now he realizes

that you know like <}> <-> I'm his </-> <=> I'm her </=> </}> baby or

whatever
<ICE-CAN:S1A-099#33:1:B> And uh it's <}> <-> not like he </-> <=> not like she </=> </}>

just <}> <-> accepts er </-> <=> expects </=> </}> a lot out of my sister and

I
<ICE-CAN:S1A-099#34:1:B> She expects a lot out of herself also

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#35:1:A> <}> <-> Mkay </-> <+> Okay </+> </}>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-099#36:1:B> She's taking a university course eh
