<ICE-CAN:S1A-016#19:1:B> There was one line in the book that has stayed with me

some good ties with some siblings et cetera <,> and uh some tragedies <,>

for me was he said <quote> I've discovered that finding family ultimately

means losing the family </quote> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-016#22:1:B> And it was an aspect that you hadn't thought about when you first

true-blood siblings <}> <-> his ah </-> <=> his uh </=> </}> blood <,>

parents and he did
<ICE-CAN:S1A-016#24:1:B> And in some cases the scenarios worked out well and others not so

well <,> but his joy <,> was almost immediately snatched by uh some tragedies
<ICE-CAN:S1A-016#25:1:B> And <,,> it made me wonder what sort of victory that was for him

<ICE-CAN:S1A-016#28:1:B> Uh tragedies do happen
<ICE-CAN:S1A-016#29:1:B> He <,> lost a nephew was basically what happened <,> uh from

suicide

<ICE-CAN:S1A-016#146:1:B> He lent me that <,> big boat that he had The Biscayne
<ICE-CAN:S1A-016#147:1:B> And that was one of the first years he went tree-planting
<ICE-CAN:S1A-016#148:1:B> And <,> when he came back he said uh what are these dings doing on

here

<ICE-CAN:S1A-016#150:1:B> I said those were there <O> laugh </O> before you left
<ICE-CAN:S1A-016#151:1:B> And he said no no I'll show you the ones that were there before I

left and of course they had the rust patches and so forth and <unclear> words
