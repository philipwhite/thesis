<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#1:1:A> The number of people who mentioned a cleaner healthier

environment as the most desired thing in their lives was one
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#2:1:A> On the other hand seventeen wished for a car or a T V
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#3:1:A> The number of guns owned by the American family in the study was

four
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#4:1:A> The number of guns owned by the twenty-nine other families two
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#5:1:A> Finally the percentage of income spent on food ranged from nine

percent in the United States to seventy percent in Thailand ninety percent in

Iraq and one hundred percent in Albania

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#8:2:A> Borneo is the third largest island on Earth
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#9:2:A> Situated on the equator Borneo runs twelve hundred kilometres east

to west and nine hundred and sixty kilometres north to south
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#10:2:A> About eighty percent of the island is blanketed by some of the

oldest rainforest ecosystems on Earth
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#11:2:A> According to a book called Nomads of the Dawn by Wade Davis Ian

McKenzie and Shane Kennedy politically Borneo is claimed by three nations
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#12:2:A> Indonesia has the southern two thirds
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#13:2:A> Brunei is an oil-rich sultanate state
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#14:2:A> And the northern states of Sarawak and Sabah are part of Malaysia
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#15:2:A> <@> Malang Foru </@> represents the Penan
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#16:2:A> They're from the high mountains of Sarawak a Malaysian state where

more than half the population is native
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#17:2:A> We talked to <@> Malang </@> when he was in Edmonton recently about

his people their plight and sustainable development <,,> <&> music playing

</&>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#18:2:A> Thousands of indigenous people roamed the forests of Borneo at the

turn of the century
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#19:2:A> Today only eight bands of eastern Penan remain fully nomadic in the

ancient rainforests of Borneo
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#20:2:A> These eight bands comprise three hundred and sixty people the

representatives of age-old cultures that lived in harmony with the rainforest

for thousands of years
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#21:2:A> <@> Malang Foru </@> is a member of the Kelabit tribe and he

represents the tribes of the Penan
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#22:2:A> The Penan is a culture of hunter-gatherers that until not so long

ago lived in perfect sustainability with the ancient rainforests of Borneo
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#23:2:A> I asked <@> Malang </@> what he thinks of sustainable development

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#24:2:Z> <O> speech, 50 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#25:2:A> <@> Malang </@> comes from a culture that has been harvesting

rainforests for centuries
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#26:2:A> But whether they hunted wild boar <,> cut down the odd sago palm or

gathered fruit in the forest the forest continued to survive and evolve as it

always did
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#27:2:A> Today these rainforests are being logged at a breakneck pace
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#28:2:A> According to the Nomads of the Dawn the International Tropical

Timber Organization predicted the exhaustion of the primary forests of

Sarawak by the year two thousand
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#29:2:A> And there's little irony in the fact that the environment minister

for Sarawak owns a trading company that's doing the logging
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#30:2:A> Given this context I asked <@> Malang Foru </@> what he thinks

<mention> sustainability </mention> is

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#31:2:Z> <O> speech, 40 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#32:2:A> The logging in the rainforest is described by the Malaysian

government as sustainable
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#33:2:A> The nomadic Penan of Sarawak are afforded no claims to the land

that they've occupied for thousands of years
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#34:2:A> Not only is the sustainable lifestyle being lost entire cultures

are being lost as well

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#35:2:Z> <O> speech, 55 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#36:2:A> <@> Malang Foru </@> explains that this new form of so-called

sustainable forestry is taking power away from their communities
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#37:2:A> He says it has to do with freedom <,> freedom to choose how to use

their own resources and freedom for their children to choose what they want

to do
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#38:2:A> Culture normally evolves at a painfully slow almost evolutionary

pace
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#39:2:A> But for the Penan of Sarawak changes come like a bolt of lightening

from the sky

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#40:2:Z> <O> speech, 1 min 5 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#41:2:A> According to the book Nomads of the Dawn revenue from logging

in Sarawak accounts for fifty percent of the state budget <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#42:2:A> These state revenues are derived from a royalty of just two percent

of the selling price of the wood mostly raw logs
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#43:2:A> Only about five percent of the people of Sarawk are employed in

logging
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#44:2:A> On December second nineteen ninety-two <@> Malang Foru </@>

addressed the United <w> Nations' </w> forty-seventh general assembly <,>

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#45:2:Z> <O> recorded speech, 1 min 30 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#46:2:A> <@> Malang Foru </@> was one of those Kelabit people who came

down from the mountains to be educated in the new world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#47:2:A> Today he's living in exile in Vancouver British Columbia where he

continues his fight for his people and his home
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#48:2:A> In a world larger than our imagination it is sometimes too easy to

stay locked inside our own economic and cultural context in our search for

sustainable paths to the future

<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#50:2:A> You're listening to the Chevron Ecofile
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#51:2:A> Now here's <@> Kim Alesko </@> with this week's Ecofacts and Trends

</I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#52:3:A> By the year twenty twenty-five more than forty percent of the

world's population three billion people may experience chronic water scarcity

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#53:3:A> This according to Sandra Postel writing in World Watch Magazine
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#54:3:A> As rural populations continue to migrate to the cities they take

water with them
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#55:3:A> Water for agriculture is being lost
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#56:3:A> In addition ground water is being overpumped and aquifers are also

being depleted in many countries <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#57:3:A> According to Postel no one has tallied the potential effect on

future food production <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#58:3:A> It takes up to one thousand tonnes of water to grow one tonne of

grain
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#59:3:A> No one is sure where a sustainable supply of water will come from

in the future
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#60:3:A> The number of large dams has climbed from five thousand in nineteen

fifty to thirty-eight thousand today
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#61:3:A> But this strategy has also had many environmental side effects
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#62:3:A> As the demand for water intensifies many river deltas and coastal

estuaries are losing their capacity to support fisheries
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#63:3:A> The lower reaches of China's Yellow River have gone dry an average

of seventy days a year in each of the last ten years
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#64:3:A> The Aral Sea in central Asia has lost half its area and three

fourths of its volume to cotton production <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#65:3:A> As a consequence twenty out of twenty-four fish species have

disappeared and the fish catch of forty-four thousand tonnes per year has

been lost along with sixty thousand jobs
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#66:3:A> Searching for ways to sustainably use water will become critically

important in maintaining environmental social and economic stability in the

future
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#67:3:A> That's it for this week's Ecofacts and Trends
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#68:3:A> I'm <@> Kim Alesko </@> </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#69:4:A> The Penan of Sarawak in the northern mountains of Borneo are a

nomadic people
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#70:4:A> For centuries they've wandered the remote and ancient rainforests

of Borneo hunting wild boar gathering fruit and harvesting the odd sago palm
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#71:4:A> The Penan are among a disappearing group of people that represent

the Palaeolithic era a time before agriculture
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#72:4:A> According to Nomads of the Dawn a book about the plight of the

Penan it was the advent of agriculture that led to a sedentary lifestyle <,>

modern forms of religion and the separation of humans from nature
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#73:4:A> According to the authors of the book the separation of humanity

from nature set in motion a savage assault upon the Earth by human societies

<,,> <&> music </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#74:4:A> <@> Malang Foru </@> has witnessed the onslaught of modern society

as it has swallowed his people in just one single generation
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#75:4:A> His opinion of development sustainable or otherwise isn't very high

<,>

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#76:4:Z> <O> speech, 50 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#77:4:A> It's not hard to understand <@> Malang's </@> perspective
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#78:4:A> He comes from a culture that lived in perfect harmony with the

ancient rainforests for many thousands of years
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#79:4:A> He listens to us in western society talking about sustainability

but his experience has been that modern society means logging ancient

rainforests and the displacement of his people and their sustainable way of

life
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#80:4:A> To <@> Malang </@> at the very least sustainability should involve

the welfare of his people and the protection of their rainforest home their

culture and their way of life
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#81:4:A> I asked <@> Malang </@> what he thinks the peoples of the planet

should do to strive for sustainability

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#82:4:Z> <O> speech, 40 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#83:4:A> As it is now the Penan and the other rainforest peoples of

Borneo are relocated re-educated and the land in their old territories is

handed over to logging companies
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#84:4:A> <@> Malang </@> speaks of sharing and healthy communities as values

that are critical to sustainability
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#85:4:A> But this is what's being lost as a consequence of so-called

development
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#86:4:A> Ironically <@> Bob Tatar </@> the author of several books on

sustainability told us previously he believes sustainable development

requires as much as anything a process of social evolution
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#87:4:A> He spoke of sharing revitalizing communities and the reversibility

of decisions as important signals of sustainability
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#88:4:A> <@> Malang </@> says that development has unravelled the Penan's

relationship with the land and each other <,>

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#89:4:Z> <O> speech, 40 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#90:4:A> According <@> Bob Tatar's </@> criteria an action needs to be

reversible <,> to be sustainable
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#91:4:A> Living in the forest is a life far from the industrialized consumer

world of wants and desires
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#92:4:A> The Penan are a nomadic people
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#93:4:A> They operate using a concept they call <foreign> <?> malong </?>

</foreign>

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#94:4:Z> <O> speech, 1 min </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#95:4:A> The next season the tree is there to be rediscovered and

claimed yet again
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#96:4:A> The tree belongs to the community <,> and to nobody at the same

time
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#97:4:A> Land ownership had little meaning to the Penan until they were

confronted by those who wanted to take it away
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#98:4:A> As a consequence the Malaysian government does not recognize their

claim to lands that are their traditional homelands
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#99:4:A> Today only eight tribes of the Penan are still living nomadic

lifestyles in the mountain rainforests of Sarawak
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#100:4:A> <@> Malang </@> told us he believes sustainability can only come

from local people who are closest to the land

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#101:4:Z> <O> speech, 40 min </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#102:4:A> There seems little question that industrialized society has

distanced itself from nature <,> and more than a few indigenous peoples and

philosophers think it may be at the root of our cavalier attitude towards the

Earth
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#103:4:A> But if indigenous peoples like the Penan have an answer to living

sustainably with the Earth as did each of our ancestors they do not believe

these peoples wouldn't make the same mistakes given the same tools

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#104:4:Z> <O> speech, 45 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#105:4:A> Humanity has the power to permanently alter the planetary

ecosystems
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#106:4:A> Perhaps this is why <@> Bob Tatar </@> says part of the secret for

sustainability lies in social evolution
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#107:4:A> That's it for our feature report
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#108:4:A> You're listening to the Chevron Ecofile
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#109:4:A> Now here's <@> Kim Alesko </@> with this week's Ecofacts and

Trends </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#110:5:A> The U S Environmental Protection Agency just purchased

fourteen ozone detecting instruments that were originally developed by

scientists at Environment Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#111:5:A> It's called the Brewer Spectrophotometer and it's the most

accurate ozone detecting instrument in the world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#112:5:A> According to <@> Dan Rowe </@> leader of the Environment Canada

team that developed the instrument the Brewer is about the size of a suitcase
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#113:5:A> It monitors stratospheric ozone twenty kilometres above the Earth

by measuring how much damaging ultraviolet radiation hits the ground
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#114:5:A> The Brewer ozone detectors are sold by <?> SyTech </?> Instruments

of Saskatoon and the U S order is worth two million dollars
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#115:5:A> One hundred and seventy-five of the instruments are installed in

thirty-five countries around the world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#116:5:A> When used in conjunction with the satellite data the Brewers ozone

detectors have helped map and track the ozone hole over the Antarctic
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#117:5:A> This last winter or summer for us the Antarctic ozone hole was not

as bad as nineteen ninety-three the worst year on record but at times ozone

levels reached seventy percent below normal
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#118:5:A> Over Canada the hole is not quite as pronounced but in spring

ozone levels can drop to eight percent below normal and in summer four

percent below normal
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#119:5:A> Any drop in ozone concentrations could have negative effects on

humans and other forms of life
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#120:5:A> That's it for this week's Ecofacts and Trends
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#121:5:A> I'm <@> Kim Alesko </@> </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-038#122:6:A> It was after writing a book called <@> Planet Sustainable

</@> Harmonizing Culture and Nature that <@> Bob Tatar </@> came to a new

understanding of sustainable development
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#123:6:A> Like many ecologists <@> Tatar </@> initially greeted the concept

of sustainable development with a distinct lack of enthusiasm
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#124:6:A> But just a few years and four books later <@> Bob Tatar's </@>

become an advocate of sustainable development
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#125:6:A> He believes humanity can find sustainability through social

evolution
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#126:6:A> Today we begin the first of several discussions with ecologist and

author <@> Bob Tatar </@> <,,> <&> music </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#127:6:A> I was reminded of the issue of overconsumption recently when Laura

Love was performing at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#128:6:A> She's a performer who came from a life of poverty in the

south-eastern United States and today she's a successful record producer and

performer
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#129:6:A> As you can imagine her perspective is a little different from that

of the average middle class North American
<ICE-CAN:S2B-038#130:6:A> In one of her rhythmic and evocative songs Less Is More she brings

her own twist to the quantity versus quality dilemma </I>
