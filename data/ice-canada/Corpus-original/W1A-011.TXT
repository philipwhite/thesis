<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-011#1:1> The author of this quotation is T.S. Eliot.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#2:1> It is taken from his work " The Wasteland".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#3:1> The significance is that this is at the end of the poem with reference

to the Fisher King, the speaker is looking out at the Wasteland and wanders

what to do with the ruins of Western culture that lay before him.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#4:1> Is there anything that he can do with the wreckage of civilization <?> ?

</?>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#5:1> Should he try to build a dam <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-011#6:1> The author of this quotation is Lady Mary Wortley <}> <-> Montague

</-> <+> Montagu </+> </}> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#7:1> It is from her poem " The Lover: A Ballad".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#8:1> The significance of it is that her poem is in response to Andrew

Marvell's poem <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> " To His Coy

Mistress".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#9:1> She responds that she knows all too well the <foreign> carpe diem

</foreign> spiel.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#10:1> She knows that time is flying by, as it's consequences are great on

women in her society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#11:1> She is not afraid <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> of

what religion tells her.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#12:1> She has made her mind up that she will wait <del> <unclear> unclear

word </unclear> </del> for her perfect <del> <unclear> unclear word

</unclear> </del> man, and not <quote> seize the day </quote> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-011#13:1> The author of this quote is Virginia Woolf.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#14:1> It is from her work " A Room of One's Own".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#15:1> The significance is that she is stating that the process of coming to

her conclusion, the fiction, is more likely to contain more truth that what

society deems 'fact'.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#16:1> Science is considered to be 'fact', and Woolf feels that it shouldn't

be held in such high regard as <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> 'truth'.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#17:1> She feels that the fiction of the <ul> process </ul> of coming to her

conclusion, is more important than the fact itself <del> <unclear> unclear

word </unclear> </del> in understanding the truth. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-011#18:1> Mathew Arnold wrote this quote, taken from his poem " Dover

Beach".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#19:1> <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> These are the

concluding lines of the poem <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> are significant

because they show how he feels about the world at the time he wrote the poem.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#20:1> He feels that <quote> the Sea of Faith </quote> has <}> <-> receeded

</-> <+> receded </+> </}> , and nothing has filled its gap in the world.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#21:1> Secularization, with rational science, has not filled the void the

Christianity has left.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#22:1> So, as he looks out at the dark plain, he sees no hope in the world.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#23:1> The armies are fighting to no end; they can't see each other - the

battle is pointless.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#24:1> There is nothing left to give hope <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}>

faith in the world. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-011#25:1> This quote is taken from William Wordsworth's " Preface to

Lyrical Ballads"
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#26:1> This work explained his <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> Coleridge's

view of how poetry should be written, the role of the poet, and other

important information concerning poetry that changed our view of the process

of writing poetry <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> what we call poetry.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#27:1> This quote is significant because it sums up the Romantics view in a

line.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#28:1> <del> The </del> Wordsworth feels that poetry should <del> come

</del> flow from your emotions, not the rigid form of the <}> <->

neo-classists </-> <+> neo-classicists </+> </}> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#29:1> He felt that inspir <l> ation came from nature, which overwhelms the

poet so much that when he returns to the urban world he can recall the event

and freely write about it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-011#30:1> This is a quote from William Shakespeare's play, " The Tempest".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#31:1> This line is spoken by Ariel, an air sprite, to <del> Fernando </del>

Ferdinand <del> who </del> to convince him that his father Alonzo is dead.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#32:1> It is significant because it sums up what Prospero wants all of the

characters to go through - <quote> a sea change </quote> - in order to come

to understand their wrong doings in life.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#33:1> What is meant by a <quote> sea change </quote> is that in order to be

reborn into something greater, you must die, figuratively.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#34:1> Ariel says that Alonzo's eyes are pearls and his bones are now coral.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#35:1> From death comes new life <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear>

</del> , understanding, and greater ( better) things. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-011#36:1> This famous quote is taken from John Donne's poem " The Flea".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#37:1> It is significant because it shows a metaphysical conceit - which in

turn, sums up the speakers argument.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#38:1> Donne compares marriage ( something from the macroworld) to a flea (

something from the microworld).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#39:1> This is typical of a metaphysical conceit, as it is an unlikely

comparison of dissimilar things that is diminishing.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#40:1> It also shows the intellectual wit of the poet as he argues that

since the flea has bitten both the speaker <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}>

his lover, their blood is joined, and therefore, they are married in this

church of a flea.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#41:1> His argument is to convince his lover that they shouldn't wait, they

should have sex now, since they are already married. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-011#42:1> This is taken from Alexander Pope's " The Rape of the Lock".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#43:1> It is significant because it provides the reader another woman to

identify with, one who aids the 'rape'.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#44:1> Therefore, the rape is justified as this woman clearly agrees with

the Baron, so <del> the </del> Belinda must be over <l> reacting.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#45:1> This is key because the poet aligns the reader on her side, because

we want to be 'in on the joke'.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#46:1> We don't want to be laughed at, like Belinda.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#47:1> Clarissa aids the Baron, and in doing this justifies the rape. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-011#48:1> This quote is taken from Christina Rossetti's " Goblin Market".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#49:1> It is significant because it reasserts the strong bond between Laura

<}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> Lizzie.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#50:1> The ending of the poem may seem to be contradictory because both

girls marry <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> have children; thereby filling

the traditional female role.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#51:1> But, these concluding lines emphasize the importance of the

relationship between two women, as the husbands aren't mentioned, or relied

upon.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#52:1> The moral of the poem is in these lines; don't depend on men, you

should depend on your sister. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-011#53:1> This quote is from the movie " Forbidden Planet".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#54:1> Even though the author didn't intend to, he created a movie that very

closely parallels Shakespeare's " The Tempest".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#55:1> The significance of the line is that it's <quote> the monster from

the id </quote> - the unconscious desires that are suppressed in all of us -

that is causing all of the deaths on the planet.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#56:1> The Krell were an advanced civilization <del> that </del> which

Morbius was <del> f </del> learning <del> from their </del> how to have

higher use of our brains.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#57:1> This quote solves the mystery of the movie.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#58:1> It is the beast in all of us that destroys the Krell <}> <-> & </->

<+> and </+> </}> is destroying the planet. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-011#59:1> Dramatic monologue is a literary device that was made famous by

Robert Browning.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#60:1> There are three key concepts <del> th </del> to this literary device.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#61:1> The first is that the speaker speaks in first person in a voice that

is distinctively not the author.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#62:1> It is 'dramatic'; there is a context to which the poem starts

<foreign> in medias res </foreign> - already in action.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#63:1> The speaker speaks to a silent auditor, who is the second element to

the dramatic monologue.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#64:1> The listener doesn't speak, but we can infer their actions from <del>

what </del> the speaker's reactions.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#65:1> The third concept to the dramatic monologue is that there is an

unintentional revelation of the speaker's character.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#66:1> We learn something about them, that perhaps they did not want us to

know, from inferences drawn from the text.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#67:1> A clear example of this would be Browning's " My Last Duchess".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#68:1> We immediately see these three key elements.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#69:1> We see that the speaker is clearly distinct from Browning; he is a

duke in Renaissance Italy.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#70:1> The poem does begin <foreign> in medias res </foreign> - there is a

dramatic context that has already begun.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#71:1> The silent auditor is a man from the Estate of a family who wants

their daughter to marry the Duke.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#72:1> His ( the listener) actions influence the duke's <del> <unclear>

unclear word </unclear> </del> monologue.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#73:1> This second element is clearly illustrated in another dramatic

monologue, John Donne's " The Flea".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#74:1> Here, the listener's actions effect <del> o </del> the outcome of the

poem <}> <-> <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> </-> <+> and </+> </}> the

course of the speaker's argument.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#75:1> The element of unintentional revelation is <del> <unclear> unclear

word </unclear> </del> seen in " My Last Duchess".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#76:1> The Duke presents himself as an art connoiseur, a man of fine taste.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#77:1> But, through <del> the </del> his words, <del> <unclear> unclear word

</unclear> </del> especially those in the parentheses <del> ) </del> , we see

that he is a <}> <-> possesive </-> <+> possessive </+> </}> , <del>

<unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> sly man who knows <ul> exactly </ul>

what he's doing <}> <-> <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> </-> <+> and </+>

</}> saying.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#78:1> He presents a humble man, unaware of what is happening, but we learn

that he knew <del> all too well </del> what happened ( or what he <ul>

thought </ul> happened) <}> <-> <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> </-> <+> and

</+> </}> he knows how to bait this other family into not letting it happen

again.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#79:1> It was his possessive desire to control his wife that led him to

murder her.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#80:1> He can now control her, as she is an object - a work of art <del>

<unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-011#81:1> Conrad's quote exemplifies the attitude taken by many writers in

many periods, toward women.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#82:1> The concept of there being <del> a </del> specific worlds for women,

and specific worlds for men is characteristic of a belief in inferiority and

superiority of the sexes.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#83:1> Women are inferior and men are superior.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#84:1> This notion of high <}> <-> <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> </-> <+>

and </+> </}> low is demonstrated in several works.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#85:1> During different periods ( specifically, the Renaissance, the 19th

century, and the 20th century) different approaches are taken, but the same

result is achieved.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#86:1> Women are belong </del> in a lower space.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#87:1> It is only in the 20th century <del> w </del> that we begin to see a

way out of that low space. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-011#88:1> During the Renaissance, the typical way of portraying women was

through the Petrarchan sonnet.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#89:1> This traditional mode is seen in Sir Philip Sidney's " Astrophil and

Stella", a very <del> tip </del> typical sonnet sequence.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#90:1> We see the attitude towards women in certain conventions.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#91:1> The first convention is seen in the title of this work, which means

star-gazer and star.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#92:1> Immediately, the convention of man gazing upon the unattainable woman

is seen.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#93:1> The convention that men were the victims of the <del> se </del>

chaste, pure unattainable woman shows typical attitudes toward women.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#94:1> It would seem that the male poet, Sidney, is elevating his female

love object.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#95:1> He does this through conceits.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#96:1> But, Petrarchan conceits compare on a one-to-one physical level.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#97:1> By doing so, as we saw in Sidney's blazon of comparing Stella to a

house, the woman remains an object to be looked at.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#98:1> While the male poet pines <del> at </del> about <quote> the fire of

his desire, and the ice of her chastity </quote> ( Norton Intro.), he remains

the subject - the 'I' - that has control over the 'you' - the object.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#99:1> He claims that the woman has power over him - by her great beauty, he

is rendered slave, - but, in fact he has power over her, because he is in

control of the gaze on the object.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#100:1> This attitude that women are so beautiful and unattainable actually

serves to oppress women, as they are reduced to roses and stars - physical

objects that should be gazed upon by men. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-011#101:1> This oppositional mode of thinking is seen in works during the

19th century.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#102:1> The notion of high and low is evidently seen in Alfred, Lord

Tennyson's " The Lady of <}> <-> Shallott </-> <+> Shalott </+> </}> " .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#103:1> This poem is typical of the Victorian era.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#104:1> There is a return to the myths of medieval romances that portray

women as 'damsels in distress'.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#105:1> The attitude is that women need men to come <del> get </del> save

them.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#106:1> This poem <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> takes

traditional assumptions and <del> assumes </del> makes it clear that the

reader recognizes them and makes the right association.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#107:1> Men are associated with light, culture, and superiority, which the

reader is supposed to <del> c </del> see as good.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#108:1> Women, on the other hand, are associated with dark, domesticity,

docility, and inferiority.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#109:1> These clues show that women are bad and need to be saved by the

good.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#110:1> The Lady of Shalott is associated with <quote> grey towers </quote>

and <quote> shadows </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#111:1> While <del> the </del> Sir Lancelot is seen as <quote> glimmering

</quote> , <quote> bright </quote> , and <quote> light </quote> <del> ,

</del> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#112:1> This attitude Tennyson takes toward women is that they should remain

in their own sequestered spaces. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-011#113:1> The fact that these oppositional modes rely on the inferior to

keep the superior, superior is seen in Virginia Woolf's " A Room of One's

Own".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#114:1> In this work, which is a compilation of two addresses she made to

groups of young women, Woolf explores what she calls a <quote> looking glass

identify </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#115:1> She states that in order to keep men feeling superior, they make

women inferior.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#116:1> The same is seen in Conrad's <ul> Heart of Darkness </ul> ( as

exemplified in the quotation in the question) with women and <del> race

</del> racial inferiority.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#117:1> The top needs the bottom to hold itself up.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#118:1> Woolf goes on to say that patriarchy, man's control over woman, is

in all of us.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#119:1> We feed off of it like drug addicts off their heroine.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#120:1> Without it we would fall, and our whole notion of culture would be

destroyed.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#121:1> Without the bottom, <quote> the centre will not hold </quote> as

Yeats said.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-011#122:1> <X> As Woolf acknowledges this, she goes on to offer a solution.
