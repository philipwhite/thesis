<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-070#1:1:A> Thank you my lord uh <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#2:1:A> If I may <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#3:1:A> Well I <?> have <?> <&> could be 'had' </&> a <,> actually <?> I'll

do </?> this first I think
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#4:1:A> Uh in response to the Crown <,> and the Crown's position and if I

may I'd like to suggest that <,> if I listen to the Crown's <,> theory and

the Crown's position on this quite frankly my lord it is indeed a tale well

told but a tale nonetheless
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#5:1:A> And <,> there's some fundamental problems that <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#6:1:A> I'm not <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> take much of your

time
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#7:1:A> I'm <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> take about fifteen

minutes of the time in responding because <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> made

a great number of notes and <,> I wanted to be sure that I totally understood

<,,> the position of the matter
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#8:1:A> I think I do
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#9:1:A> And <,> I know that of course that we're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+>

going to </+> </}> overlook all the hyperboles
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#10:1:A> The law and <unclear> word </unclear> <@> Springfield </@> and the

<,> <?> second and </?> cash related <unclear> word </unclear> aren't

particularly important to us <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#11:1:A> Which is more that what the evidence has told us
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#12:1:A> There's one fatal flaw my lord in the Crown's whole theory and it's

this
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#13:1:A> It's that the Crown says that they're not relying on one overall

<?> progenous </?> plan in effect
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#14:1:A> But as I listen <&> could be 'listened' </&> to my friend very able

submission very articulate submission
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#15:1:A> There's absolutely no doubt that this is one overall <?> progenous

</?> plan
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#16:1:A> And the problem though <}> <-> is </-> <=> is </=> </}> as follows
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#17:1:A> There are <,> seven or eight <,> as you will've noticed significant

time points on the time chronology that Mr <@> Kent </@> has forward <,> for

you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#18:1:A> At each of those times there comes a point where Mr <@> Luthor </@>

</I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-070#19:2:A> Such as tools for breaking into a house <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#20:2:A> Or they may act as a lookout <,> ready to warn the others of the

approach <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#21:2:A> Or they may assist the principal offender <,> by being there <,>

and helping them <,> <}> <-> in </-> <=> when </=> </}> they are committing

the offence <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#22:2:A> You therefore must decide whether the act <,> of <@> Matthew </@>

aided <,> either <@> Roger </@> or <,> <@> Peter </@> in the extent of

assistance <,> helping <,> facilitating or making it easier for either <@>

Roger </@> or <@> Peter </@> <,> to commit the offence of sexual assault <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#23:2:A> You can find that <@> Matthew </@> 's conduct aided either <@>

Roger </@> or <@> Peter </@> even if either <@> Roger </@> <?> and </?> <@>

Peter </@> could've committed the offence <,> without <,> his act
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#24:2:A> It is sufficient that <@> Matthew </@> 's conduct assisted <,>

facilitated or made it <,> easier for the <?> offence <?> to be <?> offended

</?> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#25:2:A> Now I'm just <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> very briefly

touch on the evidence which <,> you must consider <unclear> word </unclear>

whether or not the Crown has proved that <@> Matthew </@> did something <,>

and that act aided <@> Roger </@> or <@> Peter </@> to commit the offence of

sexual <,> assault
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#26:2:A> And you first of all <unclear> word </unclear> I mentioned earlier

you have to consider his evidence he denied the count
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#27:2:A> <?> If you accept that evidence <?> or you have a reasonable doubt

then he has to be acquitted including <unclear> five or six words </unclear>

<?> one of them convicted </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#28:2:A> But the evidence of the Crown is <@> Sarah </@> said that the

accused <,> <@> Matthew </@> came into the bedroom <,> and on one occasion

<,> pulled her legs apart
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#29:2:A> <?> She said that once </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#30:2:A> But in cross-examination she said she <,> thought <,> it was <@>

Matthew </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#31:2:A> On another occasion she said <quote> he tried to grab <,> my legs

<,> and pull them apart <,> but I wouldn't let him </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#32:2:A> So you have <,> slightly different versions <,> going through all

that evidence
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#33:2:A> And of course you have <,> <@> Matthew </@> 's evidence where he

denies that that happened <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#34:2:A> I should also emphasize that <?> both </?> aiding <,> means more

than just standing by and watching someone commit an offence <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#35:2:A> Mere presence at the scene of an offence is not sufficient to make

a person <,> an aider
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#36:2:A> An onlooker is not an aider unless he or she actually encourages

<,> or does something to help <,> criminal offence
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#37:2:A> Therefore in order to prove the second element the Crown must prove

beyond a reasonable doubt that <@> Matthew </@> <,> did something and that

act actually aided <,> <@> Roger </@> <}> <-> and <@> Peter </@> to commit

</-> <=> or <@> Peter </@> to commit </=> </}> the offence of sexual assault
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#38:2:A> The third element the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is

that <@> Matthew </@> intended <,> to aid <@> Roger </@> or <@> Peter </@> to

commit <?> the </?> offence of sexual <,> assault <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#39:2:A> Now in this case <,> there is evidence <unclear> word </unclear>

<,> that either <,> <@> Roger </@> <,> or <@> Peter </@> personally committed

the offence of sexual assault <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#40:2:A> Now you might be satisfied insofar as <@> Matthew </@> is concerned

<,> <}> <-> that </-> <=> first of all <,> <}> <-> that </=> </}> either </->

<=> </}> I want to emphasize this that either </=> <@> Roger </@> or <@>

Peter </@> <,> committed <,> the offence <,> and that <@> Matthew </@>

assisted <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#41:2:A> For either <,> then you must convict <,> both of them
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#42:2:A> They are equally guilty regardless of which one was the actual

perpetrator and which one was the aider or abetter
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#43:2:A> But again I <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> emphasize that

if you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt <,> that <@> Matthew </@>

aided either <,> of these two accused as I have defined it for you then you

must <,> find <,> not <,> guilty
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#44:2:A> Now ladies and gentlemen of the jury <,> this is a very serious

charge <,> and you have very solemn <,> duties and responsibilities
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#45:2:A> You have a duty to the Crown and you have a duty to all <unclear>

five or six words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#46:2:A> You have taken an oath to try the charge on the evidence without

<?> either </?> fear or favour <,> and surrender <,> a true verdict <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#47:2:A> <unclear> two or three words </unclear> <,> you will have performed

your duties <,> fully
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#48:2:A> Now in closing I want to leave this message with you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#49:2:A> You've heard me say this over and over again and I'll mention it

one <,> last <,> time
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#50:2:A> That every ingredient necessary to sustain the charge against each

of the accused <,> must be proved by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#51:2:A> With respect to each ingredient every ingredient there's no

obligation on the accused whatsoever
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#52:2:A> Now when you go into that jury room <,> I want you to read them

together <,> and use your good old-fashioned common sense and take whatever

time you need <,> to reach your verdict <,> until you are all each and every

one of you satisfied <?> with it </?> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#53:2:A> If you have any questions I want you to put them in writing <,> and

give them to the foreperson <,> that you have chosen
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#54:2:A> He's in charge of the jury
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#55:2:A> And <,> that writing will be drawn to my attention
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#56:2:A> Then I'll spend some time considering questions <?> with which you

need </?> help <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#57:2:A> I'll review them with counsel and then I'll call you back
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#58:2:A> And I'm quite prepared to deal with the questions and any other

problems that you may have <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#59:2:A> If anything I have said to you is unclear or <?> you wish </?>

further instructions <,> do not hesitate to ask
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#60:2:A> Now when you leave I'm going to ask the court counsel here <,>

whether I've understated or overstated or simply made a mistake <,> in

respect <?> of </?> my charge
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#61:2:A> And it may well be that I will call you back for further directions

<,> after I <?> 've </?> <,> canvassed <,> all court counsellors
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#62:2:A> If I do that there may be a danger that you will place too much

emphasis on what I say at that time <,> than what I just told you <}> <-> in

in in </-> <=> during my </=> </}> address
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#63:2:A> Please don't do that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#64:2:A> Should I recall you you must consider what I say in the light of

what I'm <}> <-> <?> telling </?> </-> <,> <=> saying to you </=> </}> now
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#65:2:A> With that ladies and gentlemen of the jury I'm going to ask <}> <->

the </-> <,> <=> the </=> </}> sheriff's officer <,> <?> to swear <?>

<unclear> one or two words </unclear> <?> that he's going to </?> be

responsible <,> for your care
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#66:2:A> Thank you very much and <,> go ahead and try to <unclear> five or

six words </unclear> </I>

<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#107:3:A> I'd also like to deal <,> for a short moment here with the

of common sense but rather <,> dealing with the differences in the Crown's

evidence <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#109:3:A> The majority <,> of the Crown's witnesses <?> ladies and gentlemen

</?> to varying degrees <,> had consumed quantities of alcohol of various

kinds

a good time
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#120:3:A> Look how much drink between nine and ten and they were going <?>

to realize it </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#121:3:A> You've heard the evidence of <@> Tim Makinski </@> of <@> John

time <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#123:3:A> Now <,> it does not take medical evidence <,> to convince <?>

people <?> that consumption of alcohol has <?> many </?> effects on the mind
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#124:3:A> Firstly it dulls the memory

<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#126:3:A> Secondly it affects your perception of what's going on around you

</unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#128:3:A> The concept of time and place actually become <?> warped </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-070#129:3:A> Thirdly <,> you become less inhibited <,> than you were when you
