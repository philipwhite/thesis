<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#1:1> RICK BOWERS
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#2:1> <h> Dental Bytes </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-014#3:1> I can still see Dad, biting on bloodied handkerchiefs, begging us

boys to brush our teeth and avoid his miser <l> able fate, urging Mom to

marry again after his death and be happy.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#4:1> His uppers had been pulled ear <l> lier that same afternoon while I

struggled with fractions in Math class, wished that I was old enough to drive

and maybe take Miss Brimley out camping.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#5:1> A week before, Dad's lowers had been pried out of their sockets while

I considered the fiery torment of Father Brebeuf in History class, wondered

why Miss Brimley, always smiling in freshly coiffed hairdos, big blazers, and

tight skirts above the knee, looked so much more beautiful than Mom.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#6:1> But looking back, I guess Miss Brimley was probably fifteen years

younger than I am now.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#7:1> Mom was probably my age.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#8:1> Thirty-nine.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#9:1> Besides, Mom had me and Jim to contend with when she wasn't working at

the snack bar.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#10:1> No wonder she looked used by the years, her face bitten in terseness

as she rolled her eyes at my father's lamentations, told him to act like a

man in front of his sons. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-014#11:1> My abscessed bicuspid really pulsates up into my ear, pumping

slowly with morbid significance.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#12:1> I look in the mirror and observe the swelling.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#13:1> My lower right mandible bulges out as if I were chew <l> ing a squash

ball.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#14:1> But I don't really feel involved in the discomfort.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#15:1> I feel as though I were someone else observing me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#16:1> Dad's ruined mouth, by contrast, must have felt pretty immediate to

him: like an arm ripped off or an open sucking wound of the chest wall.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#17:1> His face looked crashed in.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#18:1> Furious in his distress until tired by his rigors, Dad moaned a

couple times through the night, inhaling deeply, muttering <quote> " Jesus,

Jesus Christ almighty" </quote> in his sleep.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#19:1> Miss Brimley drew our attention to sucking wounds of the chest wall

in Health class once.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#20:1> She said we were to cover the site with a plastic bag or something

and call an ambulance.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#21:1> I wanted so badly for her to demonstrate mouth-to-mouth artificial

respiration on me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#22:1> Miss Brimley's mouth was shapely, drawn into a full cherry-ripe smile

with gorgeous red lips and white teeth.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#23:1> My lips are dry, my tongue a little shredded where I bit it under

local anaesthetic.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#24:1> And now that the freezing is wearing off, my mouth throbs like a

voice from the steaming dark.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#25:1> The codeine seems to rob me of emotional reaction, but the pain

remains. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-014#26:1> I don't usually live in a great deal of pain.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#27:1> I'm an associate professor of English, with full dental coverage, on

study leave at 80 per cent of my salary.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#28:1> My work during sabbatical involves the cultural rehabilita <l> tion

of Renaissance polymath Thomas Phaer, a physician, lawyer, <smallcaps> mp

</smallcaps> , and general man of letters in sixteenth-century England.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#29:1> Big deal.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#30:1> Obscure.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#31:1> Nobody's life depends on it.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#32:1> But I guess my sabbati <l> cal project represents a further particle

of knowledge to be con <l> tributed to the study of the Humanities.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#33:1> No one else will do it if I don't.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#34:1> Oh, my aching head.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#35:1> Besides, I firmly believe that knowledge for its own sake is

valuable.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#36:1> Such academic faith rescues me from more immediate and intolerable

considerations: my childishness, my <w> child <it> less </it> ness </w> , my

uncomfortable sense that life is rapidly pass <l> ing me by as I twiddle my

thumbs and envy the accomplishments of others.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#37:1> Some real pain comes as almost a relief, a reminder that there <it>

is </it> a world elsewhere of involvement and interaction, a world where

surprise can enter the heart like a pickaxe through the chest. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-014#38:1> I observe my face in the mirror once more, bare my teeth and feel

a jet in my mouth.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#39:1> The teeth themselves feel as though they have been chewing on tin

foil.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#40:1> I watch my fingers explore along the whiskery ridge of my misshapen

jaw, wonder at the pain of toothache prior to twentieth-century dentistry.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#41:1> In a section of his 1544 medical text titled " <}> <-> Breedynge </->

<+> Breeding </+> </}> of teeth," Phaer writes: <quote> " And wh[e]n the

peyne is greatte and intollerable with aposteme or inflammation of the

gommes, it is good to make an oyntmente of oyle of roses with the juyce of

morelle, otherwyse called nyght <l> shade." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#42:1> Roses and deadly nightshade - the ancients knew best how to appease

pain and all its symbolism.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#43:1> They treated pain with the mercilessness of love.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#44:1> Today, we think we can counteract pain with drugs.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#45:1> I squeeze my eyes shut, and a hum of sad choirboys tunes up in the

back of my head.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#46:1> Alto-tenors predominate.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#47:1> My tongue pro <l> trudes and I can see myself breathing on the

mirror.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#48:1> It wearies me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#49:1> I remember things. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-014#50:1> In grade five, Miss Brimley always smiled at me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#51:1> A girl-woman, tall and curvaceous, she used to put her hand on my

shoulder during Art class.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#52:1> " Use any colours you want, John," she said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#53:1> " You have a flair for colours."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#54:1> The other teachers were trolls.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#55:1> Mom, by contrast, was a <}> <-> worn-out </-> <+> worn out </+> </}>

woman who didn't like colours all that much.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#56:1> She was always tight-lipped and angry about Dad, about the world.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#57:1> " Make you sick!" was her response to everything.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#58:1> " John, clean up that mess," she'd say.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#59:1> " Make you sick!"
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#60:1> Or, " John, why did you have to go and do that.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#61:1> Make you sick!"
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#62:1> On weekends, she'd sit back in her sofa chair, exhale cigarette smoke

to the ceiling, complain to her friends: " Did you see the makeup she was

wearing?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#63:1> Make you sick!
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#64:1> And the colours &dotted-line; oh my!"
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#65:1> Mom's friends all wore pants with zippered sides that never quite

closed.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#66:1> They traded magazines back and forth, magazines that advertised a lot

of bras.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#67:1> The back cover of the magazines always showed a man and woman dancing

cheek-to-cheek.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#68:1> <quote> " To herself: He forgets I am 50." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#69:1> By now, somewhere, Miss Brimley is well over 50 years of age.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#70:1> I touch my swollen face, cup <l> ping the bulge of my jaw in the palm

of my hand.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#71:1> I'll leave off shav <l> ing until tomorrow.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#72:1> Sometimes I really do feel sick. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-014#73:1> Last night, I saw an advertisement on TV for a face cream that

pur <l> ported to <quote> " reverse the aging process." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#74:1> The model - fabulously blonde, slim-nosed, slight waisted, and leggy

under a luxurious blue <}> <-> terrycloth </-> <+> terry cloth </+> </}> robe

- held the product up to her face for a full-frame closeup and declared:

<quote> " <it> You </it> have the choice." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#75:1> This was during a baseball broadcast, for God's sake.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#76:1> My choices, I feel, are severely limited.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#77:1> Interviewed on a syndicated talk show, fashion writer Angela Veno

commented as follows: <quote> " A successful model need only be a standard

size 8, five-foot-nine or over, have good skin and hair, and both front

teeth." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#78:1> Her humour seems lame to me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#79:1> I felt an ache in my jawline, reached for the channel selector,

thought about more codeine.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#80:1> But then I froze as the commercial for the age-rever <l> sal cream

was repeated.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#81:1> The model looked to be the spitting image of Loreena, my teenage

sweetheart.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#82:1> Was there a technical slip up?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#83:1> Was the commercial aimed at a male viewing audience?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#84:1> Dear God, was it aimed at me?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#85:1> I've got to get out more.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#86:1> Either that, or lose this aching tooth.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#87:1> My head feels as though it's closing.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#88:1> If I thought for a moment that reversal of the aging process was

possible, I would buy stock in the company.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#89:1> As an associate professor, I make enough to do so.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#90:1> I'm fully insured, without children, on double income with my spouse,

looking at mutual funds, and spending very little on entertainment.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#91:1> Pathetic. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-014#92:1> Pain is relative and subjective.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#93:1> A threshold of emotionality is involved.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#94:1> Dr Trudy Brydges, my dentist, inquired about the nature of my pain,

urging me to specify whether it was a sharp, piercing, localized sensation or

a more generalized dull, throbbing ache.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#95:1> This confused me momentarily.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#96:1> Using the hand mirror which she provided, I pointed daintily with my

pinky finger at the howling tooth in question.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#97:1> She performed a percussion test, knocking against the specified tooth

with the handle of a dental instrument.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#98:1> My head exploded.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#99:1> All confusion left me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#100:1> Jagged spikes of purple and orange shot out of my ears into the

waiting room where they overheard Paula, Dr Trudy's receptionist, complaining

about Greg.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#101:1> " He's such a baby," she said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#102:1> My forehead ridged itself down my face.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#103:1> " Are you okay, John?" asked Trudy.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#104:1> I nodded, exhaling aro <l> matic rocky boulders, my face rattling

like a stack of sharpened tin forks.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#105:1> A whiff of iodine wobbled in my sinuses and I felt myself crawling

up the back of the chair. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-014#106:1> During recess once, while playing sidewalk soccer, I scraped my

knee off.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#107:1> It oozed orange and red and it watered down my shin.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#108:1> Eyes closed, I sucked air that tasted like rust and <}> <->

crab-apples </-> <+> crabapples </+> </}> .
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#109:1> Miss Brimley asked me " Are you okay, John?"
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#110:1> Her look of concern was as beautiful as her smile.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#111:1> She smiled fully at me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#112:1> She placed both hands on my shoulders.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#113:1> Then she took me to the <w> teachers' </w> lounge, washed the grit

out of my wound.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#114:1> " This iodine will sting you, John," she said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#115:1> But I didn't mind so long as Miss Brimley was there, was speaking to

me with sympathetic apprehension.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#116:1> In fact, I had never felt better in my life than I did right then,

alone with Miss Brimley in the <w> teachers' </w> lounge, gritting my teeth,

playing the brave soldier, living by her attentions.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#117:1> Miss Brimley placed a cold cloth on my forehead, told me to lean

back on the couch, said that I could stay in the room as long as I liked

until I felt better.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#118:1> I then remember sniffing a little in sweet torment as she sat with

me, hugged me to her on the couch.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#119:1> She smelled like candy and flowers.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#120:1> Her body felt large and comforting and soft.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#121:1> She hummed a little, hushing me gently and assuring me that I would

be all right.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#122:1> I clung to her, didn't risk moving a muscle in case it might lead to

rearrangement or loss of contact. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-014#123:1> Mr Peacock, our surly principal, arrived a little later to drive

me to the hospital in his car.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#124:1> His teeth were perpetually tobacco-stained and grimy.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#125:1> I never liked him.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#126:1> He jovially parted me and Miss Brimley, made light of my resistance.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#127:1> But he seemed genuinely con <l> cerned too, accompanying me to

outpatients without comment.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#128:1> All I could think of, as my knee crusted over, was the special

relation <l> ship between Miss Brimley and me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#129:1> My eyes misted in remembrance at the smooth feel of her hand in my

hair and around the back of my neck.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#130:1> Nobody else in class ever received such treatment.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#131:1> My pain was pleasure so long as I could close my eyes and see her

smiling face. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-014#132:1> The debonair Elizabethan courtier Sir Philip Sidney wrote a poem

entitled <quote> " When His Lady Had Pain In Her Face," </quote> and it made

me reflect upon Elizabethan dentistry and the pleasing pain of love in a

sonneteer's mind.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#133:1> Love, love, the pain of love I seek.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#134:1> Hand me the pliers.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#135:1> This, just after Dr Trudy's hygienist, Kayla, placed a book of

Garfield cartoons on my lap.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#136:1> Concerned and well-meaning, Kayla offered, " Perhaps this will help

a little?"
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#137:1> Her every utterance is a tentative offering, her voice rising

musically: " Hi.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#138:1> My name's Kayla?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#139:1> Looks like you're going to have &dotted-line; a root canal?"
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#140:1> I feel cranky and doubtful.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#141:1> Garfield cartoons?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#142:1> I teach English Literature at the uni <l> versity, goddammit.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#143:1> Not that I'd like to peruse essays on <it> Hamlet </it> in my

current painful condition ( although one or two of my more vaguely crazed

colleagues probably would), but some form of read <l> ing matter above the

grade five level would be welcome.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#144:1> When in grade five, I watched Miss Brimley's captivatingly fresh

face and beautiful white teeth and was immune to everything else.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#145:1> I was better then. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-014#146:1> Dad confided to me once that he never felt young again after he

got his dentures.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#147:1> This was on the morning of my first communion.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#148:1> Just moments before he had confessed his atheism to me as he knotted

my necktie.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#149:1> I wondered to myself if dentures and loss of faith were somehow

connected.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#150:1> Years later, a dentist in Hamilton, Ontario, checking me over for a

possible stint with CUSO <&> Canadian University Service Overseas </&> ,

complimented me on the general condition of my teeth.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#151:1> I told him that my mother always believed in the maxim <quote> " bad

teeth, bad peo <l> ple." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#152:1> " Smart woman," he intoned without a trace of irony as he adjusted

the lamp above my face.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#153:1> By then, I had privately amended Mom's line to <quote> " bad teeth,

poor people," </quote> and felt certain that my dentist, with his red BMW and

crisp Arrow shirts, must have had some notion of the economic side of the

inequation. </I> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#X154:1> Even dental coverage proves expensive.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#X155:1> A colleague of mine at the English Department once advised me, "

Just think <mention> 'orthodontist' </mention> and be thankful that you and

Beryl don't have any kids."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#X156:1> She added that the very word <mention> " orthodontist" </mention>

made her feel old.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#X157:1> Bitten by her own mortality, I guess.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#X158:1> That dentist back in Hamilton informed me as follows: " As we age

our gumlines recede and are subject to increased sensitivity."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#X159:1> As we <it> age </it> ?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-014#X160:1> I heard it from him first. </p> </X>
