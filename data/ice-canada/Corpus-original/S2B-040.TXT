<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#1:1:A> India is one of the most active markets for wind power in the

world today
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#2:1:A> According to the Worldwatch Institute by early nineteen ninety-six

India had installed enough wind turbines to generate seven hundred and thirty

megawatts of power
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#3:1:A> That makes India the third largest producer of wind energy in the

world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#4:1:A> More than fifteen hundred wind turbines have been installed since

the Indian government opened up the electricity grid to independent power

producers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#5:1:A> In the early nineteen nineties India enacted tax incentives for

renewable energy investments
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#6:1:A> One of the benefits of new wind technology is power production can

be combined with agricultural production in some areas
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#7:1:A> For example according to the Worldwatch Institute a hectare of

Kansas prairie that yields about four hundred dollars worth of wheat can also

produce ten thousand to twenty-five thousand dollars worth of wind generated

electricity each year
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#8:1:A> In Alberta legislation enacted in nineteen eighty-eight allocated a

hundred and twenty-five megawatts of electricity production to alternative

energy producers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#9:1:A> To date however only one hundred and eight megawatts have been

allocated to wind hydro and biomass electrical power generation projects in

Alberta
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#10:1:A> That's despite the fact that small power producers say they have

enough proposed facilities to generate a hundred and fifty-three megawatts of

power
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#11:1:A> If Alberta were to reach its goal of a hundred and twenty-five

megawatts the province would still be generating only one point five percent

of its energy from alternative sources
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#12:1:A> That's it for this week's Ecofacts and Trends

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#14:2:A> I first heard about Doctor <@> Dan Lowe </@> while studying

forestry at the University of Alberta
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#15:2:A> From other professors it was clear that <@> K Dan Lowe </@> was a

forest ecologist of some note
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#16:2:A> He wrote <@> Forest Places of Canada </@> the textbook describing

Canada's forest ecosystems
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#17:2:A> But much more than that <@> K Dan Lowe </@> is an ecologist in the

true sense of the word
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#18:2:A> He's a man who spent considerable time thinking about how things

work in an ecosystem or global context
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#19:2:A> When I began work on a magazine about Canada's wilderness and

ecology <@> K Dan Lowe </@> was an advisor stopping on every word to clarify

hidden meanings and questionable ecological assumption
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#20:2:A> Today <@> K Dan Lowe </@> is a retired professor of ecology living

in New Denver British Columbia
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#21:2:A> It's been seven years since he wrote his landmark book entitled <@>

Our Place </@> in which he analyzes humanity's place in the world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#22:2:A> Then a month ago a colleague sent me an email note complete with a

photograph taken just a day or so earlier
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#23:2:A> The picture was of <@> K Dan Lowe </@> getting arrested blockading

a logging road in the Slocan Valley near New Denver British Columbia <O>

interview between A and extracorpus speaker, 9 min 50 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#24:2:A> Doctor <@> Dan Lowe </@> is a retired professor of ecology and

an author of books and numerous essays on ecological thinking
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#25:2:A> He believes that jobs are still the ticket to the political banquet

known as power but that political strategies without ecological foundations

will eventually collapse in on themselves
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#26:2:A> If you're interested in this topic he suggests several books
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#27:2:A> The Case Against the Global Economy edited by Jerry Mander and

Edward Goldsmith
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#28:2:A> The other book is The Way An Ecological Worldview also by Edward

Goldsmith
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#29:2:A> You're listening to the Chevron Ecofile
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#30:2:A> Now here are this week's Ecofacts and Trends </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#31:3:A> Ever paused to think about where that stuff you just poured

down the drain goes <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#32:3:A> That's the idea behind Trout Unlimited Yellow Fish Road program <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#33:3:A> Volunteers usually school children or Guide and Scout groups paint

yellow fish on all of the storm drains in their area <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#34:3:A> The idea is to get people thinking about what goes down the drain
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#35:3:A> <@> Jay Stanway </@> of Trout Unlimited says in the past people

have put everything from turpentine to car oil and paint down the drain
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#36:3:A> The yellow fish is a reminder to people that fish and other

creatures live in the rivers and that we also depend on those same rivers and

streams for clean drinking water <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#37:3:A> What goes down the drain goes into the river
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#38:3:A> Since the program began in nineteen ninety-one Trout Unlimited

estimates that across Canada more than sixty thousand storm drains have been

painted and seven hundred thousand homes have been reached with the

educational Yellow Fish Road door hangers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#39:3:A> The educational message is simple
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#40:3:A> Whether you're washing the car or cleaning around the house use

non-toxic products whenever possible
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#41:3:A> For information on the Yellow Fish Road program contact Trout

Unlimited in Calgary at one eight hundred <@> nine zero one two zero four

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#44:4:A> The sight of a clear-cut is enough to bring tears to the eyes

of many environmentalists
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#45:4:A> <mention> Clear-cut </mention> has become synonymous with <mention>

moonscape </mention>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#46:4:A> When people think of a clear-cut forest they think of vast seas of

stumps open areas devoid of wildlife and subject to erosion
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#47:4:A> Doctor <@> Dan Lowe </@> is not a fan of clear-cut logging although

he believes the controversial method is somewhat misunderstood by the public

and what the public must do is step beyond clear-cuts and look at the bigger

picture of forest management
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#48:4:A> <@> Dan Lowe </@> is now in his late seventies <,> a forest

ecologist who wrote the textbook on Canada's forest ecosystems
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#49:4:A> And most recently he's known as the author of <@> Our Place </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#50:4:A> He grew up in Alberta and now lives in New Denver British Columbia

where he's fighting plans to clear-cut the Slocan Valley near his home
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#51:4:A> I asked him about clear-cutting forests

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#52:4:Z> <O> speech, 2 min 30 sec </O> <O> question and answer between

A and Z, 6 min </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#53:4:A> Doctor <@> Dan Lowe </@> is a respected forest ecologist
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#54:4:A> He lives in New Denver in the Slocan Valley in British Columbia
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#55:4:A> Next week we'll find out about alternatives to clear-cutting from

Doctor <@> Dan Egan </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#56:4:A> He's a biologist from the University of Alberta who now heads up a

research program on forest ecosystem management for Alberta Pacific Forest

Industries

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#59:5:A> The Prince Edward Island Nature Trust is using caution signs

to help save endangered piper plovers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#60:5:A> In a province with very little natural habitat left to protect

signs and armies of volunteers are a good way to help these beach-loving

birds
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#61:5:A> <@> Mary Goodale </@> of the Island Nature Trust says piping plover

numbers are down again this year
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#62:5:A> She estimate the P E I population at only sixty birds
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#63:5:A> That's down from sixty-five last year and forty percent down from

just five years ago <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#64:5:A> Piping plovers depend on cobbly beaches for their nesting habitat

and this unfortunately puts them at odds with beach-loving humans <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#65:5:A> Inside P E I National Park piping plovers receive protection and

they seem to be doing very well
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#66:5:A> <@> Goodale's </@> group tries to help the piping plovers outside

the national park <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#67:5:A> With some money from the federal government and World Wildlife Fund

and many volunteers the Nature Trust patrols beaches and erects temporary

signs around nests
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#68:5:A> They cannot legally prevent people from walking through nest areas
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#69:5:A> They instead try to educate and ask for voluntary assistance in

protecting the plovers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#70:5:A> Unfortunately the numbers of piping plovers in Atlantic Canada are

still declining <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#71:5:A> <@> Goodale </@> says endangered species legislation more

volunteers and steady funding are needed to save the endangered piping plover

<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#74:6:A> Least-cost logging that's how ecologist Doctor <@> Dan Lowe

</@> defines clear-cutting
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#75:6:A> As we heard last week on the Chevron Ecofile he believes forest

companies must begin practising more sustainable methods of logging
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#76:6:A> That's exactly what Alberta Pacific Forest Industries is trying to

accomplish in north-eastern Alberta
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#77:6:A> The company harvest aspen from the boreal forest to make pulp
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#78:6:A> But instead of clear-cutting the company's launched a massive

long-term experiement in ecosystem management of the forest
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#79:6:A> This includes leaving clumps of trees and woody debris on the

cutblocks to help maintain the biodiversity of the area
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#80:6:A> Doctor <@> Dan Egan </@> is a biologist and an adjunct professor at

the University of Alberta who now heads up the environmental research team

for Alberta Pacific
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#81:6:A> He explains this new approach is one that attempts to emulate

natural disturbance regimes

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#82:6:Z> <O> speech, 1 min 45 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#83:6:A> You can easily see the difference between Al-Pac's cutblocks

and those of other companies
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#84:6:A> As Doctor <@> Dan Egan </@> points out research has lead to the

development of different methods of logging

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#85:6:Z> <O> speech, 1 min </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#86:6:A> Generally government rules dictate that all merchantable trees

that is those that are of a size and quality that can be sold must be removed

from a cutblock
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#87:6:A> Hence the clear-cuts
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#88:6:A> So Al-Pac is going against the grain by leaving merchantable timber

on its cutblocks in the interest of maintaining biodiversity
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#89:6:A> According to Doctor <@> Dan Egan </@> on average that amounts to

about eight percent of the merchantable volume on a cutblock

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#90:6:Z> <O> speech, 1 min 25 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#91:6:A> Doctor <@> Dan Egan </@> believes it will take <}> <-> <.> t

</.> </-> <=> fifteen </=> </}> to twenty years before science can give a

definitive answer on this new method of logging
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#92:6:A> However he recognizes it's unrealistic to expect forest companies

to stop logging while the scientists do their research
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#93:6:A> So the main concern becomes one of adapting forest management

techniques as new information comes to light

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#94:6:Z> <O> speech, 50 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#95:6:A> As Doctor <@> Egan </@> is quick to point out <,> no one can

be complacent
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#96:6:A> The scientists must be looking for warning signs that the

experiment is going off-track
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#97:6:A> Also there are issues like global climate change which can effect

the forest ecosystem

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#98:6:Z> <O> speech, 1 min 5 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#99:6:A> Moving from the world of academics to that of industry has

been a major step for Doctor <@> Dan Egan </@>

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#100:6:Z> <O> speech, 25 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#101:6:A> Doctor <@> Dan Egan </@> is a biologist and adjunct professor

at the University of Alberta
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#102:6:A> He is also Environmental Sciences Research Coordinator for Alberta

Pacific Forest Industries

Trends </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#105:7:A> Rising grain prices may be the first global indicator that

tells us we are on a path that is not sustainable
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#106:7:A> For almost fifty years grain prices have declined as productivity

has steadily increased
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#107:7:A> That all came to an end in nineteen ninety-four when wheat prices

began rising soaring thirty-nine percent over three years <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#108:7:A> That's according to <@> Wilfred Grey </@> of the Worldwatch

Institute
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#109:7:A> <@> Grey </@> says the reason grain production is slowing down has

to do with the deterioration of the Earth's ecosystem <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#110:7:A> This may not immediately effect affluent people <,> but for the

one point three billion people who live on a dollar a day or less <@> Grey

</@> says such a rise in price could be life threatening
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#111:7:A> Eventually Third World political instability could affect

multinational corporations the stock markets and the international monetary

system
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#112:7:A> In short it could disrupt economic progress worldwide <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#113:7:A> According to <@> Wilfred Grey </@> achieving a balance between

food and people depends as much on family planners as on farmers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#114:7:A> Also decisions made in energy departments that could affect

climate stability may have as much an effect on food security as decisions

made in agriculture departments
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#115:7:A> That's it for this week's Ecofacts and Trends

<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-040#117:8:A> When I was in university <,> I took several courses in

outdoor recreation and parks management
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#118:8:A> One of the central concepts of Leisure Studies at the time was

that technology would eventually create so much leisure time there'd be a

never-ending demand for parks and recreation managers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#119:8:A> As of today I now count eight months as the sum total of time I

spent working on my parks and recreation career
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#120:8:A> And even that is stretching it somewhat <,> since all of that time

was spent working as a photographer and not a manager for Alberta Provincial

Parks
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#121:8:A> I worked ten days on and four days off
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#122:8:A> I was on what they called flex time
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#123:8:A> That meant no one punched a clock and no one looked over your

shoulder to see if you worked thirty-seven and a half hours a week
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#124:8:A> It actually worked out very well and my less than scientific

observation was that most people were keen and probably worked longer hours

than they were paid for
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#125:8:A> So what happened to increasing leisure time
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#126:8:A> How many people do you know have more leisure time and are not

unemployed
<ICE-CAN:S2B-040#127:8:A> Today we'll talk to author and activist <@> Jim Hanley </@> about

a culture that's not only sustainable they have more than twenty-three hours

a day for sleep and leisure </I>
