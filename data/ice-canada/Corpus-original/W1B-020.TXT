<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#1:1> To whom it may concern: </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#2:1> I have known <@> Graeme McEwan </@> since the fall of 1988.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#3:1> I met <@> Graeme </@> when I was working in youth ministry at the <@>

Doug MacDougall </@> United Church in <@> <}> <-> St. </-> <+> Saint </+>

</}> Patrick </@> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#4:1> I have watched <@> Graeme </@> mature from a very intriguing and

interesting adolescent to an equally fascinating yet productive and mature

young adult. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#5:1> <@> Graeme </@> possesses a depth of character that is most

refreshing.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#6:1> His artwork, his humour and his ease with conversation are all strong

indicators of the depth and richness of his character. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#7:1> I have always known <@> Graeme </@> as a diligent student with a

work ethic that many could learn from.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#8:1> He has also consistently shown himself as a person with great

sensitivity and compassion for all those he meets.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#9:1> I fully expect the post secondary milieu will be a place where he can

truly flourish. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#10:1> <@> Graeme </@> 's teenage years have provided him with the

opportunity for travel, unique learning situations and a number of work

settings.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#11:1> I have witnessed him making the most of all these opportunities. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#12:1> I wish him the best and offer him God's blessings in whatever he

takes on as his next challenge. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#13:1> Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions on

what you must surely receive as an unambiguously positive reference. </p>

<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#44:3> Dear Secretary, </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#45:3> I am writing this letter in order that you can bring the concerns

of the United Church's <@> Green Lake </@> before your Annual General Meeting

or equivalent of your Pastoral Charge / Congregation and respond to the camp

before February 28th, 1995. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#46:3> The camp has many reasons to celebrate: There is a small but very

dedicated core of people who love the camp and passionately believe in its

mission; the physical property retains its beauty and has been augmented by

successful building projects in the last four years; the camp has a healthy

stable of horses; investment in youth leadership has produced an enthusiastic

group of junior counsellors; this is one of the few tangible ways our church

reaches out to youth and children; the committee has an openness to God's

voice and is ready to consider change in the future. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#47:3> The camp also has real concerns: The camp committee members are

few in number and very tired, the physical distance and other challenges have

contributed to a lack of a real sense of ownership on behalf of the

congregations and outreach ministries of <@> King Albert </@> and <@>

Regional </@> Presbyteries; Congregations are not supporting the camp!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#48:3> The camp has had operating deficits during the last few years and is

drawing upon accumulated funds from logging revenue that was marked for

capital improvements and also appears to have been exhausted as a resource.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#49:3> The camp wants to provide you with an opportunity to make your

feelings and willingness to support the camp known.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#50:3> As such, we ask that you bring the attached questionnaire before your

Annual General Meeting and reply to the camp before February 28th, 1996.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#51:3> Please take time to consider the letter before that date and if you

are in need of clarification contact myself or the Camp President, Ms. <@>

Lynn Stone </@> , <O> address </O> or by phone <@> 1-800-445-7735 </@> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#52:3> IF YOU DO NOT RESPOND, WE WILL BE FORCED TO ASSUME THAT YOU HAVE

NO PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE MINISTRY OF THE CAMP.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#53:3> Please take this request seriously.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#54:3> Please take time to strategize, perhaps including the questionnaire

in your annual report so that your response is both considered and helpful.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#55:3> Thank you, <@> Ken Garrison </@> <@> King Albert </@> Presbytery

delegate to the committee </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#56:4> <h> TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#57:4> It has come to our attention that <@> Benjamin Button </@> and

<@> Anna-Belle Dumont </@> will be married this forthcoming summer in a Roman

Catholic service in New Brunswick. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#58:4> We are very pleased to hear of the celebrations planned and

delight with them in the occasion. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#59:4> <@> Benjamin </@> is a member in good standing of the United

Church of Canada and we support him in his freedom to be married in whatever

church he and <@> Anna-Belle </@> feel is appropriate. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#60:4> May God be with them in the day of celebration and long years of

matrimony to follow. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#61:4> Regards, Rev. <@> Ken Garrison </@> </p> </I>


<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#62:5> Dear <@> Bob </@> , </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#63:5> I am sorry I didn't find you in the office when I phoned about a

month ago.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#64:5> You were away doing a training event for ministry of supervision.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#65:5> Again, I want to affirm your calling to that all important ministry,

I often reflect on your great help to me.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#66:5> Since that call, I received both a newsletter from <@> Locality </@>

and a personal letter from <@> Clark Gable </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#67:5> We were greatly saddened to hear about <@> Rod Barker </@> 's death.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#68:5> You might recall that we spent some wonderful time with him and have

kept in touch regularly ever since.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#69:5> No doubt he will be well missed by the <@> Locality </@> family.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#70:5> I'd like to share some thoughts with you that I trust you find an

appropriate way to share with the congregation ... many of whom, no doubt,

are new since my time there. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#71:5> There was a movie out a few years ago called " Six Degrees of

Separation."
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#72:5> The title comes from a theory that everyone on the globe is connected

by " six degrees."
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#73:5> Put another way, everyone in the world is at least a friend of a

friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#74:5> I found this to be the most comforting of ideas ... it somehow makes

the world seem smaller, more friendly and caring.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#75:5> I like to think that I am still connected to <@> Locality </@>

congregation, even as I am involved in a part of the world far away both

geographically and in many other ways.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#76:5> I like to think this letter as being something that will bring each

of us closer to our " neighbours." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#77:5> I wanted to talk to you about The Healing Fund, the fund our

church is building to help address the profound hurt that is the unfortunate

legacy of the Residential School system in which our church participated.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#78:5> While some of the Roman Catholic legacy around such schools is all

<}> <-> to </-> <+> too </+> </}> well known, our own United Church

participation has been less well documented.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#79:5> There are some excellent resources available from <@> James Hobart

</@> at Church House; I hope you can make use of them if you don't already

have them.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#80:5> Among those is a 25 minute interview with <@> Jimmy Greenriver </@> ,

whose wedding I will be conducting this coming October 12th.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#81:5> Some good print resources that are nicely laid out and to the point

are also available. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#82:5> As you know, I am the ordained minister in <@> Smalltown </@> ...

a traditional <@> Smalltonian </@> village in northern B.C. along the highway

from Prince George to Prince Rupert near the larger community of <@>

Middleton </@> , B.C.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#83:5> Many of the people who I work with are in need of the healing that

this fund is hoping to support. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#84:5> Yes, many folks were able to get an education that they may not

have otherwise had and some were taken away from homes that were quite

threatening.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#85:5> But everyone who attended those schools was deprived of learning

their own culture and language and of having any reason to value their own

traditions.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#86:5> And while not all suffered the atrocities of physical and sexual

abuse that are now coming to light, the honest truth is that such things were

not uncommon.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#87:5> The people spoken of in the material put out by the church are the

people I work and minister with each day. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#88:5> This year is the tenth anniversary of the apology to First

Nations made by our church.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#89:5> I like to think that every step of the ministry that I do is taken

with that apology in mind.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#90:5> As such, finding a role in the healing journey of those who went to

the schools and their children and even their children's children is part of

my everyday life.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#91:5> In short, residential schools were not great places for learning

parenting skills and that impacts on the communities now. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#92:5> Money doesn't heal but the programs being created to facilitate

that healing cost money.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#93:5> Your support is both needed and greatly appreciated. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#94:5> I recognize that there are many pressures on limited financial

resources of each individual and that substantial support may not be possible

for all.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#95:5> If that is the case, rest assured that your attention to and prayers

for the work going on here and throughout many other First Nations

communities is also of great value. </p>

<p> Again, Thanks for your attention! <@> Ken Garrison </@> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#96:5> P.S. Feel free to make use of this letter in which ever way you

choose: simple encouragement, read as a " minute for mission", a bulletin

insert, include in the newsletter or whatever helps you do what you are

trying to do. </p> </I>


<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#97:6> Dear Dr. <@> Newman </@> , </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#98:6> At a recent meeting of the Pastoral Care Committee of the <@>

Welch </@> hospital we discussed the August visit of Dr. <@> Cam Watson </@>

to our community.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#99:6> Those who were able to meet with him were very thankful for the

opportunity.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#100:6> He was entertaining, informative and passionate about his teaching.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#101:6> As convener of the Pastoral Care Committee, I have been asked to

write a letter to formally acknowledge the work done by both you and <@> Dora

</@> in bringing <@> Cam Watson </@> here and in promoting his workshops in

the community.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#102:6> Your work is well appreciated. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-020#103:6> The pastoral care committee well recognizes the benefits of a

hospice society.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#104:6> However there are two blocks in the path to the formation of one in

<@> Smalltown </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#105:6> One concern is that the <@> Smalltown </@> house system and some

initiatives of the Health Authority already meet many of these needs for a

great portion of the community.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-020#106:6> The other is that in spite of a number of people who have shown an

interest to date, interestingly an overwhelming number from the Seventh Day

Adventist Church, we have not had many people with particular gifts of

administration step forward with the time or inclination to do the ground

work of forming a society or the ongoing administrative work of matching

volunteers with those who could use services. </p> </I>
