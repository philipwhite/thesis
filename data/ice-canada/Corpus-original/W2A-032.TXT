<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#18:1> <h> <bold> Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#19:1> Detailing requirements for steel concentrically braced frames

subjected to seismic design loads are incorporated in the 1989 edition of the

CSA standard for limit states design of steel structures, CAN/CSA-S16.1-M89 (

CSA 1989).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#20:1> These provi <l> sions are coupled to those of the 1990 edition of the

National Building Code of Canada ( NRC 1990), which identifies three

categories of concentrically braced frame: ductile braced frames, braced

frames with nominal ductility, and frames for which no special provision is

made to ensure ductile behaviour. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#21:1> The anticipated behaviour of these three categories is as

follows: </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#22:1> ( <it> i </it> ) Ductile braced frame ( DBF): inelasticity will

be largely confined to the braces, with beams also capable of some inelastic

action
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#23:1> Large ductile deformations in the braces are provided for.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#24:1> Columns are expected to remain essentially elas <l> tic under the

loads induced by yielding braces.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#25:1> The braces may yield in tension and compression.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#26:1> Design provisions are directed at ( a) limiting framing

configurations to those that can main <l> tain stability when some

inelasticity occurs in the braces, ( b) providing some redundancy, ( <it> c

</it> ) ensuring brace ductility by controlling overall and local buckling,

and by providing for adequate connection resistance, and ( d) ensuring

adequate resistances of beams and columns and their connections when braces

yield. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#27:1> ( <it> ii </it> ) Braced frames with nominal ductility ( NDBF):

yielding of braces may occur, but large ductility demands need not be

provided for
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#28:1> No significant yield is anticipated elsewhere in the frame.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#29:1> Ductility design requirements are directed at provi <l> sion of brace

sections that can undergo limited amounts of inelastic straining in

compression or develop the yield load in tension, and at corresponding

connection design.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#30:1> Beams and columns and their connections must provide resistances ade

<l> quate to support the brace-induced loads. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#31:1> ( <it> iii </it> ) Braced frames with no special provision for

ductility ( SBF): principally elastic response is anticipated.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#32:1> Local inelas <l> ticity may occur, but complete cross-section

yielding is unlikely.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#33:1> The design of these frames is based on traditional require <l> ments

for strength and stiffness.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#34:1> Since these requirements do not exclude brittle details, for example,

in brace connections or in column splices, the specified loading ( NRC 1990)

is quite severe.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#35:1> By eliminating the possibility of such details by com <l> plying with

case ( <it> ii </it> ) , a significantly lower design load is decreed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#36:1> Three eight-storey braced frames, each corresponding to one of

these categories, have been designed according to S16.1-M89 and the 1990

National Building Code, and are described in some detail by Redwood and

Channagiri ( 1991).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#37:1> These and other designs are examined in this paper.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#38:1> The struc <l> tures are subjected to a number of earthquake ground

motion records, and the resulting responses are analyzed and com <l> pared

with the expected behaviour. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#39:1> <h> <bold> Design procedures </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#40:1> The example building structure comprises two exterior moment

resisting frames in one direction, and two braced bays in the other, these

being located in the core area.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#41:1> The building layout is shown in <}> <-> Fig. </-> <+> Figure </+>

</}> 1 and is based on a study by Chien ( 1987) of a building not subjected

to earthquake loads.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#42:1> The design procedures for seismic loading are outlined in detail by

Redwood and Channagiri ( 1991). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#43:1> The ductile braced frame design, corresponding to category ( <it>

i </it> ) , will be considered first and is shown in <}> <-> Fig. </-> <+>

Figure </+> </}> 2 <it> a </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#44:1> Seismic load <l> ing corresponds to that for Victoria, B.C.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#45:1> The frame was first designed for strength and stiffness in the usual

way and was then modified to satisfy the requirements for ductile braced

frames given in Clause 27.2 of CSA ( 1989).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#46:1> In carrying out the design, a number of assumptions were made which

will be examined in the light of the analytical results presented herein.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#47:1> These assumptions were as follows: </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#48:1> ( a) Brace connections will usually be designed to carry the full

tensile yield load of a brace; however, CSA ( 1989) per <l> mits lower loads

in some cases.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#49:1> These are intended to deal with overstrength members, selected to

satisfy stiffness require <l> ments, for example.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#50:1> Thus, for a ductile braced frame, when twice the seismic load, plus

the specified gravity load, is less than the brace yield load, the lower load

may be used for design.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#51:1> This load is approximately equal to the load that the brace would

carry if the frame was being designed as the third category of structure,

that is, without special provisions for ductility.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#52:1> For the braced frame with nominal ductility, the load is 1.33 times

the seismic load, plus the gravity load, which also brings the load to

approximately the same level as for the third category of structure. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#53:1> In view of the importance of these connections for the struc <l>

ture to perform as assumed, there may be some reluctance to design the

connections for less than the brace yield load.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#54:1> The brace connections for the frame shown in <}> <-> Fig. </-> <+>

Figure </+> </}> 2 <it> a </it> were assumed to resist the full brace yield

load.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#55:1> The effect of using loads less than the tensile yield load will be

examined in the light of the analytical results for another braced frame in

which connec <l> tion resistance less than the full yield load was assumed.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#56:1> ( b) Axial loads induced in the columns by the yielding of

overloaded braces must be added to the specified gravity loads to obtain the

design loads for columns under the severe seismic load condition.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#57:1> Because of the low probability of all braces being overloaded

simultaneously, a column in a lower floor need not be designed to carry the

sum of the maximum brace loads induced at each higher floor.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#58:1> For the subject designs, the loads in any column due to braces were

taken as the maximum loads induced at any level above the column considered,

plus the square root of the sum of the squares of all other brace-induced

loads above that level.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#59:1> The validity of this combina <l> tion rule will be examined herein.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#60:1> ( c) Yielding of braces leads to redistribution of the horizon

<l> tal shear carried by the braces, which then leads to a change in load

carried by beams forming part of the lateral load resist <l> ing system.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#61:1> Depending on the bracing configuration, some beams have no axial

forces induced under lateral load until brace yielding occurs.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#62:1> The assumptions used to estimate these loads for the beam design will

also be examined.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#63:1> These assumptions significantly influence the design of the short

beams, i.e., those supported at their centre by the intersecting braces, and

are described in detail by Redwood and Chan <l> nagiri ( 1991). </p> <O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#64:1> For comparative purposes, in addition to the DBF design shown in

<}> <-> Fig. </-> <+> Figure </+> </}> 2 <it> a </it> , other designs were

produced for the same structural configuration and also for the Victoria,

B.C., loca <l> tion ( Channagiri 1990).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#65:1> A braced frame with nominal ductility, NDBF, corresponding to

category ( <it> ii </it> ) and designed according to Clause 27.5 of CSA (

1989) is shown in <}> <-> Fig. </-> <+> Figure </+> </}> 2 <it> b </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#66:1> Again, it is assumed that brace yield loads are transmitted to the

other members. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#67:1> Figure 2 <it> c </it> shows a design based on category ( <it> iii

</it> ) , that is, one for which no consideration of ductility has been

given.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#68:1> It should be recognized that, by virtue of Sentence 4.1.9.3(1) of NRC

( 1990), the latter design would not in fact be permitted in Victoria, B.C.;

nevertheless, it provides a useful compari <l> son, since it should

correspond to very limited ductile behaviour. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#69:1> Parallel to these designs, three braced frame designs were also

generated for the location of Montreal, thus incorporating the effects of a

significantly lower seismic-to-gravity load ratio.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#70:1> These designs are shown in <}> <-> Fig. </-> <+> Figure </+> </}> 3.

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#73:1> The dynamic analysis was performed using the program DRAIN-2D (

Kannan and Powell 1973), modified to include bracing elements ( Jain and Goel

1978).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#74:1> Assumptions made for the analysis corresponded to those on which the

design was based, and may be summarized as follows: — columns and braces are

pin-ended, and are without lateral support between floors; — effective length

factors of 1.0 are used for all columns and braces; — beams are simply

connected to the columns, and in those floors where they intersect the

braces, the beam is continu <l> ous through the intersection point; beams are

laterally sup <l> ported. </p> <O> Diagram </O> <O> Figure 2 caption </O> <O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#75:1> Gravity loading equal to the specified dead and live loads was

applied to the structures throughout the imposed earth <l> quake excitation

histories.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#76:1> These loads impose initial compres <l> sions in columns and braces

and tensions in some beams.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#77:1> Specifics of the gravity loads are given by Redwood and Chan <l>

nagiri ( 1991). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#78:1> The DRAIN-2D program carries out nonlinear time-history analysis

of two-dimensional frame structures.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#79:1> Mass is lumped at nodes; viscous damping with both mass and stiffness

depend <l> ence was incorporated, and was assumed to be 5% of critical for

the highest and lowest modes.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#80:1> Constant acceleration is assumed in each time-step, and equilibrium

corrections are made by applying corrective loads in the succeeding

time-step.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#81:1> Fundamental periods of the structures analyzed lie in the range 1—1.7

s ( the structure of <}> <-> Fig. </-> <+> Figure </+> </}> 2 <it> a </it>

had periods of 1.47, 0.51 0.37, 0.28, and 0.22 s for the first five modes),

and an integra <l> tion time-step of 0.02 s was therefore assumed.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#82:1> The total integration time used in the analysis was 30 s for each

earth <l> quake record.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#83:1> P-&DELTA; effects were approximated by including a geometric

stiffness based on the element axial force under static load ( Kannan and

Powell 1973). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#84:1> A primary purpose of the analysis was to determine if the

structures could be expected to perform as assumed in their design.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#85:1> For the DBF, the primary interest was to determine if the beams and

columns would indeed remain elastic if the braces yielded.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#86:1> Thus for this structure, beams and columns were modelled as elastic

elements, and only braces were modelled as yielding elements.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#87:1> If beams or columns then proved to be overloaded, the extent of

overload would provide a guide to selection of a section with the necessary

increased capacity.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#88:1> The same modelling is appropriate for the NDBF, whereas for the SBF,

a fully elastic model would be adequate if the basic design assumptions were

valid.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#89:1> However, the braces were modelled to exhibit nonlinear hysteretic

behaviour for this structure also. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#90:1> The resistance of yielding elements used in the analysis and the

resistances of members used to compare with the analytical results were based

on their most probable values, i.e., the nominal values with the resistance

factor <O> mathematical symbol </O> = 1.0. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#91:1> The brace members were modelled as " buckling elements," denoted

EL9 by Jain and Goel ( 1978).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#92:1> This is a multi-linear hysteretic model which may yield in tension or

buckle in com <l> pression.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#93:1> An example of the hysteretic behaviour modelled by this element is

illustrated in <}> <-> Fig. </-> <+> Figure </+> </}> 4.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#94:1> The buckling load in the first cycle, <it> C </it> <sb> u </sb> , is

equal to the unfactored axial compressive resistance of CSA ( 1989).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#95:1> In subsequent cycles, a reduced compression resistance, <it> C <sp> |

</sp> </it> <sb> u </sb> , applies, the amount of reduction being based on

empirical data ( Jain 1978).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#96:1> The load versus deflection path followed as the brace compression is

reduced and loading becomes tensile is a function of loading history, and is

based on empirical results.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#97:1> The point A ( Fig. 4) is deter <l> mined by <it> C <sp> | </sp> </it>

<sb> u </sb> and the compressive displacement occurring since the last load

reversal.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#98:1> Point B indicates the degree of pinching and is related to the

slenderness ratio, and point C is a function of residual displacements.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#99:1> The element does not model local buckling, and thus the deformations

predicted by the analysis must be critically examined in relation to the sec

<l> tion width-to-thickness ratios provided. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#100:1> Columns were modelled as elastic truss elements, and beams as

elastic beam — column elements, in view of the large axial forces expected

when braces yield
<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#101:1> Because beams were considered to be laterally supported by floor

slabs, only their yield behaviour, and not buckling, is modelled. <O> Table 1

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-032#104:1> For the structure located in Victoria, earthquake records from

<ICE-CAN:W2A-032#X105:1> Some of these same records were used for the Montreal structures,

in view of the lack of strong motion records for eastern Canada, and, in

addition, the Saguenay earthquake of 1988 was also considered. </p> </X>
