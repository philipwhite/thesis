<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#1:1:B> But uhm <,> <}> <-> it </-> <=> there </=> </}> was no question

of panic
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#2:1:B> <}> <-> We uh </-> <=> we </=> </}> made it eventually <unclear>

words </unclear> up
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#3:1:B> I don't know where the money came to fix the brakes but we somehow

managed to scrape it together <,,> <{> <[> and </[> made it home in one piece

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#4:1:A> <[> Hmm </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#5:1:A> Do you know something interesting that uhm <,,> why we slide into

the past like this
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#6:1:A> Uh uh you start out looking at these two photographs <,> all of the

sudden we're way way back in the past
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#7:1:A> <?> It has nothing to do with what </?> we're talking about

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#8:1:B> Marriage abandonment <,,> where we are now <,> is because of

where we were then

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#9:1:A> Well what are you <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> do

now

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#10:1:B> I'd like to say I have a wonderful masterplan but I <,> am

waiting for some sorts of inspiration with <}> <-> writing </-> <=> my

writing </=> </}> and

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#11:1:A> Well why do you have to have inspiration

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#12:1:B> I'd like to be tremendously excited about one <,> project I

can just throw myself into <,> and the most logical idea for that would be a

book being a big project

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#13:1:A> A book of what

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#14:1:B> Well the book of essays is still a possibility and uhm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#15:1:A> <unclear> words </unclear>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#16:1:B> By what you call my vintage <@> Anne-Marie </@>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#17:1:B> And <,,> I thought I had more <,> words together than <,> I do

although I haven't <,,> precisely counted them up
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#18:1:B> But <@> Chloe </@> said I <,> have to have at least forty thousand

<{> <[> words </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#19:1:A> <[> How </[> </{> much

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#20:1:B> At least forty thousand that would be bottom end

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#21:1:A> Uh that's bottom

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#22:1:B> And uhm well the idea is that uhm because publishing is in

such <}> <-> short </-> <=> sorry <,> shape </=> </}> uh that publishers are

starting <}> <-> to produce <.> s </.> <.> s </.> </-> <=> will produce

smaller books </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#23:1:B> But <}> <-> seventy is more </-> <=> seventy thousand is more

ballpark </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#24:1:B> So when I started adding up the <,> number of stories I had I got a

little <,,> taken back

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#25:1:A> And how many <}> <-> <.> d </.> </-> <+> do </+> </}> <}> <->

how </-> <=> how </=> </}> many do you have

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#26:1:B> <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> <}> <-> didn't </-> <=> didn't

</=> </}> add it up but it'd be uh twenty or twenty-five that I could <,> put

together

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#27:1:A> As many as that

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#28:1:B> Ya <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#29:1:B> But didn't you say <}> <-> that </-> <=> that </=> </}> <,> with

visual artists once they finish something <,> they're irritated with it
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#30:1:B> They want to almost push it away and not look at it

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#31:1:A> Ya

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#32:1:B> And I found that when I was going through some of the stories

I felt well yes it's <,> reasonably written and <,> has interest I suppose

uhm but I don't like it anymore
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#33:1:B> I don't like the theme or it seems too melancholy it seems too

self-indulgent
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#34:1:B> You know <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> critical voice that

starts <,> and so that <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> want something fresh

that I can begin with
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#35:1:B> I don't want any <}> <-> <.> A </.> </-> <=> <@> Anne-Marie </@>

</=> </}> in agony stories

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#40:1:B> We do it very well <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#41:1:B> We just need to write about it

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#42:1:A> Well can't you manufacture it

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#43:1:B> Manufacture bliss

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#44:1:A> Ya

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#45:1:B> Not really

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#46:1:A> Well I mean do you have to <,,> be blissful to write about

bliss

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#47:1:B> Actually no
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#48:1:B> <}> <-> I'm <unclear> word </unclear> </-> <=> <@> Suzie </@> and I

had <,> an interesting conversation about that because blissful writing is

<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#49:1:B> Uhm <}> <-> it's <,> </-> <=> <O> laugh </O> no it's true </=> </}>

<O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#50:1:B> It's like that dreadful <,> radio interview that uh <@> Chloe </@>

and I had to go through for C B C <,> and the woman interviewer kept circling

back to give us blood give us guts give us how incredibly neurotic you are
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#51:1:B> And we said we're not neurotic
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#52:1:B> We have healed
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#53:1:B> We do love
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#54:1:B> We are <,> entirely functional loving human beings
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#55:1:B> And she found that about as interesting as a <,> lemon meringue pie

recipe
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#56:1:B> Uhm <,> we had to fight <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#57:1:B> <}> <-> that was </-> <=> did we tell you about what a disaster

that was </=> </}>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#58:1:A> No

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#59:1:B> No
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#60:1:B> Absolute resisting
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#61:1:B> Obviously the interviewer's very capable and articulate and

forceful <,> and it was like pushing that rock up the hill
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#62:1:B> Uhm <@> Chloe </@> and I were seated across from one another and we

kept looking <,,> to huh one another for <,,> support and resisting resisting

resisting this notion that <,> one event or one person or many events and one

person had ah irreparably harmed us
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#63:1:B> We said no <,> and that answer was not accepted
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#64:1:B> <}> <-> And uhm </-> <=> so </=> </}> we came out of forty-five

minutes or perhaps it was even an hour <,> of interview feeling as though

we'd run a twenty-five mile marathon
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#65:1:B> But actually quite pleased with ourselves too because <,> had we

felt less conviction <,> about our <,> mental and emotional and spiritual

health <,> uh we wouldn't have been as forceful in resisting her ideas
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#66:1:B> So we felt <,> good about that <,,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#67:1:A> Well the problem with that you know uhm
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#68:1:A> Let's hope <,> that thing can be laid to rest
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#69:1:A> You know that that death can be <,,> accepted now and <,> you know

I mean and quite frankly <}> <-> the <,> </-> <=> the </=> </}> death of <@>

Kim </@> has managed to get a fair amount of mileage you know <{> <[> <,>

</[> from the point of view <,> of uh literature

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#70:1:B> <[> Yes </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#71:1:A> And uh I hope now that uh her spirit can be buried <}> <-> and

<,> uh </-> <=> and </=> </}> written about anymore </=> </}>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#72:1:B> Well I agree

write too much more about that </=> </}> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#74:1:B> Well this is our first pause <,,> in twenty or so minutes

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#75:1:A> Well I was thinking about <,,> <}> <-> those </-> <=> those

</=> </}> deaths in the family you know <,,> never really fade
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#76:1:A> You know you can never forgive self and forgive <,,> other people

that we're not committed to forget
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#77:1:A> That's the one thing that took me <,> a long long time to

understand
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#78:1:A> Cos <}> <-> it <,,> </-> <=> for </=> </}> myself anyway

forgiveness is mandatory I mean even forgiving myself <{> <[> <?> you know

you know </?>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#81:1:B> Well if I take nothing away from this particular visit it's

going to be <,,> live one day at a time underscored so <,> heavily <,> again
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#82:1:B> That's what I'm going to do too

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#83:1:A> <unclear> word </unclear> you know I had <,> <}> <-> a </->

<=> some </=> </}> difficulty yesterday with <,> <@> Anson </@> and <@>

Camille </@> talking about that
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#84:1:A> He really doesn't understand it

<@> Mendela </@> that beautiful <,> millionaire meatpacker from <,> Saskatoon

who was so nice to me when I was a young man <,,> and I was talking to him

one day and <,,> I asked him about plans and so forth and he'd be about my

age now about seventy <,> and he said you know mister <@> Samson </@> we

don't worry about the future we just wake up <}> <-> in praise at the <}> <->

<.> f </.> </-> <+> fact </+> </}> </-> <=> in the morning </=> </}> praising

the fact we're still alive
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#86:1:A> You know
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#87:1:A> Uhm <@> Anson </@> just didn't understand that emphasis of that

point
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#88:1:A> I said I behave as if <}> <-> <.> is this is </.> </-> <+> this

might be </+> </}> the last day of my life <,> and I try to <,> uhm <unclear>

word </unclear> <?> and dry </?> <,> in terms of what I've experiences that

<?> you </?> <,> and try to put some of it into a spiritual system
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#89:1:A> He simply can't understand <,> the lack of planning for the morrow

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#90:1:A> He's actually unable to understand
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#91:1:A> He said but you must have a plan

</}> read or think otherwise it'd be nihilism
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#95:1:A> It isn't

preface </?> you know <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#97:1:A> When you're old you have no idea how long you're <}> <-> gonna </->

<+> going to </+> </}> live and you have to grab onto what you've got <,,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#98:1:B> Well I think I said to you yesterday too that <,> an ability

of <,> his to understand is uhh <,> based to me on spiritual differences

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#99:1:A> <{> <[> Uh what do you mean </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#100:1:B> <[> Uhh </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#101:1:B> Well this stance of one day at time via A A <}> <-> and and </->

<=> and </=> </}> other influences is a spiritual <,> philosophy <,> because

it <,,> asks of you to give your very best in each moment
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#102:1:B> And that moment being the immediate one

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#103:1:A> Ya <}> <-> it's </-> <=> it's </=> </}> spiritual but very

<,> pragmatic too
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#104:1:A> I mean <,,> you have no control over yesterday
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#105:1:A> That's gone finished
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#106:1:A> Now <,> is <,,> all of <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> uh

implications of what you did yesterday will live on
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#107:1:A> You have a clue what's <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}>

happen tomorrow <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#108:1:A> You really you don't have a clue
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#109:1:A> <}> <-> You have </-> <=> you hope </=> </}> that certain things

will materialize but you do not know
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#110:1:A> So what are you left with
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#111:1:A> You're left with today it's exactly what you're left with
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#112:1:A> And <,,> if I do a fairly decent job today <,> if I <,> am around

tomorrow to experience it <,> it will make it easier
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#113:1:A> I know that
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#114:1:A> But I <,> have a heritage <}> <-> of </-> <=> of </=> </}> discord

</-> <+> going to </+> </}> be difficult

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#115:1:B> So his concerns stemmed from <,> the idea that you're not <,>

really looking after yourself

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-009#116:1:A> Not planning for the future
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#117:1:A> <}> <-> I </-> <=> I'm </=> </}> not concerned with the future
<ICE-CAN:S1A-009#118:1:A> I'm only concerned with <,> today
