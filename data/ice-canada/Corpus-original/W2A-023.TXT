<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-023#3:1> Americans may best remember 1973 for the night their president

appeared on television to accept responsibility for the Watergate scandal.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#4:1> Canadians may recall it as the year world oil prices quadrupled in

response to declining production by members of the OPEC cartel.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#5:1> Still others may recollect it most vividly for the event that

precipitated that embargo, the outbreak of war in the Middle East.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#6:1> In time, though, much of the world may come to remember it best for

two relatively uncelebrated men, Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen, and a

nameless grey toad.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#7:1> That year, in a relatively short and characteristically undramatic

article in the scientific press, the California researchers described an

experiment in which they had stitched together a DNA molecule from parts of

two dis <l> tinct species - a toad and a bacterium - and inserted it into a

living bacte <l> rial cell.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#8:1> Though hardly a classic scene of impending revolution, their

experiment marked the beginning of a fundamental shift in humanity's

relationship to the organic world.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#9:1> Boyer and Cohen had become the first people to engineer an entirely

novel form of life. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-023#10:1> Though the public could not have been expected to fathom it then

- and indeed has yet to appreciate it fully - the pair's cryptic account

placed at technology's disposal the basic mechanism of heredity.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#11:1> Humans had taken control of the molecular code that commands

biological growth and regeneration, and with that achievement has come the

potential to combat some of the world's most pressing problems.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#12:1> The products of so-called genetic engineering - hardier and higher

yeilding crops, more pro <l> ductive livestock, new vaccines, organisms that

extract oil and minerals from the earth, and bugs that gobble waste - promise

deliverance from hunger, disease, environmental decay, and declining energy

resources.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#13:1> Not to mention relief from a host of more benign aggravations: soon

we may produce vegetables that ripen on the vine without going soft, coffee

plants with naturally decaffeinated beans, and <quote> " super pigs" </quote>

that yield low-fat pork. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-023#14:1> Yet along with the hopeful prospects, the Boyer-Cohen experiment

also succeeded in bringing to the forefront a litany of profound questions

about the risks of applying this new technique to humans and the environment.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#15:1> While the chemical industry began to dream of crops with greater

resistance to herbicides and pesticides, some consumers began to challenge

the scant knowledge available about the toxicity of these chem <l> icals.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#16:1> While other consumers began dreaming of flawless fruits and vegeta

<l> bles, some farmers began to wonder about the ability of uniform crops to

withstand genetic diseases.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#17:1> While other farmers dreamed of microbial treatments to protect

seedlings against frost and drought, doctors began to wonder about the

accidental spread of experimentally concocted microbes to more vulnerable

habitats and about their effects on human health.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#18:1> While others in the medical community dreamed of curing hered <l>

itary deficiencies in humans, social scientists and theologians began to

wonder about the propriety of <quote> " playing God." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#19:1> Although these unsettling questions had been suggested by earlier

genetic research, it wasn't until 1973 that dealing with them became a

critical exercise.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#20:1> The sudden urgency with which they had come to be asked also

confirmed that Boyer and Cohen had, at the very least, given birth not only

to a new form of life but to a major technological revolution. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-023#21:1> Less than two decades later, the revolution known as

biotechnology has taken concrete shape around the world.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#22:1> Researchers at government, uni <l> versity, and private laboratories

are now working at a feverish pace to develop new products for industrial and

household consumption - a pace that is understandably leaving legislators and

regulators far behind.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#23:1> In biotechnology, Canada stands with a handful of countries at the

vanguard of promoting an unprecedented economic and humanitarian opportunity.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#24:1> Like the development of nuclear power - to which biotechnology is so

often compared - however, it is an opportunity in need of careful

public-policy attention.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#25:1> Accordingly, the federal government, chiefly through the National

Biotechnology Advisory Committee of the Department of Indus <l> try, Science

and Technology, has embarked on a process to develop just such a set of

regulations.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#26:1> The nature of those regulations and the govern <l> ment's diligence

in enforcing them will determine in large measure whether Canada succeeds in

harnessing biotechnology's benefits while avoiding its risks.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#27:1> The opportunity is unique, and the issues are complex and varied.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-023#28:1> Biotechnology, broadly speaking, is not new.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#29:1> Its origins date back eight to ten thousand years, when humans first

began selecting plants for food crops.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#30:1> Most of our main staples can be traced back to those early discover

<l> ies.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#31:1> Gradually our ancestors learned to breed new, more palatable and

productive varieties by means of cross-breeding.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#32:1> Animal domestication also has a long heritage, and the vast diversity

we see today in species like the dog is the result of primitive but

intentional breeding.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#33:1> The ubiquity of livestock such as the cow is a reflection of the

success and economic rele <l> vance of that human intervention. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-023#34:1> Though they could not be aware of it then, primitive plant and

animal breeders were brewing new combinations of the basic units of heredity

- genes.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#35:1> By mating different varieties of the same species, and in rare cases

members of different but sexually compatible species, genes became slightly

modified and expressed in subsequent generations.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#36:1> Genetic engi <l> neering, the process pioneered by Boyer and Cohen,

however, represents a radical departure in speed and effectiveness.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#37:1> Its essence lies in the direct manipulation of the hereditary

blueprint found in living cells, the deoxyribonucleic acid molecule, or DNA,

of which genes are constructed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-023#38:1> First identified in the 1940s by Oswald Avery and described

chemically in 1953 by Nobel Prize-winning researchers James Watson and

Francis Crick, DNA has become a synonym for modern biotechnology.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#39:1> Its celebrated double-helix structure is a wondrous example of

chemistry's graceful sym <l> metry.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#40:1> The DNA molecule consists of two long, spiralling strands of sugar

and phosphate which are joined horizontally - as steps join the sides of a

winding staircase - by an alternating sequence of chemical structures.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#41:1> Each horizontal <quote> " step" </quote> consists of a pair of

chemicals called base pairs which jut out from the sugar-phosphate strands

and are joined by weak chemical bonds in the middle.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#42:1> There are four bases - adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine - and

each has an affinity for joining with only one of its potential partners:

thymine with adneine and cytosine with guanine.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#43:1> It is in the sequence of these chemicals up and down the DNA strands

that genetic information is encoded, like the sequence of binary digits that

instructs a computer to perform its calculations.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#44:1> Depending on the order of the chemicals along distinct portions of

the DNA strand, the DNA molecule will instruct the body to synthesize a

variety of distinct chains of amino acids known as polypeptides.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#45:1> A gene is a linear segment of the DNA strand that contains enough

information to direct the cell chemistry to compile a polypeptide.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#46:1> Polypeptides, in turn, are the building blocks of complex molecules

known as proteins. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-023#47:1> Responsible for a wide range of biological functions in plants,

animals, and micro-organisms, proteins come in many different kinds and com

<l> prise much of the dry weight of living organisms.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#48:1> They are composed of 20 different amino acids, differing in character

according to the number and order of amino acids in the protein chain.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#49:1> An average protein is com <l> posed of about 100 amino acids.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#50:1> The order of variously shaped amino acids causes a protein to fold

into a specific shape, and by virtue of that shape the protein possesses

certain properties that determine organic function and structure.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#51:1> Proteins, for example, can link with oxygen molecules in the air and

carry them to required parts of the body, or they can join together and form

visible body features such as hair and muscle.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#52:1> It is proteins, more than anything else, that are the stuff of life.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-023#53:1> Biotechnology, whether through the direct intervention of genetic

engineering or the relative pot luck of conventional breeding, exploits the

relationship between genes and the protein structures they are pro <l>

grammed to build.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#54:1> What permitted Boyer and Cohen to become direct causal agents in the

fusion of genetic information from unrelated species was the discovery in

1970 of a specific set of natural chemical tools known as restriction

endonucleases that make it possible to splice segments of DNA from different

strands.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#55:1> These enzymes generally exist to restrict DNA from a foreign species

from mingling with the genetic material in bacterial cells.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#56:1> Since the rules of DNA construction in theory permit DNA from any two

species - whether bird, insect, fungus, or human - to intertwine, one of the

ways nature ensures the survival of living organisms by maintaining diversity

is by erecting barriers to this intermingling.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#57:1> An example of such a barrier is the restriction endonuclease.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#58:1> When foreign DNA strays into a bacterial cell, these enzymes identify

the strand as foreign and defend the bacterial DNA by shattering it to

pieces.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#59:1> Fortunately for the genetic engi <l> neer, the attack is very

systematic.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#60:1> Each type of restriction endonuclease is trained to splice a DNA

strand at a specific sequence of base pairs to which it has an aversion.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#61:1> In doing so, it leaves the broken pieces of DNA - there can be

millions of them, depending on the length and make-up of the original DNA -

with split ends, like the dangling copper ends of a severed extension cord.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#62:1> These dangling, unmated bases have a tendency to recombine either

with their original base-pair partners or with other dan <l> gling bases that

possess a complementary sequence to their own.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#63:1> But because of the great numbers of broken pieces of DNA created by

the shat <l> tering, it is unlikely they will recombine directly with the

complementary bases of their original DNA mates.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#64:1> So they recombine randomly with neighboring DNA segments, producing a

host of small and disordered DNA strands. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-023#65:1> Genetic engineers use the destructive capacity of restriction

endonu <l> cleases to shatter and combine DNA strands from different species.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#66:1> In lab <l> oratories, DNA strands from two species are mixed with the

restriction endonucleases.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#67:1> Pieces from the two previously distinct DNA strands, having been

shattered at similar base-pair-sequence points, have an equal tendency to

combine with each other as with pieces from their original DNA strands.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#68:1> The random recombination yields a mixture of thousands ( and perhaps

millions) of diverse molecules, many of them consisting of DNA from both

species, known as recombinant DNA.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#69:1> To this mixture, the genetic engineer then adds enzymes known as

ligases to cement the bonds. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-023#70:1> For a piece of recombinant DNA to be useful in industrial

applications, many copies are needed.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#71:1> Since living cells are capable of dividing rapidly - and in so doing

make identical copies of their DNA - genetic engineers use them as DNA

factories.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#72:1> To accomplish this they mix a collection of recombinant DNA into a

pool of bacterial cells.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#73:1> There, parts of cells known as plasmids, pieces of DNA which normally

move benignly in an out of cells, latch on to stray bits of foreign DNA and

shuttle them into cells.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#74:1> In some cases, viruses, which also have a tendency to latch on to

DNA, are used.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#75:1> When a virus succeeds in invading a cell, it may also carry with it

bits of foreign DNA.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#76:1> In either case, out of the vast and disorganized colony of altered

cells in the broth, cells containing the desired DNA segments ( which are far

too small to be detected microscopically) must be identi <l> fied.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#77:1> This can be accomplished using a variety of methods.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#78:1> In one method, the broth is laced with radioactivated RNA molecules

which hone in on the desired DNA strip and mark it.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#79:1> According to another, the protein produced by a selected cell is

isolated and matched against the protein known to be produced by the desired

DNA segment.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#80:1> Once a bacterium possessing the desired DNA segment - or gene - is

located, it can be removed from the broth.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#81:1> These cells can then be cultivated in large quan <l> tities to become

the drugs, the chemicals, and the microbes of modern biotechnology.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-023#82:1> They are what hold the promise and the threat of an industry which,

just two decades ago, was relegated almost exclusively to government and

university laboratories, and which, propelled by private enterprise, has

become a multi-billion-dollar business. </p> </I>
