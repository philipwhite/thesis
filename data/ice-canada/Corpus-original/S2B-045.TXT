<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-045#1:1:A> High levels of either dramatic critical knowledge or overall

domain knowledge differentiate readers from those with little or no relevant

<,> domain knowledge
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#2:1:A> If you know about the relevant culture and if you are an expert in

the particular genre the text relates to then your reading of the text will

be different from those without your double level of expertise
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#3:1:A> On the other hand however cultural and critical expertise together

does not necessarily lead to more numerous explanations than emanate from

readers with high levels of other types of domain knowledge
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#4:1:A> Overall results <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#5:1:A> Taken as a whole
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#6:1:A> I guess it's what's called <mention> conclusion </mention> <unclear>

about three words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#7:1:A> Taken as a whole all of these comparisons indicate that experts read

differently than non-experts do
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#8:1:A> Hypothesis number one
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#9:1:A> They also show that experts read more into a text than do

non-experts
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#10:1:A> Hypothesis number two
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#11:1:A> And that knowledge of the relevant culture differentiates readers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#12:1:A> Hypothesis three
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#13:1:A> Hypothesis four
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#14:1:A> Commonly held ways of reading among experts has not been neatly

proven <,> however
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#15:1:A> <unclear> word </unclear> my study produced the finding that expert

readings must have specific domain knowledge in order to distinguish

themselves as a group from non-experts
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#16:1:A> Belonging to the same group of experts on theory is not enough to

differentiate one group of readers from another
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#17:1:A> So if you take all the semioticians in the room you will not answer

as a <?> whole </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#18:1:A> Sorry folks
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#19:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#20:1:A> Discussion
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#21:1:A> These conclusions are consistent with other studies reported on in

my book and with experiments conducted by <}> <-> <.> co </.> </-> <=>

cognitive </=> </}> scientists on non-literary texts <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#22:1:A> To illustrate the latter point let me cite the example of the work

of <@> Dane Bosch </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#23:1:A> This experimental cognitivist <}> <-> use accounts </-> <=> used

accounts </=> </}> of a fictitious baseball game to study the difference

between what baseball experts learn and retain when reading <,> and what <}>

<-> non-expert baseball </-> <=> <,> non baseball experts </=> </}> learned

and retained from the same text
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#24:1:A> <@> Bosch </@> found that high knowledge subjects reported larger

chunks of information and recalled more propositions than did low knowledge

subjects
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#25:1:A> High knowledge subjects also described textual events in more <}>

<-> <.> graphi </.> </-> <=> graphically </=> </}> and with more variety than

did the low knowledge group
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#26:1:A> The conclusions <@> Bosch </@> drew from his <}> <-> full-scale

study </-> <=> full-scale study </=> </}> about knowledge levels and reading

recall of a non-literary text could very well be applied to what I have found

when studying the reception of a literary text
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#27:1:A> According to both these studies domain-related concepts of the high

knowledge individual are more differentiated than the concepts of the <}> <->

no <.> lo </.> </-> <=> low knowledge </=> </}> individual
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#28:1:A> Furthermore high knowledge individuals have a much greater

knowledge of contingent relations and are more adept at using this knowledge

than are those with low domain knowledge
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#29:1:A> In general then those who read either non-literary or literary

texts reveal similar patterns of reading and understanding
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#30:1:A> There are commonly held concepts and ways of reading within and

between different groups of readers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#31:1:A> There is a difference between the perceptions of nine na&iuml;ve

readers and those of <}> <-> literary readers </-> <=> literary experts </=>

</}>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#32:1:A> Literary critics as do other informed readers read differently than

do non-informed readers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#33:1:A> My empirical research into reader response has provided some useful

insights into the role of interpretive strategies <,> the significance of

critical knowledge domain specific critical expertise and the role of culture

in the reading process
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#34:1:A> It also points to answers some of the questions I first posed in

nineteen eighty-nine in an article that appeared in <@> Linguika </@> called

<@> The Reader as Expert </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#35:1:A> And if you look at the book summary you'll see that I have the last

chapter is called <@> The Reader as Expert Part Two </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#36:1:A> And the book is really a response to <}> <-> that whole </-> <=>

that article </=> </}> that appeared in nineteen eighty-nine
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#37:1:A> Literary critics do have expertise that distinguishes them from

non-critics
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#38:1:A> Literary critics tend to respond consistently as a group and

therefore have expertise that is not idiosyncratic
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#39:1:A> Literary critics pick up the same text markers that other readers

do but they do so more frequently and more consistently than do na&iuml;ve

readers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#40:1:A> But <,> colleagues beware
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#41:1:A> These results should be considered tentative and incomplete
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#42:1:A> My samples were relatively small and there are many interesting

calculations and cross-calculations which could only have been <}> <-> <.>

deter </.> </-> <=> determined </=> </}> from a very <}> <-> large </-> <=>

large </=> </}> scale study
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#43:1:A> Studies of the kind I conducted might very well need to be

completely redesigned should new critical models and different testing

methods emerge
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#44:1:A> With time and further research we will also learn to pose other

questions
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#45:1:A> To what degree for example do informed readers propose answers

which are probably accurate or likely to be believed as opposed to those

spontaneously arrived at
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#46:1:A> Do critics behave more often as problem solvers than as expert

readers <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#47:1:A> Does a change of context in a text make a difference to the use of

reading strategies
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#48:1:A> So many questions
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#49:1:A> So few answers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#50:1:A> In the context of reader response to literature and the performance

of critics as experts <,> the eye of the beholder holds and contemplates many

mysteries yet to be solved
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#51:1:A> Thanks <&> applause </&> </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-045#52:2:A> The geography of women is really just a first step <,> though

a necessary one because the real problem <?> about <?> incorporating women

into geography <?> lies <?> not with <unclear> word </unclear> empirical

research but <?> at the </?> theoretical and analytical level <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#53:2:A> The copious quantities of new descriptive and empirical material on

women had been collected using traditional geographic <unclear> word

</unclear> assumptions methodologies and paradigms
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#54:2:A> In the early nineteen eighties it became apparent that in order to

analyze this new content women a new analytical framework feminism was needed

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#55:2:A> Feminist geography is therefore faced with the much larger task of

reworking and redefining geographic theory <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#56:2:A> So what is feminist geography <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#57:2:A> Just as there isn't one definition of <mention> feminism </mention>

or <?> even </?> <mention> geography </mention> there is also no one

definition of the intersection of these two things <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#58:2:A> <?> I define </?> feminist geography as a study which explores

dynamic interrelations between space and gender <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#59:2:A> On the one hand the social construction of gender effects the <?>

ways <?> and extents to which women and men <?> influence <?> and create <,>

their <?> lives </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#60:2:A> On the other hand <,> space structures and <?> creates </?>

existing <unclear> word </unclear> forms of gender relations <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#61:2:A> As <@> Julianne Rowes </@> and <@> Lars Allen </@> point out

geographers <?> have long </?> <unclear> word </unclear> that landscapes are

cultural constructs <,> but they've never considered the ways in which gender

is involved in this process <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#62:2:A> The geography of women is a necessary precursor for the entrance of

feminist geography into human geography but it wasn't a sufficient one
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#63:2:A> Feminist geography also emerged at a certain point in the history

of geography when similar developments were taking place <,> </I>

<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#67:3:A> At least
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#68:3:A> Maybe the English Department hasn't found out yet though
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#69:3:A> I'm expecting the cheque so
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#70:3:A> Uhm <,,> there's an irony to that as well to this idea that uh the

paper for all that it has this kind of esoteric uh topic matter or title uhm

is actually dealing with a form and a subgenre that is very popular
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#71:3:A> Uhm the novel I'll be speaking of principally today Neuromancer by

William Gibson at last look had gone through about fifteen editions has

spawned an entire subgenre of material
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#72:3:A> There are cyberpunk films that are watched by <,> the populous at

large
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#73:3:A> I guess Robocop might be one of the best known ones <}> <-> or </->

<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#74:3:A> Uh there's <?> musical </?> attached to it
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#75:3:A> There's almost a lifestyle that's become attached to it
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#76:3:A> Uhm and so we're talking about something <}> <-> that </-> <=> that

</=> </}> is extremely populist uh <}> <-> <.> a </.> </-> <=> and </=> </}>

not particularly esoteric
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#77:3:A> At least perhaps not as esoteric as Roman latrines <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#78:3:A> So from beginning from that irony let me begin
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#79:3:A> We are approaching the asyntotic limit of gender <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#80:3:A> Not the collapse of sexual difference but the ever-receding point

at which differences verge on but <}> <-> new </-> <=> do </=> </}> not

become self-identical <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#81:3:A> In the information age the body and the irregular formations of

gender which accrete about it are effaced become bits of data with no greater

epistemological charge than any other bit of data circulating through our

modems and microprocessors
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#82:3:A> Homo datum retains only the irreducible trace <,> of gender
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#83:3:A> People hooked into the network of databases electronic uhm bulletin

boards and mailboxes exist as identities free of reference to their bodies
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#84:3:A> Computer hackers indulge in the opportunity to leave behind the

meat of their physical form and sing the body electric
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#85:3:A> In the Net no one can tell if you're black or white male or female

young or old oppositions which have a declining relevance once freed of the

imperium of the gaze <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#86:3:A> Well the technology of gene splicing and virtual reality software

tend towards its eclipse much recent feminist critical theory has been

concerned with the role of gender in the construction of gender and identity
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#87:3:A> Teresa de Laurentis for example reconfigures Foucault's analysis of

<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#88:3:A> Donna Haraway's well-known essay A Manifesto for Cyborgs however

<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#90:3:A> Haraway embraces the figure of the cyborg <,> the assemblage of the

consciousness and machine agency which blurs the notion of a unitary

autonomous and self-aware subject
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#91:3:A> The cyborg for Haraway is quote <quote> illegitimate </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#92:3:A> It quote <quote> skips the step of original unity of identification

<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#93:3:A> Cyborgs of course are not simply the products of a technosocial or

<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#96:3:A> Frankenstien is also considered by many to be the first true

science fiction story and it is not surprisingly science fiction that has

<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#97:3:A> Cyberpunk the most recent aesthetic revolution in science fiction

<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#98:3:A> The term <mention> cyberpunk </mention> signifies less a set of <,>

so much as it does a range of literary styles and themes which only

<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#99:3:A> Its arrival as a full grown movement <,> was announced by the

<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#100:3:A> In this preface Sterling notes two recurrent sources of

fascination in cyberpunk
<ICE-CAN:S2B-045#101:3:A> And this will give you some sense of the kind of topic matter that
