<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-025#1:1:A> As the Prime Minister has pointed out he will be open <,> to

suggestions
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#2:1:A> He will be open to changes <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#3:1:A> The proposals put forward by the government are just that proposals

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#4:1:A> And the job of the joint parliamentary committee <,> will not be

that of simply selling those proposals or indeed selling the point of view of

any one political party <,> but to take these proposals to Canadians <,> and

to listen to Canadians
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#5:1:A> Today the Government of Canada <,> has put forth its proposals and

we have heard those proposals and now we must go forward to hear the people

of Canada <&> applause, 7 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-025#6:1:A> In the coming months there will be much to say <,> and I'm sure

there are things that Canadians can agree with in this document <,> but we

must also raise questions and issues <,> as well
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#7:1:A> I and my party are committed to an open process
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#8:1:A> We have agreed to serve on the parliamentary committee because we

believe that there we can help to open up that process <,> a process through

which Canadians can truly be heard and not just heard but listened to <,,>

and a process through which Canadians can accept or modify or reject or

change or add on to <,> what the government has put forward today
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#9:1:A> The final outcome must and will reflect the views of all Canadians

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#10:1:A> The constitution cannot be left simply in the hands of politicians

but must be the work of the hands and the minds and the heart <,> of the

people of Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#11:1:A> Let me also say at the outset that we recognize that <}> <-> the

are </-> <=> these are </=> </}> tough times for Canadians
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#12:1:A> Canadian families have many preoccupations the high unemployment

rate the difficulty in a vastly changing world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#13:1:A> And it's not easy to think about constitutions and nation building

when Canadians are worried about jobs and taxes about trying to make ends

meet and so this debate has to be made relevant to Canadians and it has to be

meaningful in the day to day lives <,> of Canadians <&> applause, 10 seconds

</&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-025#14:1:A> Having said this let us be very clear that the stakes <,> are

high <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#15:1:A> We are talking about whether or not Canada will continue to exist

as we know it <,> albeit with change
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#16:1:A> We are talking about holding onto and strengthening a nation that

is much admired around the globe <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#17:1:A> There is no one who has <,> voted for myself certainly or anyone in

this party who has given us permission <,> to work to tear this country apart

but they have said to us we must work to keep this country together to renew

the federation
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#18:1:A> That is the responsibility I take as the leader of the New

Democratic Party
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#19:1:A> That is the responsibility that my party assumes and will

participate in <&> applause and crowd reaction, 10 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-025#20:1:A> But there are some people Mister Speaker in all parts of

Canada <,> who say that it's too late for Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#21:1:A> And to them let me cite the words of a first generation immigrant

<,> who said and I repeat <,> <quote> I came here as a guest </quote> <@>

Rahim Balangee </@> writes <quote> and Canada was generous as it has been to

the generations of guests it has accepted and accommodated in its short and

glorious history </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#22:1:A> <O> quote continues </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#23:1:A> Well Mister Speaker I can only agree with that person who chose

this country for many of the values that all of us hold dear because it would

be a tragedy Mister Speaker because we are a nation like no other populated

by the First Nations a vibrant French-speaking society rich regional cultures

people who have come from every corner of this globe who make up the reality

of Canada in nineteen ninety-one <,> and who work together as we move to the

twenty-first century
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#24:1:A> We are a northern nation Mister Speaker of great possibilities

where citizens and cultures come together
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#25:1:A> I'm here because I believe in this northern nation
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#26:1:A> I believe in this possibility
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#27:1:A> I believe that though we are far from perfect we offer the world an

example of tolerance and harmony <,> and yes we can give to the world some

hope <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#28:1:A> We have a responsibility Mister Speaker to others <,> to ourselves

to those who follow to fulfill the promise of Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#29:1:A> I'm here because I believe we can join together to correct the

flaws address the injustices and create the best Canada we can <,> a Canada

that all Canadians will want to belong to
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#30:1:A> Let me turn then to the proposals put forward today
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#31:1:A> <O> French, 2 minutes 30 seconds </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#32:1:A> <&> part of comment missing from audio </&> are delighted to say

<?> the least <?> Mister Speaker to see the government is looking at the

abolition of the present non-elected Senate <,> <?> the </?> goal we have

held for many many years in this party
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#33:1:A> One also sees in this document Mister Speaker movement <,> towards

something else my party has long advocated and that is the recognition of the

right of aboriginal people to self-government
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#34:1:A> In this document the government does not address the inherent right

to self-government and I would suggest that that must be a major part of the

discussion as the committee goes forward <&> applause, 5 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-025#35:1:A> And let me say <,> in this area Mister Speaker that a

fundamental principle must be that aboriginal people must be involved in

every way at every stage at every step along the way
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#36:1:A> The First Nations of Canada must have a prominent place at the

constitutional table
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#37:1:A> Let me say with respect to the division of powers Mister Speaker

that it will take some time to fully study the government's proposals
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#38:1:A> We are talking about some fundamental changes
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#39:1:A> The New Democratic Party is not opposed to change <,> but we feel

in each area there must be a rationale for how that change <,> will meet the

needs of Canadian people <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#40:1:A> In areas such as immigration and <}> <-> <.> cult </.> </-> <=>

culture </=> </}> for instance <,> I think Canadians must be able to see how

these changes <,> would in fact directly benefit them <,,> because all of

these changes will have a profound impact on the future of our nation as a

whole and how Canada will come to be defined in the twenty-first century
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#41:1:A> I must <}> <-> restrate </-> <=> restate </=> </}> that the New

Democratic Party believes that a strong Canada requires a strong <,> national

government
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#42:1:A> Any redistribution of powers that takes place must meet one

fundamental test for this party
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#43:1:A> It must not be about meeting the demands of government
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#44:1:A> It must be judged on the criteria of meeting the needs of citizens

<&> applause, 10 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-025#45:1:A> Mister Speaker it's my view that the role of the federal

government must be re-examined
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#46:1:A> The government has put out some proposals on this
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#47:1:A> But let us remember if we <}> <-> to </-> <=> are to </=> </}>

accept the principle as I certainly do as my party certainly does that the

diversity of Canada is part of our strength that the rights of First Nations

the distinctiveness of Quebec <,> the rich culture and contribution of our

multiculture multi-ethnic communities the equality of men and women all of

which are fundamental to who we are as a nation if we are to recognize that

diversity in a fundamental way we must also recognize in a fundamental way

that the unity of this country will require a federal government that can

represent every Canadian in all parts of the country in the national interest

and the international interest
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#48:1:A> <&> applause starts </&> That's what the New Democratic Party

<unclear> word </unclear> <,,> <&> applause stops </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#49:1:A> I repeat Mister Speaker that there are a number of things <,> that

we can look favourably upon in initial reading of these proposals but there

are also elements <,> that are potentially disturbing elements that indicate

that this government has a very different vision of the future of Canada <,>

a very different vision and of course it is <,> the Conservative Party vision

of Canada <,> but it is a vision certainly in some instances that is

certainly not shared by the New <}> <-> <.> nem </.> </-> <=> Democratic </=>

</}> Party nor by many Canadians
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#50:1:A> It is of course the government's right to put forward its vision in

terms of its own political philosophy <,> but if the consultation process if

the parliamentary committee is to have any meaning <,,> we must seriously

look at all visions of Canada <,> and try to come up with a consensus on what

will best represent all Canadians and not one agenda <&> applause, 5 seconds

</&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-025#51:1:A> I want to raise some questions particularly Mister Speaker on

the proposed economic union
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#52:1:A> I believe we can all agree in this House that the reduction of

trade barriers <?> at </?> greater cooperation among provinces and

territories is an important and a laudable goals <,> but we must ask <,> some

hard questions
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#53:1:A> Does the kind of domestic free trade in people goods finance and

capital extend the same <indig> laissez faire </indig> principles of the

Canada U S trade deal to a domestic playing field <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#54:1:A> Will there be winners and losers in this and if so how do we deal

with that
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#55:1:A> Could this potentially lead to a whole new round of privatization

deregulation <,> diminishing social standards and diminishing corporate taxes

<,,> as we look at this in terms of greater cooperation
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#56:1:A> And Mister Speaker we must raise questions about the ability within

Canada <,> to reach the goals that we wish <}> <-> to </-> <=> to </=> </}>

reach in this economic cooperation if we in fact do not have a transportation

infrastructure in place <,> which is absolutely necessary in a country of

this <&> applause starts </&> size and which has lamentably has been

systematically destroyed <,,> <&> applause stops </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#57:1:A> What does the right of corporations to free movement of goods

services and capital mean for weaker provinces who seek to establish their

own <,> economic development programs
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#58:1:A> What does it mean for provincial Crown corporations
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#59:1:A> What does it mean for provinces or territories trying to support

local jobs in fledgling industries
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#60:1:A> What does it mean for affirmative action
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#61:1:A> What are the implications <,> of this form of <,> economic union

<,> in terms of aboriginal self-government agreements
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#62:1:A> Economic union that only addresses control and <}> <-> <.> harmon

</.> </-> <=> harmonization </=> </}> but does not mention initiatives to

have greater regional equality and to strengthening section thirty-six of the

constitution on regional equality falls far short <,> in this party's opinion

<&> applause, 5 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-025#63:1:A> Economic union proposals that suggest that the only role of

the Bank of Canada will be to address inflation but not as well to look at

unemployment to look at fiscal and monetary policy as an instrument to

address unemployment falls far short <,> Mister Speaker of what we can be and

can do if we're to have greater cooperation in the economy across this

country
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#64:1:A> And so I say Mister Speaker that <,> while we support greater

cooperation while we support looking at a renewal of the relationships

between the provinces territories and the federal government in economic

areas we must also not simply take a defensive posture but a posture that

says in this economy we will reach out we will initiate to seek greater

equality and that that will be a strong commitment of a federal government

any federal government of any political party and a fundamental part of our

constitution <&> applause, 10 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-025#65:1:A> Mister Speaker part of the proposals on the economic union

include a Council of the Federation <,> and there're again many issues I

think that must be discussed in terms of what that council will do <,> what

kind of decision-making powers that council will have how those will mesh

with the decisions of the House of Commons and indeed what implications a

Council of Federations has which according to the document instrument make

many decisions when in fact aboriginal groups will not be included on that

and yet we'll have according to the same document aboriginal self-government

agreements
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#66:1:A> So there are questions to be raised Mister Speaker
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#67:1:A> We will be doing so in a constructive manner with alternatives <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-025#68:1:A> And I find that <,,> what is important as we move into this process

at this time is that we are constructive and we do present ah proposals <,>

and when we raise our vision of Canada and our alternatives it's not simply

to discredit someone else it's because we truly believe that each of us in

this House each political party has a contribution which will be

fundamentally in the interests of Canada and that if all of those

contributions can be brought together we will have the kind of consensus on a

constitution that we must have because as we know the constitution is not

simply the government's constitution the New Democratic Party's constitution

the Liberal Party's constitution it is a constitution for the people of

Canada now and in the future <&> applause, 10 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-025#69:1:A> Mister Speaker I also find it somewhat disturbing that the

proposals <}> <-> put </-> <=> put </=> </}> forward today include such

things as the entrenchment of property rights but make no mention of the need

to entrench social rights <&> applause, 5 seconds </&> </I>
