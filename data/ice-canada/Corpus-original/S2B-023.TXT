<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-023#1:1:A> Together it is these reforms that produce the strongest

framework of economic union since confederation
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#2:1:A> Mister Speaker <,,> we propose as well a Canada clause <,> which

would be entrenched in the body of the constitution in Section Two of the

Constitution Act <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#3:1:A> I hope and believe that <,> all of our people will see reflected in

that clause <,> their own place in Canada <,> the common values and

aspirations that unite us <,> and our national characteristics <,> and our

identity <,> as we wish it to be
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#4:1:A> We are a nation with an immense capacity for generosity and

compromise <,> a capacity <,> that has never mattered more than it matters

today <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#5:1:A> Parochialism <,> small-mindedness <,> mistrust <,> these are always

present in any society <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#6:1:A> These lesser attributes have had their day <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#7:1:A> It's now time for the fundamental qualities of generosity and

compromise <,> to dominate the process <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#8:1:A> There are in all <,> twenty-eight proposals that the Government of

Canada is putting forward today for consideration by the joint committee and

discussion with the people of Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#9:1:A> <O> French, 45 seconds </O> <&> applause, 7 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-023#10:1:A> Mister Speaker <,> these proposals <,> which are perfectible

which are going to a committee which will begin hearing tomorrow <,> will

hopefully be examined in an objective and fair-minded manner not by people

<}> <-> <.> sear </.> </-> <=> searching </=> </}> for perfection because

perfection can become the enemy of the good <,> but for proposals that are

good for Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#11:1:A> No one need lose <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#12:1:A> <}> <-> This isn't </-> <=> <}> <-> If if </-> <=> If </=> </}> the

cause </=> </}> and the hopes and aspirations of Western Canada are advanced

<,> that does not mean that that <}> <-> <.> advan </.> </-> <=> advancement

</=> </}> means a lose for Quebec
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#13:1:A> And if French Canadians feel no more secure <,> as a result of

constitutional proposals <,,> and feel a greater attachment and a greater

love for Canada that doesn't mean that the <,> rights of <,,> Canadians <}>

<-> in English Canada </-> <=> in English-speaking Canada </=> </}> say in

the Atlantic regions need in any way be diminished
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#14:1:A> This can
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#15:1:A> Constitutional proposals fairly considered <,> actively debated

<,,> generously contemplated <,> can be what they should be <,,> a win-win

situation for all Canadians <&> Applause, 10 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-023#16:1:A> And how are they to be considered <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#17:1:A> Well each one of us <,> across the country each Premier or each <,>

taxpayer or each parliamentarian <,,> each of us <,> will have to establish I

suppose his or her own <,> sense of parameters and his or <?> her own </?>

<&> sounds like " hone" </&> objective criteria
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#18:1:A> But I think that these proposals must also be considered <,> in

light of our greatest obligation
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#19:1:A> We've got many obligations
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#20:1:A> You can enumerate them
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#21:1:A> You can count <}> <-> em </-> <+> them </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#22:1:A> You can divide <}> <-> em </-> <+> them </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#23:1:A> You can add <}> <-> em </-> <+> them </+> </}> up
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#24:1:A> But our greatest obligation as Canadians and as parliamentarians

sitting here today is to turn Canada over to our children and our

grandchildren <,> unsullied and undiminished as a great prosperous united

nation
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#25:1:A> <{> <[> That is our fundamental obligation <,,> </[> <[> <&>

applause, 15 seconds </&> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-023#26:1:A> And to do that will require compromise
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#27:1:A> And compromise is not an indication of weakness
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#28:1:A> Honourable compromise in Canada has always been seen <,> as an

indication of strength and maturity
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#29:1:A> The wisdom of <,> knowing <,> uh that all of us have to find our

own places in the Canadian sunlight <,> makes me hopeful Mister Speaker that

this proposal these series of proposals once engaged will give us all the

opportunity to participate in the building of Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#30:1:A> Thomas D'Arcy McGee who was a son of Ireland <,> but who became a

father of Canada <,> saw a brilliant future for our country
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#31:1:A> Seven years before confederation <,,> he said <quote> I look to the

future of my adoptive country with hope though not without anxiety </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#32:1:A> <O> quote continues </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#33:1:A> Mister Speaker <,> I along with all other members of this House and

all political parties <,> I too see such a country <,> a country of women and

men of your children and mine whose standard of living is the envy of

millions and whose way of life <,> is admired around the world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#34:1:A> This country <,> Canada <,> the second largest country on Earth is

also according to the United Nations one of the two best countries in the

world in which to live and the challenge for us now is to make Canada second

to none <&> applause, 10 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-023#35:1:A> The challenge is to build a stronger country for the security

and the prosperity of all Canadians
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#36:1:A> Mister Speaker I have said in this House and other occasions that

the job of nation building did not end <,> with confederation
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#37:1:A> And <}> <-> had they sought </-> <=> had the father of

confederation sought </=> </}> perfection and insisted on perfection there'd

have been no Canada <,> in eighteen sixty-seven
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#38:1:A> And that was the beginning of nation building but it continues with

each generation and it continues to this day in our minds and in our hearts
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#39:1:A> And we want as McGee said a constitution <,> cherished <,> in the

hearts of all of its people
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#40:1:A> Not part of its people not some of its people not the people who

live in the west <,> and the east but English-speaking <,> Canadians

French-speaking Canadians from the north the south the east <,> all Canadians

are deserving of a constitution that <}> <-> <.> re </.> </-> <=> represents

</=> </}> them and reflects their hopes and dreams and aspirations for a new

and a better Canada <&> applause, 10 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-023#41:1:A> So we have the challenge to keep Canada and today we have the

opportunity to improve it
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#42:1:A> Mister Speaker nothing would serve the economic interests of all

Canadians more directly than clear resolution of constitutional challenges
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#43:1:A> They've bedevilled this nation for too long
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#44:1:A> And I think it would be with a sense of national relief and

gratitude that all Canadians <,> dealt with a proposal and managed to bring

this to a successful conclusion
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#45:1:A> In that spirit <,> I invite all Canadians <,> all political parties

who believe in one undiminished Canada <,> to set aside other differences and

to engage in nation building with the full exuberance that this magnificent

country deserves
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#46:1:A> I suggest Mister Speaker we get on with it <,> the building of

Canada of the vision of McDonald and Cartier and McGee and the country of our

own dreams a new Canada <,> for a new century <,> honoured in the family of

nations as a modern and flexible and caring country <,> a Canada respected by

its peers a Canada loved by its people a Canada better able to serve its

citizens with governments and institutions revised and reformed by this

parliament and by all Canadians that will be tied to the very best that

Canada can provide <&> applause, 1 minute 15 seconds </&>

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-023#47:1:Z> <O> introduction </O> <&> applause, 25 seconds </&>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-023#48:1:B> Mister Speaker I rise in this House today <,> very conscious

of the importance of the issue <,> before us <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#49:1:B> At a time of significant national debate <,> each of us must

fulfill our duty to the best of our ability
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#50:1:B> At a time when there is cynicism about the role of politicians it

is particularly important that the political process work <,> the way it

should
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#51:1:B> I want to be very clear Mister Speaker that the role of opposition

is not to give a blank cheque to the government <,> nor it is our role to

oppose simply <,> for the sake of opposing something
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#52:1:B> The role of the opposition is to scrutinize <,> to ask the right

questions <,> to propose improvements <,> and to seek to correct error <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#53:1:B> The role of the opposition is to speak for those who have no voice
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#54:1:B> This is a role that we will fulfill in the months ahead
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#55:1:B> I want to say <,,> that our objective is the unity of the country

<}> <-> but <&> applause </&> </-> <=> <,,> but </=> </}> this does not mean

that we will necessarily agree with all of the proposals of the government
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#56:1:B> Indeed <,> our first impression is that the proposals of the

government need a great deal of work
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#57:1:B> Over the next few months some of the debate will be about issues of

principle <,> and we will fight for our principle by proposing improvements

but much of the debate will be about legal <?> text </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#58:1:B> What does one word mean
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#59:1:B> What does one phrase mean
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#60:1:B> Are these flaws that can be corrected <,> or improvements that can

be made
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#61:1:B> <O> French, 1 minute 5 seconds </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#62:1:B> <&> part of audio cut out </&> individual governments and the

courts must rely upon <,> it must accurately reflect the intention of its

authors
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#63:1:B> Let us resolve not to transform a debate on legal meaning <,> of

proposals into an emotional debate about rejections and humiliation <,> and

let us not transform a debate about values into a lot of empty rhetoric and

political posturing
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#64:1:B> Clearly it is too early for anyone to state definitively a hard and

fast position on the government papers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#65:1:B> Constitutional language is extremely important
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#66:1:B> And some of the government paper lacks legal precision
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#67:1:B> In many places <,> we do not have a specific proposal <,,> just a

list of options <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#68:1:B> Over the coming weeks and months <,> with the help of the people of

Canada <,> we in this party will work to find <,> the <&> tape cutes out </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#69:1:B> In this round we will not tolerate constitutional wording which is

so deliberately ambiguous that it can be used to mean one thing in one part

of Canada and something else in other part of country <&> applause, 10

seconds </&>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-023#70:1:B> Ensuring that these proposals are thoroughly debated <,>

thoroughly reviewed <,> and where necessary amended <,> abandoned or enlarged

that is our duty
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#71:1:B> It is a duty we in this party will honour
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#72:1:B> We will not compromise on principles <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#73:1:B> <O> French, 20 seconds </O> <&> applause, 5 seconds </&>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-023#74:1:B> <O> French, 3 minutes 5 seconds </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#75:1:B> <&> part of audio cut out </&> <?> are </?> written for all to see

Mister Speaker
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#76:1:B> The people should never be ignored
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#77:1:B> I will hold the Prime Minister to his promise made today before the

entire nation his promise to involve the people of Canada in this new round

<&> applause, 10 seconds </&>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-023#78:1:B> This joint parliamentary committee is to report at the end of

February <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#79:1:B> We must use the remaining time to study the proposals <,> to debate

their meaning to consult widely and to listen to the people of Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#80:1:B> Mister Speaker <,,> I have spent time talking about the process <,>

because the process is very important <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#81:1:B> Now I will address principle which <,> are equally important <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#82:1:B> One of Canada's greatest constitutional thinkers the late Professor

<,> Scott F R Scott once wrote that <,> <quote> If Canadians can agree upon

great and lasting principles upon which they wish their society to be built

<,> then they can agree upon the broad outlines of a constitution <,> to

achieve these ends </quote> end of quote <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#83:1:B> Our principle as Liberal are clear
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#84:1:B> One what is proposed must be compatible with the very nature of

Canada <,> a nation which finds its <indig> raison d'&ecircumflex;tre

</indig> in sharing <,> diversity <,> and respect for <}> <-> <.> r </.> </->

<=> the right </=> </}> of individual
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#85:1:B> Two <&> applause, 5 seconds </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#86:1:B> Two the solutions proposed must result in real reform of our

political institutions to ensure that the distinct <,> concern of Canada's

regions are respected <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#87:1:B> Three the solution proposed must recognize the need <,> to renew

and modernize our economic instrument including <,> the training and mobility

of our workforce <,> to create policies that will permit us <,> to be

competitive <,> in the world of tomorrow <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#88:1:B> Fourth constitutional reform must not weaken <,> must not weaken

the right of individual as guaranteed in the Charter of Right and Freedom <&>

applause, 7 seconds </&>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-023#89:1:B> Fifth <,> constitutional reform must not weaken <,> Canadian

duality and official language minorities everywhere in Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#90:1:B> <?> Six </?> <,> constitutional reform must not weaken Canada's

cultural diversity and <,> its heritage of tolerance <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#91:1:B> And finally number seven constitutional reform must not weaken the

ability of a strong federal government to speak and act for all Canadians <&>

applause, 15 seconds </&>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-023#92:1:B> Mister Speaker <,> the Liberal Party of Canada entered this

party convinced <,> that the things we call <,> Canadian values are as

relevant today as they have been <,> at any time in our history <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#93:1:B> At a time when Canadian values are under attack <,> and <,> when

our country is divided as never before <,> we believe that Canadians must

remind themselves of the greatness of the Canadian experiment <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#94:1:B> We also believe that Canadians must devote their energies to

finding new bonds and new endeavours which reflect our collective values
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#95:1:B> We must concentrate now on what unite us and not what divide us <&>

applause, 7 seconds </&>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-023#96:1:B> More than ever <,> we must commit ourself to true Canadian

values <,,> values like generosity of spirit and collective action
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#97:1:B> Values that will permit us to meet the next century <,> with our

head held high
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#98:1:B> In discussing constitutional reform we must reflect on the great

and lasting principles of our society <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#99:1:B> Constitutional reforms must have one goal Mister Speaker <,> and

only one goal
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#100:1:B> That is the well-being not of governments <,> not of politicians

<,> not of bureaucrats but the citizens of Canada <&> applause, 7 seconds

</&>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-023#101:1:B> Which government holds which powers <,> only matters in as

much as citizens are well-served
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#102:1:B> Therefore to serve the citizens of Canada and that is what all of

us have been elected to do to serve them we must understand the values we

share as Canadians
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#103:1:B> After all Canadian citizenship means more than a shared passport

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#104:1:B> It is shared values
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#105:1:B> And quite frankly Canadian citizens have a right to a government

that can speak and act for all Canadians
<ICE-CAN:S2B-023#106:1:B> As Canadians <,> we have a unique and profound commitment <,> to a

shared sense of social responsibility </I>
