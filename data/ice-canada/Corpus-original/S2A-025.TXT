you become a teacher

<ICE-CAN:S2A-025#282:2:A> They know they've had that before <,,> okay <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-025#283:2:A> So I do vocabulary because it's something that they know <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-025#284:2:A> And you want to start with something they know <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-025#285:2:A> You want to gain <,> their <,> trust <,,> okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-025#286:2:A> Cos when you have the trust of your students <,> then <,> you can

have a great time <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-025#287:2:A> Then you can start doing very interesting activities
<ICE-CAN:S2A-025#288:2:A> You can start <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-025#289:2:A> But if they don't trust you <,,> they're not <}> <-> gonna </->

<+> going to </+> </}> do that much for you <,,> you know as a teacher
<ICE-CAN:S2A-025#290:2:A> Cos <,> they <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> know if

you're a good teacher <,> or are you a bad teacher <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-025#291:2:A> Because they have to deal <?> with </?> you <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-025#292:2:A> You know they know good teachers they know bad teachers
<ICE-CAN:S2A-025#293:2:A> They know with this teacher they can do whatever they want
<ICE-CAN:S2A-025#294:2:A> They know with that teacher they can't
<ICE-CAN:S2A-025#295:2:A> They <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> know what they're
