<ICE-CAN:S2B-014#2:1:A> <@> Simon Vaselenak </@> is an economics professor at the <indig>

Universit&eacute; de Montr&eacute;al </indig>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-014#3:1:A> He is scheduled to be a keynote speaker at the C L S C's <&> centre

local de services communautaires </&> annual convention later this week
<ICE-CAN:S2B-014#4:1:A> He doesn't approve of the government's health cuts <,> but at the

same time he sees a positive side

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-014#5:1:B> One thing that may result from the cuts is <}> <-> the need

</-> <=> the perceived need </=> </}> to do more with less
<ICE-CAN:S2B-014#6:1:B> And one way to do more with less is to prevent rather than to merely

cure
<ICE-CAN:S2B-014#7:1:B> So this is a silver lining so to speak

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-014#8:1:A> <@> Vaselenak </@> says <quote> preventing illness before it

happens should be a priority in health care </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-014#9:1:A> He says <quote> it will save a lot of money over the long run

</quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-014#10:1:A> But at the same time <@> Vaselenak </@> is worried about people who

are already ill
<ICE-CAN:S2B-014#11:1:A> He says they may have to wait longer now for medical services <,>

and that may mean they'll be sicker before they receive treatment

Barnab&eacute;'s rib cage broke at least two ribs in two places

his support for neighbourhood policing in the Montreal urban community
<ICE-CAN:S2B-014#134:3:A> <@> Sharon McAdam </@> is at the launch
<ICE-CAN:S2B-014#135:3:A> <@> Sharon </@> what did the minister say

that's where police should be stationed
<ICE-CAN:S2B-014#137:3:C> Menard says the government will support community organizations

that teach crime prevention to young people
<ICE-CAN:S2B-014#138:3:C> Interestingly enough he said young people aren't the perpetrators

of violent crime
<ICE-CAN:S2B-014#139:3:C> He said they're three times more the victims of uh violent crime

than older people
<ICE-CAN:S2B-014#140:3:C> He said he wants to keep strong ties with Montreal black community

groups who work on improving relations with police
<ICE-CAN:S2B-014#141:3:C> Uhm I spoke with Vera Daniluk a member of the M U C executive
