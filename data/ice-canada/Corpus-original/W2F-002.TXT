<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#1:1> <h> IRMA AND FLOYD </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#2:1> <bold> <it> by Jill Robertson </it> </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#3:1> Floyd hadn't worked steady for a couple of years, so it was a big

deal when he got on at the mill.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#4:1> It looked like he was going to get on steady, too.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#5:1> The foreman seemed to like him.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#6:1> Borrowed smokes off him all the time, anyway.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#7:1> So when he got his first paycheque, he said to Irma, Let's go into

town and blow this moola on whatever the hell we feel like eating, okay?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#8:1> We've been eating such crummy stuff for so long, let's go crazy.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#9:1> Let's go nuts in the Safeway.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#10:1> He had just got out of the shower, and stood in the steamy bathroom

doorway while he rubbed his hair with a towel as he spoke.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#11:1> She didn't look at his head.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#12:1> He hated her looking at his head when he didn't have his cap on.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#13:1> No one else ever saw him without it.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#14:1> And no one ever better say a word about his hairline receding or

heaven help them.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#15:1> For a while there he even took to wearing his cap in bed, until she

said that that was going too far, just too, too far.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#16:1> He had another towel slung loosely on his hips.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#17:1> She focused on his middle.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#18:1> She liked his flat belly.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#19:1> Not too much hair.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#20:1> He smelled good, too.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#21:1> Smell <l> ed like limes.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#22:1> Okay? he said, heading for the bedroom.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#23:1> Okay Irmy squirmy? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#24:1> Irma, she said, getting herself another coffee.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#25:1> She leafed through the Tupperware catalogue.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#26:1> She stopped and thought about the popsicle maker.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#27:1> Summer was coming on.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#28:1> She thought about the jelly salad moulds, too.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#29:1> Then she pushed out against her stomach until the button on her jeans

snapped.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#30:1> There, she said to herself.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#31:1> That's better. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#32:1> After a couple of minutes he came out again in new jeans.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#33:1> He was snapping up a new Levis shirt.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#34:1> What's that? he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#35:1> Irma, she said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#36:1> I'm Irma. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#37:1> Okay, he said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#38:1> You're Irma.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#39:1> What about the shop <l> ping?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#40:1> Let's get <}> <-> atter </-> <+> at her </+> </}> .
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#41:1> He put on his cat hat.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#42:1> Come on.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#43:1> Let's go. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#44:1> Hm, Irma said, turning a hoop earring around in her ear.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#45:1> How about let's go out for dinner every night this week instead.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#46:1> Let's go to the Red Carpet for steaks every frigging night.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#47:1> Want to? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#48:1> How about let's barbecue, he said, trading the Elephant Brand

fertilizer cap for one that said Slickline.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#49:1> Let's barbeque us a big <}> <-> ole </-> <+> old </+> </}> salmon or

a couple of big thick steaks, or both?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#50:1> Let's do that. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#51:1> Whatever you say, Floyd, she said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#52:1> Whatever you want.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#53:1> It's your money. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#54:1> We each get a shopping cart, he said at the Safeway.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#55:1> Here's yours.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#56:1> Check for good wheels.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#57:1> No excuses for not filling it up.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#58:1> Then we'll meet at the front in half an hour.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#59:1> Got it?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#60:1> Ready?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#61:1> Get whatever you want.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#62:1> But don't buy nothing we're good and sick of, right?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#63:1> No bologna.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#64:1> No Kraft Dinner.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#65:1> Ready?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#66:1> Go!
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#67:1> He actually ran all awkward in his cowboy boots, down the aisle, head

<l> ed for the steaks.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#68:1> She started in produce.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#69:1> He'd want potatoes for his steaks, and green onions.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#70:1> Sour cream, too.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#71:1> Next she hit steak sauce and ketchup. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#72:1> His cart was full of meat when they met at the top of the baking

aisle.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#73:1> T-Bone steaks.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#74:1> Sirloin steaks.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#75:1> Round steaks.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#76:1> Roasts. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#77:1> What are you doing?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#78:1> Trying to corner the beef market?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#79:1> Why don't you just buy a whole cow? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#80:1> Let me have my fun.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#81:1> I'm having fun.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#82:1> I'm paying for it.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#83:1> Who cares?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#84:1> Now I want a big mother of a salmon, and maybe a turkey.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#85:1> Where are they? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#86:1> 4B, she said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#87:1> Half-way along by the big sacks of lamb chops. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#88:1> What'd you get? he asked, and rifled through her cart. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#89:1> What's with all this healthy shit? he asked.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#90:1> Vegetables.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#91:1> You have a million vegetables here.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#92:1> Where's the stuff for the munchies?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#93:1> Where's the lowdown and decadent stuff?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#94:1> Rabbit food.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#95:1> Come on, honey.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#96:1> We <}> <-> gotta </-> <+> got to </+> </}> celebrate. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#97:1> You said I could get what I wanted.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#98:1> I suppose you were planning on sitting down and eating straight meat

with nothing else? <O> illustration </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#99:1> Were you?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#100:1> Is that right?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#101:1> No vegetables, no nothing with it?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#102:1> You get the stupid groceries if you don't like what I'm doing. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#103:1> Honey, you're doing just fine.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#104:1> I'm sorry.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#105:1> I take it back.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#106:1> Go down a different aisle now, though, okay?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#107:1> Go down the frozen foods.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#108:1> You like the frozen food section don't you?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#109:1> I'll come with you. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#110:1> No you won't. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#111:1> Come on. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#112:1> No! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#113:1> Come on, honey.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#114:1> I <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> see your lights come on.

</p>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#115:1> For the millionth time, don't call me honey.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#116:1> I'm Irma.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#117:1> Now go finish your shopping.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#118:1> You have eight square inches of room left in that cart. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#119:1> And ten minutes.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#120:1> See you up front.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#121:1> Ha ha. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#122:1> Ha ha.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#123:1> Don't you follow me. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#124:1> He wasn't at the front in ten minutes, so she went looking for

him.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#125:1> She stopped at the head of an aisle to look at the peanut butter and

jam swirl in the cute jar shaped like a peanut with a strawberry on top and

she saw him.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#126:1> Talking to a girl.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#127:1> The girl was thin.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#128:1> And brown.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#129:1> Little brown legs like a child's.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#130:1> She was standing on one leg like a flamingo, and running her curled

foot up and down her other smooth calf as she talked.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#131:1> Her turquoise cotton tank top dress would be fine for out <l> side,

but inside was too cold with the airconditioning on and so the girl hugged

her arms in front of her, ran her hands up and down her upper arms, but you

could still see her nipples sticking out.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#132:1> When she wasn't rubbing her arms like that, she was running her hand

through her streaked and tangled blonde hair to keep it from falling in her

eyes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#133:1> And he was in his " I'm cool" pose, one arm reach <l> ed up,

resting on the top shelf of the soup cans, legs crossed like he was in a

jeans advertisement.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#134:1> Mean <l> while, blood and water were dripping from the meat in his

cart onto the shiny green linoleum.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#135:1> Irma stood behind the jam for a while, picking up a peanut jar and

putting it back.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#136:1> His eyes flickered up in her direction and she tossed her head and

marched off in search of the Cool Whip she forgot when she must have walked

right past it there why just a second ago. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#137:1> When she got back, he was alone up near the peanut jars.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#138:1> She bumped her cart hard into the side of his in line right by the

peanut butter and jelly swirl.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#139:1> Oops.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#140:1> Sorry, she said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#141:1> What's your problem? he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#142:1> Who was that? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#143:1> Who was who? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#144:1> That girl. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#145:1> Oh her.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#146:1> Just a girl. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#147:1> Ha ha.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#148:1> Very funny.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#149:1> Who is she? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#150:1> A friend of mine. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#151:1> She likes you. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#152:1> Yeah?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#153:1> How can you tell? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#154:1> I could tell. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#155:1> Jealous, are we? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#156:1> That'll be the day. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#157:1> Jealous?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#158:1> Hmm? he grinned and playfully pinched the fat at her waist. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#159:1> Leave me alone.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#160:1> Stop criticizing me. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#161:1> I'm not!
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#162:1> I'm just playing.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#163:1> I love you honey, no matter, no matter what. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#164:1> Thanks.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#165:1> Thanks a lot. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#166:1> Come on, Irma.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#167:1> Let's buy all this stuff and go home and pig out.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#168:1> It'll be fun.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#169:1> What'd you get this time?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#170:1> He saw the frozen chocolate pie, the banana cream pie, and the

cocoanut cream pie.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#171:1> Neapolitan ice cream.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#172:1> Corn in butter sauce.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#173:1> Cauliflower in butter and cheese sauce.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#174:1> Big box of Velveeta.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#175:1> Plain chips, salt and vinegar ripple chips, Bugles, Bits and Bites,

and five kinds of dip: clam, pimento, dill pickle, french onion, and

barbecue.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#176:1> Double chocolate brownie mix and a banana cream pie from the bakery.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#177:1> Cinnamon buns and blueberry muffins. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#178:1> <}> <-> M'boy </-> <+> My boy </+> </}> .
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#179:1> You're really loading up. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#180:1> What's that supposed to mean?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#181:1> You told me to get whatever I wanted.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#182:1> You told me to be more " decadent," Mr. Fancy Word.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#183:1> What's your problem? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#184:1> Nothing.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#185:1> Never mind.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#186:1> Let's get out of here. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#187:1> They each guessed at how much the groceries were going to be and

he was closest at &dollar;478.74 and they each wheeled a cart out to the

trunk and loaded all the stuff in the back.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#188:1> You want one of these here pies right now to hold you till we get

home?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#189:1> Looks pretty tempting, he grinned.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#190:1> She stomped to the cab, got in, and slammed her door shut. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#191:1> Jesus.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#192:1> What'd I do now?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#193:1> And don't slam the door, he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#194:1> I didn't slam it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#195:1> He got in his side and closed the door gently.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#196:1> Like that, he said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#197:1> Like that. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#198:1> What's her name? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#199:1> Huh? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#200:1> The girl.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#201:1> Your friend.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#202:1> What's her name. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#203:1> He looked at her.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#204:1> Smiled with his eyebrows up.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#205:1> You still thinking about her?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#206:1> Her name is Marie. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#207:1> Huh. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#208:1> And she does like me, by the way. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#209:1> Do you like her? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#210:1> She's all right. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#211:1> More all right than me? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#212:1> Jealous? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#213:1> No.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#214:1> More all right than me? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#215:1> No, honey. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#216:1> Don't call me honey. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#217:1> When they were about half-way home, he started humming.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#218:1> What are you humming? she asked.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#219:1> Don't you recognize it? he asked.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#220:1> No.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#221:1> He started singing.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#222:1> <quote> Marie, the dawn is breaking, Marie, you'll soon be wak <l>

ing </quote> &dotted-line; </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#223:1> Shut up, she said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#224:1> Jealous? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#225:1> Not a chance. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#226:1> Marie, the dawn is breaking &dotted-line; </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#227:1> Shut up, I said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#228:1> Marie, you'll soon be waking &dotted-line; </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#229:1> Shut up, she said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#230:1> Shut up.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#231:1> Shut up.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#232:1> He stopped the truck at the stop sign.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#233:1> He nudged and eased the stick shift into neutral with the wide open

palm of his splayed hand, and then he revved the engine.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#234:1> Hot stuff, he said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#235:1> That does it, she said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#236:1> She got out of the cab, slammed the door and climbed in the back.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#237:1> He slid open the win <l> dow behind his head and, putting a

toothpick in his mouth, said, <}> <-> Gonna </-> <+> Going to </+> </}> sit

back there all the way home? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#238:1> What's it to you?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#239:1> You don't care. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#240:1> Come on.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#241:1> I just wanted to get a rise out of you. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#242:1> Didn't work.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#243:1> Turn around.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#244:1> Leave me alone. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#245:1> Fine.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#246:1> Look out for bugs in your teeth. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#247:1> Ha ha.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#248:1> Aren't we funny, she said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#249:1> When they turned onto Sawyer's Crest Road, had almost reached

where the new part started, he started goofing off.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#250:1> Started making big wide curves down the empty road.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#251:1> The paper grocery bags slid and fell over.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#252:1> Smarten up, she yelled through the little cab window.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#253:1> You smarten up. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#254:1> But he didn't.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#255:1> So she reached into the closest shop <l> ping bag and pulled out a

sack of Granny Smith apples.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#256:1> She ripped a hole in the plastic and threw an apple up over the cab

of the truck.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#257:1> It hit the road ahead and bounced off into the gravel.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#258:1> That's your head, she shouted at him.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#259:1> Hey, he shouted from the cab.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#260:1> She threw another apple.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#261:1> Cool it, he shouted.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#262:1> I mean it.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#263:1> So do I, she shouted back.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#264:1> Watch this.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#265:1> And she heaved a bag of frozen peas up and over.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#266:1> This time she didn't throw it far enough and it hit the truck and

split open.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#267:1> Peas rolled down the sides of the hood.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#268:1> This time, without turning around, he gave her the finger out the

back window.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#269:1> Fine then, she thought.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#270:1> Fine and dandy.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#271:1> I'll fix you.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#272:1> She reached into the back again and found his Oreo cookies.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#273:1> See these? she yelled through the crack in the window.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#274:1> See these wonderful cookies?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#275:1> Watch this!
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#276:1> She threw the whole package out the side of the truck into the

ravine.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#277:1> He pulled the truck over to the shoulder. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-002#278:1> He got out, gently shutting the door, toothpick bobbing from

side to side of his mouth.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#279:1> They were on the new part of the road.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#280:1> Their turn off was just a couple more miles ahead.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#281:1> Construction debris, dirt and boards, trees and rocks had been

bulldozed off the new shoulders of the road.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#282:1> The asphalt was still <}> <-> back </-> <+> black </+> </}> and

smelled new.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#283:1> There were no lines on the road.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#284:1> What the hell you doing, smartass? he said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#285:1> She ignored him.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#286:1> She was on her knees now, yanking the fish out of a bag.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#287:1> Quit acting stupid, he said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#288:1> You're acting real stupid, you know.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#289:1> Tough shit, she said, and threw the salmon like a spear down the

hill and into the woods.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#290:1> I'm not going down there to get that, you know, he said. </I> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#X291:1> Tell someone who cares about anything you do or don't do, she said,

chucking a cantaloupe.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#X292:1> Do what you want.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#X293:1> I'm going to do what I want.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#X294:1> She reached into another bag.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#X295:1> With two hands she hoisted the turkey out of the bag.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#X296:1> She stood up in the back of the truck with the turkey raised above

her head.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#X297:1> Irma, he said, Irma, you're being real stupid now.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#X298:1> Irma, that's a whole turkey.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#X299:1> No, Floyd, she said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#X300:1> You're kidding me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-002#X301:1> She stuck out her tongue and bugged her eyes at him, then thrust

forward and heaved the turkey down the embankment and it dis <l> appeared in

the undergrowth. </p> </X>
