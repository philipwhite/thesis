<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#1:1> <h> BRAVE NEW WORLD: astronomers may have detected a new planet </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-030#2:1> By most estimates, the neutron star, or pulsar, known as

PSR1829-10 may not be much to look at.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#3:1> In fact, it cannot be seen at all.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#4:1> Scientists say that the star, located near the centre of the Milky

Way, is a dense, dark orb.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#5:1> It is about 30,000 light years from Earth ( light travels through

space at 5.878 trillion miles per year) and was formed by a supernova

explosion, the spectacular celestial event that occurs when the molten core

of a star implodes, sending shock waves right through the universe.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#6:1> The pulsar, which emits radio waves at regular intervals, was one of

40 such stars discovered in 1985 by scientists at the Nuffield Radio

Astronomy Laboratories at Jodrell Bank, 30 km south of Manchester, in

northern England.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#7:1> Astronomers using Nuffield's giant radio telescope found that sound

pulses emitted by 39 of the neutron stars were unwavering.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#8:1> But the fluctuating responses from the 40th pulsar led them to a

startling conclusion.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#9:1> In a letter published last week by the British journal Nature, they

speculated that the 40th pulsar was being pulled out of its orbit by an

orbiting planet.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#10:1> If that explanation survives the critical scrutiny of the scientific

community, the planet will be the first to be detected outside of Earth's

Solar System. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-030#11:1> Scientists have long predicted that other planetary systems must

exist and would eventually be found somewhere in the universe.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#12:1> But despite some claims in the past, scientists have never been able

to provide conclusive evidence to justify that theory.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#13:1> They said that the apparent discovery of another planetary system

would have important implications for <w> astronomers' </w> understanding of

the universe, and could point the way towards the discovery of other

planetary systems.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#14:1> Said Paul Delaney, a professor of astronomy at Toronto's York

University: <quote> " Until now, we only knew for sure about one planetary

system around one star - the Sun.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#15:1> This changes everything." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-030#16:1> The evidence indicating that PSR1829-10 probably has at least one

orbiting planet was assembled by three Jodrell Bank astronomers, Andrew Lyne,

Matthew Bailes and Setnam Shemar.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#17:1> Lyne told Maclean's that after the observatory identified the new

pulsars six years ago, the lab monitored each of the neutron stars on a

regular basis using its 250-foot-diameter Lovell telescope that receives

radio waves.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#18:1> Neutron stars cannot be seen with an optical telescope because their

light cannot travel far from the galactic centre.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#19:1> But he said that he and his colleagues had noticed during routine

observations with the giant telescope that PSR1829-10 emitted an irregular

pattern of pulses.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#20:1> Lyne said that after they detected that pattern, he and Bailes, an

Australian who began working at the Nuffield Laboratories only 18 months ago,

tested their observations against established mathematical models in an

attempt to explain the fluctuations.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#21:1> Lyne said that it was not until last May that it occurred to them

that they might have discovered a planet.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#22:1> Said Lyne: <quote> " It was a purely serendipitous discovery."

</quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-030#23:1> The Jodrell Bank astronomers said that although the pulsar

usually gave off a regular pattern of pulses, they observed that at times the

pulses would slow by one one-hundredth of a second.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#24:1> Then, three months later, the pulses would speed up again.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#25:1> After recording several cycles, Lyne said, the astronomers concluded

that the pulsar was <quote> " being tugged a bit" </quote> by a planet with

an almost circular, six-month orbit.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#26:1> <quote> " The most natural interpretation of this pulse variation is

that the star has a companion orbiting around it," </quote> Lyne said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-030#27:1> The discovery of another planetary system, which has yet to be

confirmed by other astronomers, came after years of fruitless effort by

astronomers around the world.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#28:1> During the past decade, scientists have been able to look ever deeper

into space with the aid of sophisticated new telescopes capable of producing

high-resolution images of celestial bodies.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#29:1> Still, Delaney said that while these tools have come tantalizingly

close to finding other planetary systems, none has provided enough evidence

to satisfy the scientific community.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#30:1> He said that the powerful telescopes could not overcome the blinding

glare that obscures the view of objects surrounding bright, relatively young

stars, including the Sun.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#31:1> Because the Jodrell Bank telescope responds to radio waves coming

from distant objects in space, rather than light, glare does not affect it.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-030#32:1> Excitement among scientists over the possible detection of

another planetary system was tempered by disappointment that it is too far

away to be seen - and by the fact that the planet is unlikely to support any

form of life.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#33:1> Lyne said that the planet orbiting the pulsar probably has a mass of

about 12 times that of Earth, and a circumference that may be two to three

times that of Earth's.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#34:1> The inspected planet apparently orbits its pulsar sun at a distance

of about 67.24 million miles, roughly equal to the distance between the Sun

and the planet Venus.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#35:1> Astronomers also speculated that the planet is under constant

bombardment by high levels of deadly radiation from its host neutron star.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#36:1> Said Gerald Quinlan, a research associate at the Toronto-based

Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics: <quote> " It is highly

unlikely that any life form could survive in that environment." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-030#37:1> Although other scientists will almost certainly challenge the

Nuffield team's report to see if the interpretation bears scrutiny, some

astronomers said that the evidence provided by Bailes, Lyne and Shemar

appears convincing.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#38:1> <quote> " It is the strongest piece of substantive evidence that our

Solar System is not unique," </quote> Delaney said.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#39:1> For his part, Gordon Walker, a professor of astronomy at the

University of British Columbia, said that the use of a radio telescope in the

Nuffield experiments was similar to being caught speeding by a policeman's

radar gun.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#40:1> <quote> " It is very hard to argue with him when that number appears

on the screen," </quote> Walker said.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#41:1> Still, Lyne said that it was too early to regard his team's findings

as conclusive.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#42:1> <quote> " I think that the observations are secure," </quote> he

said. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#X43:1> <quote> " But there may just be something else going on with that

pulsar." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-030#44:1> If the Nuffield results are verified, the discovery will confront

astronomers with new questions.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#45:1> Walker said that the presence of the planet next to a pulsar

challenges the commonly held belief that a star's planetary system would be

wiped out by the catastrophic explosion of a supernova, which creates a

pulsar.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#46:1> And even if it did survive, many astronomers say that the explosion

should have knocked the planet out of its almost perfectly circular orbit.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#47:1> But Walker said that it was possible that the planet could have been

formed by the debris from the host star's supernova, which occurred about one

million years ago.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#48:1> Said Walker: <quote> " That is not much time to allow a planet to

form out of the debris." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-030#49:1> As scientists studied the Nuffield findings, Lyne, Shemar and

Bailes said that they planned to do new experiments.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#50:1> Lyne said that there is some evidence suggesting that PSR1829-10 may

have more than one planet.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#51:1> But he added that it could take up to 10 years to determine whether

there are other planets.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#52:1> <quote> " It's an exciting concept that our Solar System is not

unique," </quote> he said. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#X53:1> <quote> " It gives us another step forward in projecting our

imaginations into outer space." </quote> </X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#54:1> Clearly, if the theory advanced by Lyne and his colleagues is

correct, many more astronomical horizons remain to be crossed. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#55:1> <h> THE MILKY WAY </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-030#56:1> Planet X is an orbiting object that astronomers say they have

located near a distant pulsar, or neutron star.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#57:1> It may be the first planet to be located outside of Earth's Solar

System.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#58:1> The pulsar, which is about 30,000 light years from the solar system

of which Earth is a part, is located near the centre of the Milky Way.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#59:1> Planet X apparently orbits at about the same distance from the pulsar

as the planet Venus does from the Sun.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#60:1> Unlike planets in Earth's Solar System, Planet X is much larger than

its sun.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#61:1> The dense pulsar rotates at speeds of up to 1,000 revolutions per

second. </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#63:2> <h> THE BIG PICTURE: NASA plans satellites to track the climate </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-030#64:2> As experts increasingly recognize the worldwide nature of

pollution and other environmental hazards, many scientists say that they have

become convinced that the problem must be studied on a global basis.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#65:2> As a result, the Washington-based National Aeronautics and Space

Administration is currently developing six 15-ton satellites, which would be

the largest unmanned spacecraft ever launched by the United States, in order

to study climate patterns and environmental change from space.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#66:2> Called the Earth Observing System ( EOS), the 15-year project,

estimated to cost &dollar;35 billion, will gather data continuously on such

diverse phenomena as polar ice, tropical storms and atmospheric pollutants,

beginning in 1998.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#67:2> Scientists say that they hope the data will lead to important new

discoveries about subjects ranging from tropical rain-forest destruction to

Prairie wheat yields.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#68:2> Said James Drummond, a University of Toronto physicist who is

designing an instrument for the project: <quote> " We need an integrated set

of measurements to understand the continuity of climate change." </quote>

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-030#69:2> The elaborate EOS satellites will collect enough information on

the Earth's environment every day to fill the memories of 50,000 personal

computers.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#70:2> Advocates of the project also maintain that the data will vastly

improve the accuracy of assessing environmental problems, leading to possible

scientific solutions.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#71:2> Since NASA proposed the project in 1988, hundreds of scientists from

more than 15 countries, including Canada, have begun designing equipment that

may eventually be used on the satellites.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#72:2> Said Gordon McBean, a University of British Columbia climatologist

who is regarded as a world authority on climate change: <quote> " We need a

massive global experiment like EOS to deal with the Earth as a system."

</quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-030#73:2> But other scientists claim that megaprojects like EOS consume too

much research money and talent.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#74:2> Andrew Lacis, a New York City-based climatologist with the Goddard

Institute for Space Studies, said that an entire scientific discipline can

suffer when a megaproject fails to perform according to expectations.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#75:2> He noted that NASA's &dollar;1.85-billion Hubble Space Telescope,

launched in April, will take three more years to achieve its design potential

because the main mirror has failed to focus accurately the light that strikes

it from outer space.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#76:2> Said Lacis: <quote> " Megaprojects have a way of slipping and being

delayed and going wrong." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-030#77:2> So far, the scientific community has supported NASA's proposal to

have EOS in operation in eight years.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#78:2> If that happens, there will eventually be two satellites always in

north-south orbit around the Earth at an altitude of nearly 440 miles.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#79:2> Each spacecraft will pass near the poles once a day, and some of its

instruments will gather data across a 700-mile-wide swath of the Earth's

surface.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#80:2> The first satellite will probably monitor changes in vegetation, ice

cover and precipitation, while the second, scheduled for launching before the

year 2000, would measure such natural phenomena as continental drift,

atmospheric ozone levels, wind speeds and temperatures. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-030#81:2> Canadian scientists have eagerly joined the competition to design

equipment that could be used on board the satellites or as ground-based

support.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#82:2> The U of T's Drummond is developing an instrument to measure carbon

monoxide and methane, two atmospheric gases that may be important factors in

climate change.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#83:2> Drummond said that the instrument is among 20 being designed for use

on the first satellite.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#84:2> He added that NASA plans to select 12 to 16 devices by the end of

this month.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#85:2> Meanwhile, the Ottawa-based Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, a

branch of Energy, Mines and Resources, is leading several global-change

studies that incorporate and interpret the data collected from EOS.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#86:2> Said Barry Goodison, co-ordinator of space programs at Environment

Canada's Canadian Climate Centre, and one of 35 Canadian scientists involved

in the studies: <quote> " We see this as an opportunity to push Canada into

more Earth observation research." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-030#87:2> Many scientists say that EOS could lead to international action

on global pollution.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-030#88:2> Ellsworth LeDrew, a University of Waterloo, Ont., geography professor

who is involved in the Canada Climate Centre's studies, said that scientists

must provide a clearer understanding of the extent and causes of

environmental damage before governments can be expected to take co-ordinated

action. </p> </I>
