<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#2:1> Action-Prevention Valcartier held its first meeting on March 18

and attracted over 70 citizens, as well as the mayor of Valcartier and some

of its councillors, including Ludwig Fitzpatrick, council liaison with the

crime prevention group. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#3:1> Two representatives from Astronicor, an alarm company, also

attended to talk about their products. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#4:1> Co-ordinator Tim Brown says that since the meeting, the mail box

set up to receive anonymous tips on crimes committed has already received

important information. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#5:1> The committee now has a permanent office at <@> 9999 Smith</@>

Boulevard; its telephone number is <@> 555-5050</@>. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#6:1> Brown reminds Valcartier residents that if they have a break-in or

are otherwise the victims of crime, they should first phone the

S&ucircumflex;ret&eacute;, then notify the Action-Prevention office. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#7:1> Three police officers who live in Valcartier are also working with

the committee. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#8:2> <h> <bold> Plan protects anglo services </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#9:2> <bold> By Alfredo Brandolino </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#10:2> Quebec's Health and Social Services Minister, Marc-Yvan

C&ocircumflex;t&eacute;, presented a four-point plan before the Permanent

Commission on Social Affairs last Tuesday, outlining where cultural

communities - including anglophones - will fit in his sweeping health reform

known as Bill 120. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#11:2> The awaited amendments addressing minority community concerns

were not tabled before the commission.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#12:2> The four points are rather principles which <quote> " reflect the

close consultation the minister and his staff have had with cultural

communities and anglophone groups over the past several months," </quote>

said Liberal MNA Russ Williams, parliamentary assistant to the health

minister. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#13:2> The four principles are: <l> - to ensure that English-speaking

people, wherever they are in the province, have access to health and social

services. <l> - to ensure the integrity of the province's network of

English-language institutions. <l> - to ensure anglophone representation on

regional and institutional boards. <l> - to put in place budget allocation

<l> - to put in place budget allocation mechanisms to achieve these points.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#14:2> " I hope there will be no opposition to these points ( in the

National Assembly).
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#15:2> It is not a political issue.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#16:2> It's a service issue," said Williams. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#17:2> Williams recalled that Bill 142, the 1986 law ensuring health and

social services to Quebec's anglophones, had to be brought in with closure

because there was so much opposition to it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#18:2> Sara Saber, who heads a team studying the reform at Alliance

Quebec in Montreal, while encouraged by the direction the health minister is

taking, expressed concern over anglophone representation on the powerful new

regional boards created under the reform by unifying institutions under

single boards. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#19:2> Harry Hannon, director general of St. Brigid's Home, said his

institution has already been recognized by the local regional council as

having an independent role to play in the region's health care system.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#20:2> " Our first apprehensions have been cleared up," he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#21:2> Saber said that any independent board status for anglophone

institutions " should be clearly written into the law as a guarantee." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#22:2> Saber also wants a specific mechanism written into the law " to

compensate for any lack of ( minority group) representation on regional

boards," she said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#23:2> That mechanism can be in the form of a co-opting system, whereby

the 20-member boards, once formed, must add an unspecified number of

anglophone or cultural community members to their ranks. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#24:2> Another mechanism would involve direct ministerial nomination of

minority group members to boards.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#25:2> In either case, there must be governmental accountability, said

Saber. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#26:2> " Our experience is that when there is no government

accountability nothing happens," she said. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#36:4> <bold> By Richard Campbell </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#37:4> The cubs and scouts of St. Vincent visited the resource centre at

St. Lawrence Campus.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#38:4> The librarian, Louise Petryk, explained to the boys that a library is

not just a place with lots of books, but it also has all kinds of materials

on all kinds of subjects. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#39:4> The St. Lawrence resource centre has a collection of 28,000

books, 300 magazine titles as well as a computer program, sound recordings,

slides, video recordings and pamphlets. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#40:4> The librarian explained to the boys that catalogues are very

important tools.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#41:4> Once you know how to use them, you'll be able to do better

assignments, more class projects and get higher marks on exams.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#42:4> They are the keys to the library. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#43:4> Several of the cubs and scouts got their membership cards at the

library that evening.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#44:4> It's an excellent way to encourage our youngsters to read. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#45:4> After the visit, the boys had a snack and refreshments. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#46:4> The St. Vincent's group would like to thank Louise Petryk for her

time and interest in helping us earn our star requirement.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#47:4> We enjoyed and learned a lot at the meeting. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#48:4> Next week, the cubs and scouts will be going to Mont St-Sacrement

for their winter camp.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#49:4> We have planned a fun weekend of different winter activities and the

boys are always busy working for another badge. </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#51:5> <h> <bold> Don't ignore child's drug experiments </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#52:5> By Diane Kameen </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#53:5> What a shame that hundreds of people didn't come out to hear the

words of Gilles Vinet at the lecture entitled How to Talk to Your Kids About

Drugs, sponsored by Voice of English Quebec last Monday, March 18. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#54:5> Vinet is a counsellor at the Maison <@> Chanel</@>, a <}> <+>

rehabilitation </+> <-> tation </-> </}> centre for youth aged 12 to 18.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#55:5> Every day he deals with the effects of drug abuse on the young people

of Quebec City, and it's no pretty picture.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#56:5> " These kids have a choice; either they stop doing drugs or they end

up in prison, insane or dead," he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#57:5> Contrary to what you might like to believe, Quebec City is no

better than any other Canadian city of its size.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#58:5> Drugs are available here and, as growing <}> <-> techniqyes </-> <+>

techniques </+> </}> are perfected, they're getting more dangerous with each

passing year.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#59:5> Marijuana is " out"; cocaine and a potent strain of hashish are "

in". </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#60:5> According to the Health and Welfare Canada video called <it>

Dialogue on Drugs </it> , the term <mention> " drugs" </mention> also

encompasses tobacco, alcohol and inhalants such as gasoline and aerosol cans.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#61:5> If you suspect that your child is experimenting with these

substances, don't ignore the problem by saying to yourself that it's a normal

part of growing up.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#62:5> This will send out the signal to your child that you don't care.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#63:5> Rather, you should talk to him or her about it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#64:5> There are many reasons why children try drugs - peer pressure,

curiosity, lack of self-esteem, boredom and adult influence, the latter being

the most difficult to deal with.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#65:5> Parents must set a good example for their children. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#66:5> As Gilles Vinet says, " We must let our kids 'go', but we must be

their guiding influence.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#67:5> They are the arrow, we are the sturdy bow that points them towards an

end.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#68:5> We're not quite sure where that end is, but this is the only thing we

can do as parents." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#69:5> Over 80 per cent of the youth that come to the maison <@>

Chanel</@> for treatment bring their families with them.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#70:5> There is almost always a problem in the way the family functions as a

unit, such as communication difficulties, a parent who suffers from substance

abuse, and/or a grandparent. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#71:5> According to Vinet, a few short years of heavy drug abuse can do

more damage to a person than 20 years of alcoholism. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#72:5> Another terrifying fact is that if a child begins to consume

drugs at the age of nine, his or her mental development will freeze at that

age.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#73:5> " We deal regularly with 18-year-olds who are operating with

pre-adolescent minds," he says. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#74:5> Once a person breaks the pattern of denial and admits that he/she

has a problem, he is on the road to recovery.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#75:5> At the very least, they will never consume that substance in the same

way again - without a feeling of wrongness.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#76:5> Addicts must be extremely careful not to substitute one thing for

another, like taking up drugs after having stopped drinking.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#77:5> Even eating can become an addiction. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#78:5> Vinet says that, although it is reality, you cannot tell an

addict that he/she can never touch any type of drug ( including alcohol)

again; it's too overwhelming to handle. </p>

problem, contact La Maison <@> Chanel</@> at <@> 555-9090</@>. </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#82:6> <h> St. Pat's Irish Show was hint of spring </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#83:6> By Joanne Carver </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#84:6> As winter draws to a close, and the days become longer, we

anxiously look for those first signs of spring to help boost our morale.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#85:6> One of the first signs to appear each year and certainly one of the

most appreciated, is the annual St. Pat's High School St. Patrick's Day Show.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#86:6> This year's show was held on three different occasions.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#87:6> The first presentation was held on March 13 for the patients at the

Jeffery Hale's Hospital and the second show was held on March 14 at St.

Brigid's Home. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#88:6> Both shows were well attended and much appreciated by those who

were not able to attend the main performance on Friday, March 15, in the

basement hall of St. Patrick's Church. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#89:6> And what a great show it was, with the active participation of

approximately 70 of St. Pat's finest students and teachers. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#90:6> Sixteen Irish melodies were sung, played and danced to, for the

appreciative full capacity crowd, all of whom were Irish - at least for the

evening. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#91:6> The highlight of the evening was the first public performance of

the St. Pat's junior and senior school bands.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#92:6> Under the able direction of Helen McCauley, the music teacher.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#93:6> The junior band played <it> Danny Boy </it> followed by the senior

band which played <it> Four Leaf Clover </it> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#94:6> This is the first year for St. Pat's music program and its

initial success has made the principal, Patrick McKenna, most happy. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#95:6> " Music will eventually be offered as a concentration to some

students," McKenna said. </p> </I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-011#107:7> Furthermore, to add that final touch, a satin ribbon in purple,

green or navy enhances the pillow slip's border.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-011#108:7> You can choose between two types of material: 50 per cent cotton /
