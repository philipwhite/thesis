<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#158:1:B> So <,> uhm <,> but now of course I'm sorry that we ever let

it go
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#159:1:B> It's too bad

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#160:1:A> Ya I think Mom wishes she spoke more Japanese <{1> <[1> too

<,> </[1> and wishes that <,,> we had learned my sister
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#161:1:A> <{2> <[2> and I </[2> but

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#162:1:B> <[1> Mhh hmm </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#163:1:B> <[2> Mhh </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#164:1:B> So have you ever taken a trip over there

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#165:1:A> Uh once when I was fifteen years old I went with uh <,> Dad
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#166:1:A> And <}> <-> I </-> <=> you </=> </}> arrive at what is it <}> <->

<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#168:1:B> Mhh </[> </{> hmm
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#169:1:B> And uh <,> got off the airplane and thought there's a lot of

Japanese people around here
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#170:1:B> It really strikes ya <{> <[> right </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#171:1:B> <[> I bet it </[> </{> does

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#172:1:A> You've never experienced it <{> <[> before </[> and <}> <->

it's </-> <=> it's </=> </}> quite a shock

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#173:1:B> <[> Ya </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#174:1:B> Did you feel <}> <-> <.> minor </.> </-> <=> like you were a

minority </=> </}> <{> <[> when you were </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#175:1:A> <[> Well uh <,> </[> </{> physically I wasn't <{> <[>

obviously </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#176:1:B> <[> No </[> </{> but verbally

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#177:1:A> But verbally I couldn't communicate with them at all
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#178:1:A> <}> <-> I had this long <.> t </.> </-> <=> uh teenagers </=> </}>

in the late seventies early <{1> <[1> eighties </[1> had <}> <-> long </->

<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#179:1:A> <{2> <[2> hair </[2> right

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#180:1:B> <[1> Oh yes </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#181:1:B> <[2> Hair </[2> </{2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#182:1:A> So <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> stood out that way <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#183:1:A> And apparently I was wearing messy Canadian <{1> <[1> clothes that

were unironed and everything
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#184:1:A> And so people like <}> <-> I </[1> </-> <=> my </=> </}> cousins

were telling me that I was kind of
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#185:1:A> <{2> <[2> <,,> a sore thumb that way too </[2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#186:1:B> <[1> <O> laugh </O> </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#187:1:B> <[2> <O> laugh </O> </[2> </{2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#188:1:A> But <,,> it was interesting

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#189:1:B> Ya I found it was

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#190:1:A> <}> <-> I uh </-> <=> I </=> </}> didn't like eating rice

three times a day
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#191:1:A> <{1> <[1> My dad </[1> loved it
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#192:1:A> <{2> <[2> but </[2> <}> <-> I <,> I couldn't </-> <=> I couldn't

</=> </}> be bothered

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#193:1:B> <[1> Ya </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#194:1:B> <[2> Ya </[2> </{2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#195:1:A> And the bread that they had over there at the time was really

atrocious

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#196:1:B> Oh is that right

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#197:1:A> <{> <[> Ya </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#198:1:B> <[> We </[> </{> didn't have any store bought bread
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#199:1:B> Uhm <,> the families we stayed with had bread machines

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#200:1:A> <{> <[> Oh really </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#201:1:B> <[> So of course </[> </{> they made their own
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#202:1:B> Ya <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#203:1:B> That's what you woke up to
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#204:1:B> The fragrance of <,> home baked bread <,,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#205:1:A> Well <?> things </?> have changed <{> <[> <,> since I went

there <O> laugh </O> way back when </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#206:1:B> <[> Ya <O> laugh </O> </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#207:1:B> So <}> <-> you're </-> <=> you </=> </}> have family there

<-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> two younger sisters are there </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#209:1:B> And the younger sister has kids so

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#210:1:B> Oh ya

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#211:1:A> Two of my cousins have come to study in Canada
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#212:1:A> To study English
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#213:1:A> And uh <,,> they were pretty funny
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#214:1:A> They you know they were typical Japanese young people wearing

these t-shirts with <,> these really nonsensical English words <{> <[> <O>

laugh </O> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#215:1:B> <[> Yes <,,> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#216:1:A> <{> <[> And and you know </[> you'd ask them <,> what does

that mean you know

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#217:1:B> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#218:1:A> And they'd say it doesn't mean anything
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#219:1:A> We just like having English on our <{> <[> clothes okay
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#220:1:A> So get off our case </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#221:1:B> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#222:1:B> And some of <{> <[> the things </[> that are on there are just

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#223:1:A> <[> <O> cough </O> </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#224:1:B> Oh dear
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#225:1:B> But they like it

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#227:1:B> <}> <-> <[> <.> Wha </.> </[> </{> </-> <=> Whatever </=>

</}> it says it doesn't matter
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#228:1:B> It doesn't matter at all

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#229:1:A> We were in uh <,> Hiroshima I think it was and there were

some <,> white guys
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#230:1:A> I assume they were Americans

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#231:1:B> <{> <[> Mhh hmm </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#232:1:A> <[> So I went up </[> </{> and chatted with them and <,>

after a couple minutes one guy said jeez you speak pretty good English <{>

<[> and I said thanks <O> laugh </O> </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#234:1:A> It's pretty funny

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#235:1:B> Ya <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> would've liked to have uh

gone down to Hiroshima but <}> <-> I </-> <=> <,,> we </=> </}> just didn't

have the time
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#236:1:B> We spent some time in Kyoto <{> <[> <,,> </[> and uhm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#237:1:A> <[> <}> <-> Awright </-> <+> Alright </+> </}> </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#238:1:A> Well that's a city to go to

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#239:1:B> Ya <,> it's a beautiful city
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#240:1:B> And uh <,> we uh <,> decided one morning we were going to walk and

see <,> a few things
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#241:1:B> And we walked and walked and walked <,,> and uh <,> finally we

found uh <,> uh <}> <-> a spot that we really wanted to </-> <=> one of the

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#243:1:B> And uh so when we came out of there <@> Bernie </@> said uh

we're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> have to take a taxi back to

the <{> <[> hotel
<ICE-CAN:S1A-055#244:1:B> I am so tired </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#245:1:A> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-055#246:1:B> So we <,> got the taxi and within minutes we were back at the

hotel </I>
