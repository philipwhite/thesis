<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-017#240:3:A> Give your observations on that photograph <,> that you took

<,,> and then you can give the observations on the one <,,> I took <,> of you

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-017#241:3:B> Alright <,> let's start with <@> Amanda </@> then

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-017#242:3:A> Do you want me to start

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-017#243:3:B> Yes <,,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-017#244:3:A> I think it's an incredibly <,> beautiful photograph <,,> of a

</-> <=> a </=> </}> strange overgrown rock garden <,> wearing <}> <-> a <,>

</-> <=> a </=> </}> wreath of <,> dandelions <,,> and she's so innocent and

so beautiful and <,,> so unfolding
<ICE-CAN:S1A-017#245:3:A> And what I'm going to do with this is I'm going to get an eight by

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-017#246:3:B> Right right does she remind you a lot of <@> Chloe </@> there

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-017#247:3:A> No not in the least <,> absolutely

<ICE-CAN:S1A-017#249:3:A> She doesn't resemble <@> Chloe </@> in the least <,,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-017#250:3:B> I always thought she did

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-017#251:3:A> So what do you think of my photograph <unclear> word

</unclear>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-017#252:3:B> I love it that's why I'm getting the triptych made <,> and

</}> look great
<ICE-CAN:S1A-017#253:3:B> And uhh I still like the idea that it looks as though I'm falling

<,> that I haven't hit the ground
<ICE-CAN:S1A-017#254:3:B> I don't <,> quite know why that optical illusion happens but it

<ICE-CAN:S1A-017#255:3:B> <}> <-> That uh </-> <=> that's </=> </}> I suppose is a little

</}> look very relaxed <,,> I think

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-017#257:3:A> <unclear> words </unclear> I just mention that uh in fact I

showed it to <,,> the psychoanalyst yesterday that photograph and said <,>

that I didn't have the <,,> technical skills to photograph myself <,,> lying

face down in a field of <,> dandelions and cut grass <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-017#258:3:A> But I should point the fact that <}> <-> it's </-> <=> it's </=>

</}> symbolic it's myself <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-017#259:3:A> It's what it is it's the Fall of Icarus <,,> flying too <,> close

to the sun and becoming unglued and <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-017#260:3:A> And that's my life <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-017#261:3:A> I tried to fly too close to the sun and <{> <[> <,,> became
