<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#1:1> <h> Choosing judges in private </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-020#2:1> By his own admission, Willard Estey was a compromise choice for

the Supreme Court of Canada.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#3:1> <quote> " They happened to need a guy from Ontario and they couldn't

agree on who," </quote> recalled Estey of his 1977 appointment to the Supreme

Court bench just nine months after becoming Ontario's chief justice.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#4:1> The deadlock was resolved, said Estey, who at the time was reluctant

to leave the Ontario court, by <quote> " grabbing the Ontario chief justice."

</quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#5:1> Now retired from the Supreme Court and practising law in Toronto, the

highly regarded former judge added: <quote> " I got moved into that job the

same way I was moved around by the Air Force during the war." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#6:1> And Estey, like all other justices of Canada's top court, began his

new job without being subjected to the public examination that U.S. Supreme

Court nominees have to undergo according to the American Constitution. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-020#7:1> Canadian Supreme Court judges are named by the governor general on

the advice of the prime minister.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#8:1> The only fixed requirements are that at least three of the judges must

be members of the Quebec bar, and that any appointee must have been a member

of a Canadian bar for at least 10 years.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#9:1> As well, all federal judges have been screened since 1967 by the

Canadian Bar Association and, since 1988, by a five-member advisory committee

made up of federal and provincial legal authorities that privately assesses

candidates. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-020#10:1> In practice, the power to shape the composition of the Supreme

Court has rested with the prime minister, who is under no legal obligation to

follow the advisory committee's recommendations.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#11:1> Since Prime Minister Brian Mulroney took office in 1984, he has

appointed eight of the nine current justices, and some Canadians have

complained that the present appointment process could allow a prime minister

to stack the court with political friends.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#12:1> As a result, some critics of the system have urged the introduction

of a public review process for prospective justices.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#13:1> Said Frederick Vaughan, a political science professor at Ontario's

University of Guelph: <quote> " With the introduction of the charter of

rights in 1982, these people exercise extraordinary power. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#X14:1> They should undergo some measure of public scrutiny by our

legislators. </X> " </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-020#15:1> But other experts contend that such a process would merely graft

another element of the U.S. political system onto Canada's parliamentary form

of government.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#16:1> And even those calling for changes to the system, including Vaughan,

acknowledge that all Supreme Court justices since the 1960s have been well

qualified.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#17:1> <quote> " The legal community does a very good job of regulating

itself and weeding out bad lawyers," </quote> said Vaughan.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#18:1> But as the influence of the Supreme Court grows, calls for an open

review of new judges may increase. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#19:2> <h> THE WAR OF THE SEXES: new calls for rules on sexual harassment

</h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-020#20:2> The 44-year-old black woman, who took her complaint to Ontario's

<w> Workers' </w> Compensation Board, said that she was constantly harassed

during a six-year period in the 1980s by male co-workers at the

Colgate-Palmolive Canada soap factory in the Toronto area.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#21:2> The woman, whose name was not made public, worked on a packing line

and said that men there would frequently leave obscene drawings in her

locker, make racist and sexist remarks and, in one incident, gave her a piece

of soap carved in the form of a penis.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#22:2> Despite a complaint to her union and to the company's management, the

woman said that she received little support and eventually suffered a nervous

breakdown.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#23:2> In June, 1990, in a precedent-setting decision, the <w> Workers' </w>

Compensation Board hearings officer ordered the company to pay an

as-yet-undetermined amount for illnesses that stemmed from the stress of

enduring sexual harassment on the job.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#24:2> Colgate officials vowed to fight the award, but late last month

withdrew their appeal.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#25:2> The landmark case opened up another avenue <unclear> one word

</unclear> complaint for victims of sexual harassment in the workplace.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#26:2> Still, many experts say that it remains widespread in Canadian

society - and often is not dealt with seriously enough. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-020#27:2> The dramatic confrontation this month between University of

Oklahoma law professor Anita Hill and her former employer, U.S. Supreme Court

nominee Clarence Thomas, focused new attention on the issue.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#28:2> After Hill testified before the Senate judiciary committee in

Washington that Thomas harassed her by repeatedly asking for dates, boasting

of his sexual prowess and describing pornographic movies, the Senate last

week ratified Thomas's appointment to the court by a vote of 52 to 48. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-020#29:2> For its part, the Supreme Court of Canada, in deciding a case in

1989, defined sexual harassment as <quote> " unwelcome conduct of a sexual

nature that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse

job-related consequences for the victims of the harassment." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#30:2> According to studies carried out in the United States and Canada,

sexual harassment in the workplace affects an estimated 80 to 90 per cent of

women at some point in their lives.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#31:2> ( Only a small number of men ever complain of sexual harassment.)
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#32:2> In 1990, federal and provincial human rights commissions received

hundreds of complaints of sexual harassment in the workplace.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#33:2> Said Maxwell Yalden, chief commissioner of the federal human rights

commission: <quote> " It is a problem that is very much present and very much

felt by women across the country." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#34:2> He added: <quote> " Whatever the numbers are, it's a shattering

experience for the individual." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-020#35:2> Telling jokes, putting an arm around a co-worker or asking a

colleague for a date is not, according to experts in the field, unacceptable

behavior in the right context.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#36:2> But they concede that what does constitute sexual harassment in the

workplace is difficult for some people to grasp.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#37:2> Experts say that the offending behavior typically takes one of two

forms.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#38:2> The first occurs when there is an implied or explicit link between

requested sexual favors and a promotion or job security.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#39:2> The second form of harassment occurs when a person - particularly a

superior - subjects an employee to unwelcome attentions that create a

poisoned, uncomfortable or hostile working environment.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#40:2> <quote> " It is much more subtle than most people think," </quote>

said lawyer and criminologist Judith Osborne, harassment policy co-ordinator

at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#41:2> <X> <quote> " It's not always the blatant touching, feeling or making

sexual requests.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#X42:2> It's often wrapped up as a joke - often not a very funny joke."

</quote> </X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#43:2> Osborne added: <quote> " In many workplaces, those kinds of off-color

conversations - the sort of dissecting of people's sex lives - is seen as

being the regular Monday-morning conversation." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-020#44:2> Many experts say that the reason sexual harassment has become

more of an issue in recent years is the increasing number of women in the

workforce.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#45:2> The resulting change in rules for workplace behavior, they add, has

confused many men.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#46:2> <quote> " Men say, 'Anyone could accuse me of sexual harassment and I

didn't mean to do it at all,' </quote> " said Nancy Adamson, co-ordinator for

the status of women and a sexual-harassment adviser at Carleton University in

Ottawa.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#47:2> <X> <quote> " I say, think about whether you would like someone to do

this to your mother, your daughter, your wife.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#X48:2> And if you feel uneasy at all about the behavior, stop it." </quote>

</X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#49:2> Adamson and others concede that it is difficult to make people fully

understand the seriousness of sexual harassment.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#50:2> Added Adamson: <quote> " There's no reverse situation. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#X51:2> You can't say to men, 'Imagine if a woman were doing this to you.'
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#X52:2> It's not the same thing. </X> " </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-020#53:2> Still, some critics maintain that existing definitions of sexual

harassment are too vague and can have the effect of trapping innocent people.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#54:2> <quote> " When is a look a leer?" </quote> said Howard Levitt, a

Toronto lawyer who specializes in wrongful-dismissal suits.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#55:2> <X> <quote> " When is an invitation to dinner a come-on?" </quote>

</X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#56:2> Levitt also claims that the potential exists for people to

frivolously accuse someone of sexual harassment.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#57:2> Explained Levitt: <quote> " The very fact of the allegation is so

destructive to their career that the person who is being accused is likely to

pay a tremendous amount of money to keep the accuser quiet." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-020#58:2> The effects of genuine sexual harassment on a victim can be

devastating according to experts.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#59:2> <quote> " It has a real, sinister, debilitating kind of effect on

one's self-esteem," </quote> said Debi Forsyth-Smith, president of the

Halifax-based Nova Scotia Advisory Council on the Status of Women.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#60:2> <X> <quote> " People say, 'Why is this happening to me?'
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#X61:2> And sexual harassment generally happens in isolation, behind a

closed door when nobody else is around." </quote> </X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#62:2> As well, victims are often harassed by superiors.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#63:2> Said Adamson: <quote> " When you are in a position of power and you

start touching or making sexual jokes or innuendoes, those under you have to

think about their position before they challenge your behavior." </quote>

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-020#64:2> Following through with a formal complaint in Canada can be a

daunting and lengthy process for sexual-harassment victims.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#65:2> According to Yalden, the victim will usually file a complaint with

the federal or provincial human rights commission against both the alleged

harasser and the employer ( under Canadian law, employers have a

responsibility for a harassment-free workplace).
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#66:2> If officials believe that there are grounds for the complainant's

case, they will begin gathering evidence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-020#67:2> Throughout the process, Yalden explained, the commission will

make every attempt to arrive at an informal settlement between the parties.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#68:2> If none can be reached, the commission will, if warranted, appoint a

conciliator to try to find a settlement.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#69:2> Failing that, a tribunal can be established to hear testimony in

public.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#70:2> Finally, the board reaches a conclusion and issues an order, which

could involve the awarding of financial damages, the reinstatement of a job

or the granting of a promotion that was previously denied as a result of the

complainant's refusal to comply with the harasser's demands.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#71:2> The employer and the individual charged with harassment could then

appeal the commission's decision before the courts.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#72:2> In some cases, the process can take years before all the appeals have

been heard and a final ruling has been rendered. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-020#73:2> Some experts maintain that victims of sexual harassment in the

workplace are not served well under the current system.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#74:2> Because sexual harassment is not a criminal offence, a complainant

has no recourse but to go to a human rights commission.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#75:2> In most provinces, commissions have large backlogs of cases.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#76:2> Another problem, according to Levitt, is that the commissions tend to

<quote> " give notoriously puny awards for anything other than proof of

economic loss." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#77:2> Financial damages typically range from &dollar;250 to &dollar;3,000.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#78:2> Indeed, the consequences of filing a complaint may outweigh the

benefits.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#79:2> Complainants, said Levitt, <quote> " have to go to the human rights

commission, make a complaint, prove they're harassed, wait a number of years

and, even if they win, it might be difficult to get a job somewhere else

because they're seen as shit-disturbers." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#80:2> But ultimately, experts agree, most victims of sexual harassment are

really only seeking one thing: for the offensive behavior to stop. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#81:3> <h> BLACKENED BLUE: scandal strikes the Edmonton police force </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-020#82:3> Edmonton Police Chief Douglas McNally seemed shaken last week

when he appeared in public at his headquarters.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#83:3> Just 3 hours earlier, Edmonton detectives had arrested one of their

own, Const. Roy Gordon Lawrence, 33, in a car a few blocks from his home in

St. Albert, a suburb of the Alberta capital.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#84:3> Charged with kidnapping and sexually assaulting two eight-year-old

boys and a 10-year-old girl, Lawrence was immediately suspended without pay

from his beat at the West Edmonton Mall shopping centre.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#85:3> McNally, who said that he and the Edmonton police force were

embarrassed by the case, declared that the matter was an <quote> " isolated

incident" </quote> and insisted that the vast majority of his officers

possessed <quote> " high moral standards." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#86:3> But some Edmontonians expressed concern.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#87:3> <quote> " You teach your kids that the police are their friends and

you go to them when you are in trouble," </quote> said Guy L'Heureux, 38, an

Edmonton housepainter.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#88:3> <X> <quote> " Then something like this happens." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-020#89:3> Lawrence's arrest followed several recent scandals that McNally

acknowledged had shaken public confidence in the Edmonton force.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#90:3> Twice during the past two months, city policemen have been charged

with drinking-and-driving-related offences.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#91:3> And in June, Const. Jens Goldgrabe, 30, was sentenced to six years in

prison after being convicted of sexually assaulting a suspected shoplifter.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#92:3> Goldgrabe, whom McNally called <quote> " a disgrace to the uniform,"

</quote> had forced the handcuffed woman to perform oral sex on him and call

him <quote> " master." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#93:3> In another incident the previous month, a judge authorized private

charges of assault and torture against three police officers who allegedly

roughed up a 32-year-old man on the steps of a courthouse in May, 1990. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-020#94:3> Other scandals have also hit the Edmonton police force in recent

years.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#95:3> In 1989, Const. Jerry Donovan, 34, who had been charged with the

sexual assault of a female officer in 1988, shot and killed his wife, Const.

Shannon Donovan, 28, before fatally shooting himself.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-020#96:3> In the same year, Hans Bredeman, 40, a 17-year veteran of the

department, was sentenced to 15 years in prison after being convicted of

devising a plan that resulted in his mistress shooting and injuring his wife,

Faye. </p> </I>
