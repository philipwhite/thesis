<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#2:1> <h> <it> Edmonton opts to keep the Muni, but the vote might be in vain

</it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#3:1> After weeks of hand-wringing and con <l> fusion, Edmontonians last

week took aim at a proposal to consolidate their two airports and shot it out

of the sky.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#4:1> The decision to move all passenger flights from the municipal airport

- just over a mile from the city centre - to the larger interna <l> tional

airport - 13 miles south of the city - was made by city council in June.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#5:1> A group called Air Services for Tomorrow collected 45,000 signatures

opposing the move, forc <l> ing a referendum.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#6:1> On election day, 54% of voters opted to keep the Muni open.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#7:1> But the vote, which cost the city an estimated &dollar;100,000, may

prove meaningless. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#8:1> The referendum was dogged by contro <l> versy from the outset.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#9:1> Critics charged the Edmonton Regional Airports Authority ( ERAA)

browbeat the city into backing consolidation, and that economic studies

commissioned by the city were biased and inaccurate.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#10:1> And polls showed as many as one-third of city voters didn't

understand the referendum question. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#11:1> Council first approached the ERAA - a government-appointed agency

controlling the international airport - in 1990, propos <l> ing that the

group take control of the city-administered municipal.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#12:1> In March, ERAA replied that it would, but only if all passen <l> ger

flights were moved to the larger inter <l> national.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#13:1> Consolidation would cut airport costs, increase the number of direct

flights serving the city and help stem the emer <l> gence of Calgary as

Alberta's airline hub.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#14:1> Council eventually agreed to the plan in an 8-4 vote. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#15:1> Air Services for Tomorrow, led by former provincial cabinet

minister Dave King, re <l> sponded with an aggressive campaign to save the

Muni.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#16:1> " There is no reason I can see to consolidate flights, and every

reason not to," he said.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#17:1> " We'd lose 900 jobs and as much as &dollar;7 million in revenue.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#18:1> And for what?
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#19:1> Nobody can say." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#20:1> Voters sided with Mr. King, much to the delight of Calgary.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#21:1> <quote> " The vote will cement forever Edmonton's second-rate

standing as an air centre in Alberta," </quote> wrote <it> Calgary Herald

</it> columnist Don Braid.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#22:1> <quote> " Edmonton will remain a spoke to Calgary's hub." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#23:1> Indeed, just two days after the vote, Air Canada announced that it

was dropping non-stop service between Edmonton and Ottawa, and routing the

city's red-eye flight to Toronto through Calgary. </p> <O> photograph </O>

</O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#24:1> The electorate's wishes for the Muni may also prove pointless.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#25:1> According to Peter Watson, ERAA's chairman, the Air Can <l> ada and

Canadian Airlines merger will re <l> sult in consolidation regardless of what

the city does.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#26:1> The merged airline, he says, could save &dollar;15 million by flying

out of a single airport, a bonanza the cash-strapped company is unlikely to

pass up.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#27:1> ERAA will work to convince it to choose the interna <l> tional.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#28:1> If that happens, he says, the munici <l> pal would start to lose

money by the planeload, a loss city taxpayers would have to absorb. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#32:2> Most political veterans say that a low voter turnout signals

either frus <l> trated pessimism with the system, or that people are so

content that they are compla <l> cent.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#33:2> At 34%, the municipal turnout in Calgary last week was the city's

lowest in 25 years.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#34:2> So, despite valiant efforts by both the <it> Calgary Herald </it> and

<it> Calgary Sun </it> to detect the dawn of a New Age in the over <l>

whelming return of Mayor Al Duerr, along with 11 of 12 incum <l> bent

aldermen, it would appear simply that Calgarians are content with their cor

<l> ner of the world.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#35:2> Mayor Duerr got the sort of majority usu <l> ally enjoyed only by

dictators in one-party states: 90.4%, outshin <l> ing Ralph Klein's 90.1%

popularity in 1986.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#36:2> The 148,389 votes bestowed upon the bland, bespecta <l> cled urban

planner gave him a lead of 144,000 over his nearest rival, proving once and

for all that charisma is not neces <l> sary for political success, even for

an in <l> cumbent who has already pared 400 of 13,000 city jobs. </p> <O>

Age. </it> </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#37:2> Calgary's general contentment was al <l> most as evident in its

14 aldermanic races.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#38:2> Only one incumbent, Sharon Fisk in Ward 2, was ejected.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#39:2> The rookie alderman had never managed to live down having phoned the

Calgary fire department for a safe lift home after a New Year's Eve party.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#40:2> She lost heavily to Edgemont community association president Joanne

Kerr.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#41:2> The only other changes: contractor David Bronconnier and radio

horticulturalist Barry Erskine won in vacant Wards 6 and 11.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#42:2> The only other tight race was between Glen Johnston and chal <l>

lenger Ann Blough in Ward 13, the recount deciding in favour of the

incumbent.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#43:2> Yvonne Fritz of Ward 5 and Sue Higgins of Ward 12 won by acclamation.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#44:2> There was similar stability in the city's public school board

race, notwithstanding a teacher wage settlement last winter that was triple

the rate of inflation and has al <l> ready led to program cuts.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#45:2> The board will include new faces since four of its seven incumbents,

including past chairman Mar <l> garet Lounds, declined to run again.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#46:2> De <l> spite rising property taxes and soaring school fees,

conservative ex-chairman Harald Gunderson was unable to take the Ward 3-4

seat; it fell to newcomer Patti Grier.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#47:2> Frugal former trustee Scott Saville helped dump incumbent Ann Craig

from the Ward 12-14 trusteeship, but lost to Connie Rosenstein.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#48:2> Despite school safety worries arising from last spring's murder of

Ryan Garrioch, anti-violence crusader Roberta McDonald was unable to win

out-going chairman Margaret <w> Lounds' </w> Wards 6-7 seat; ex-trustee Dr.

Paul Adams returned after being benched three years.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#49:2> Likewise, anti-violence advocate Linda Cornell failed to take empty

Wards 1-2, losing to newcomer Jennifer Pollock.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#50:2> In short, public school voters had a chance to speak clearly on

violence and costs, and most did not. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#51:2> Despite much acrimonious debate, the Calgary Separate School

Board will see four familiar faces returning.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#52:2> The empty seat in Wards 13-14 went to newcomer Judy Look.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#53:2> The two incumbents unseated were chairman John Donnachie, the 12-year

veteran from Wards 3-4, and Wards 6-7-8 trustee Jocelyn Burgener.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#54:2> The Sepa <l> rate School Board had been criticized for the secrecy of

its budgetary process, and there was some suspicion that its incum <l> bents

would be turned out <indig> <it> en masse </it> </indig> .
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#55:2> Vot <l> ers, however, vented most of their spleen upon the chairman.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#56:2> He will be replaced in Wards 3-4 by retired teacher Colin Maclsaac.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#57:2> Jocelyn Burgener, who last spring accused Mr. Donnachie of preju <l>

dice against a woman applicant for the superintendent's job, also lost

narrowly to newcomer Lois Burke-Gaffney, wife of former trustee Frank

Burke-Gaffney.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#58:2> Hers, however, was one of three races suffi <l> ciently close to

require a recount.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#59:2> Like <l> wise, the close victories of incumbent Lynn L'Heureux in

Wards 9-10 and Linda Blasetti in Wards 1-2 were awaiting con <l> firmation

this week. </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#61:3> <h> <bold> AIDS activists plan to put on the heat </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#62:3> The long-awaited National AIDS strategy promised by Federal

Health Minister Perrin Beatty for the end of 1989 has been delayed again.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#63:3> According to Alastair Clay <l> ton, of the Federal Centre for AIDS,

such a strategy will not be ready until next summer.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#64:3> Other federal officials suggest that the strategy will not be ready

until the spring.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#65:3> And this is in the eighth year of the impact of the AIDS epidemic on

Ca <l> nadian society - eight years of criminal federal neglect of the needs

and concerns of people living with AIDS and HIV. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#66:3> A 56 page draft <quote> " working docu <l> ment for development

of a National Strategy on HIV infection and AIDS" </quote> was prepared by

Sadinsky and Associates ( who have no spe <l> cial expertise on AIDS / HIV)

for Health and Welfare Canada in October 1989.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#67:3> This working document was to provide the basis for consul <l> tation

between various state, pro <l> fessional and community-based groups and to

lead towards a na <l> tional strategy by the end of 1989. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#68:3> This document, the many flaws and limitations of which will be

mentioned below, is being held up according to Clayton because of the delay

in consultation with the prov <l> inces and with non-governmental

organizations.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#69:3> Apparently a num <l> ber of provinces have been slow in responding to

this document.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#70:3> The delay has angered the Canadian AIDS Society ( CAS - a coalition

of AIDS community groups) and oth <l> ers who fear that their core-funding

will be endangered if there is no National Strategy soon ( many can <l> not

wait another six months to find out if there basic funding will con <l> tinue

or not), and who want other positive AIDS action in the very near future.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#71:3> It appears that there may be sub <l> stantial differences within

the pro <l> vincial and federal AIDS and health bureaucracies over what

strategy to adopt in dealing with AIDS.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#72:3> Inter <l> estingly, the future of institutions like the Federal

Centre for AIDS was not even mentioned in the draft strategy document. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#73:3> Perrin Beatty promised commu <l> nity-based AIDS groups and AIDS

activists that he was going to be very different from his predecessor, Jake

Epp.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#74:3> He promised that he wanted to consult with AIDS groups and with

groups represent <l> ing people living with AIDS ( PLWAs) and with others to

finally develop a National AIDS Strategy.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#75:3> Some AIDS activists warned at the time that there were dangers in

fall <l> ing for such a period of " consulta <l> tion" if we did not visibly

keep up the political pressure on the federal government and health bur <l>

eaucracy.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#76:3> A lengthy process of dia <l> logue and consultation, it was feared,

could lead to a lessening of a pressure on the federal front for positive

AIDS action.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#77:3> What has happened is that most AIDS groups did opt for giving Beatty

some time for this process of consultation.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#78:3> As a result pressure for action has slipped on the federal level as

groups met with Sadinsky and his associates or with Beatty and as valuable

months have slipped by with no action being taken. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#79:3> Some had assumed that Alastair Clayton of the Federal Centre for

AIDS was on his way out.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#80:3> In his long term in office he has done vir <l> tually nothing to help

PLWAs re <l> garding treatment delivery con <l> cerns.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#81:3> Many have been surprised to see that he is still around and is being

quoted as a federal spokes <l> man on AIDS policy issues.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#82:3> There has been no positive federal action which has not been the

direct result of the initiatives of AIDS activists. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#83:3> Beatty has now been Health Minister for a year and aside from

putting forward a nice liberal smil <l> ing face he has done virtually noth

<l> ing for PLWAs / HIV.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#84:3> The recent an <l> nouncement of funding for haemophiliacs who have

acquired HIV infection through blood prod <l> ucts, a measure to assure

Canadians of the safety of the Canadian blood system, angered many AIDS activ

<l> ists and representatives of commu <l> nity-based AIDS groups since it

gave funding to only one group of PLWAS / HIV rather than all of them (

divide and conquer?) and because it seemed to play on the distinction between

" innocent" ( like haemo <l> philiacs) and " guilty" ( those who may have

developed HIV infection through sexual or drug-related ac <l> tivities) PLWAs

/ HIV. </p> <O> rest of article </O> </I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#87:4> New York - Although the elev <l> enth annual membership confer

<l> ence of the North American Man / Boy Love Association ( NAMBLA) was held

as planned November 11-12, the organization's plans to hold a poetry reading

with Allen Ginsberg in the Lesbian and Gay Community Centre was ve <l> toed

by a vote of the Centre's board of directors, which denied the use of the

facility to the group. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#88:4> Not only did the Centre's board refuse to give any reason for its

ac <l> tion, it also instructed the director to not even release a tally of

its vote on the issue. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#89:4> The board's decision raised con <l> cerns among the activists

about its power to block activities considered controversial.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#90:4> " The Community Centre is discriminating against a group that is part

of the gay com <l> munity.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#91:4> They should either let NAMBLA use the facility, or take <mention> 'community'

</mention> out of their name," said New York lawyer and AIDS activist Bill

Dobbs. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#92:4> NAMBLA, which describes it <l> self as " a political and

educational organization for men and boys in <l> terested in consensual

sexual and emotional relationships," charac <l> terized its exclusion as

<quote> " censor <l> ship." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#93:4> " We were told in September that space was available, but that

since the request was from NAMBLA, we would have to filter it through the

board of directors," said Chris Far <l> rell, a NAMBLA spokesperson.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-019#94:4> The board took six weeks to issue its decision. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-019#95:4> " In the wake of the Mapplethorpe controversy, I don't think that

gays and lesbians want to be told what kinds of homoerotic expression can be

shown in an art gallery or on safe-sex posters, let alone what poetry can be

read in our community centre," Farrell added </p> </I> .
