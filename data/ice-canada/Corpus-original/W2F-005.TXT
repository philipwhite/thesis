<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#2:1> Evelyn Lau

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-005#3:1> Each morning when the child psychiatrist wakes up, he goes into

the bathroom and talks to his reflection in the mirror.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#4:1> " You're an asshole," he says out loud, pausing for a moment before

twisting the tap and letting the water run down the drain in a cold white

column. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-005#5:1> The story of the child psychiatrist is a good place to start.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#6:1> His name had sounded familiar to me but even when I told you there was

a good possibility that I knew him, you went on with his secrets after only a

moment of consideration for the trust that had been placed in you.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#7:1> I kept picturing this man telling himself he was an asshole while

looking levelly at his reflection and I was certain we had at some point met,

crossed paths in the labyrinth of offices and mental health centres and

hospitals.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#8:1> Finally one evening I thumbed through some old journals and saw that

he had treated me once, very briefly, after a feeble suicide attempt during

which I had walked into the nearest hospital raising loud, coarse demands for

attention.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#9:1> Oh, I was never like one of the patients you favour, the one you

always visit before you visit me, condensing our faces and bodies into one

and emptying out your remaining lust for her into me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#10:1> I could never have been so brave as her, to push a shotgun under my

chin and pull the trig <l> ger.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#11:1> You love her for her suffering beauty, for the scar tissue gathered

just under her cheek-bone where the bullet erupted, veering off its path.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#12:1> I wish often that she had died, but then it would have been someone

else; there are so many wounded people to choose from.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#13:1> And then there is that woman doctor you fell in love with.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#14:1> This is the order, then: you visit the patient you love and cannot

touch, and then you bring your longing for her to me to discard, and then —

in trying to forget this — you visit the doctor who is now married and has a

newborn child.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#15:1> I wish I could have been like either of them, that brave or that

educated.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#16:1> I am neither.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#17:1> I remain caught in the middle gathering your confessions to me like

stones. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-005#18:1> " You don't understand," you tell me when I confront you with

these things.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#19:1> " Maybe one day when you're forty you'll understand, in here."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#20:1> Your hand depresses your chest, the flower-patterned tie.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#21:1> " You'll under <l> stand what loneliness is all about." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-005#22:1> It would be grand to have such a monopoly on loneliness, on any

emotion, but you do not.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#23:1> I look after you in a helpless fury as you walk away from me,

collecting briefcases and pocket watches and a triumph that colours your eyes

like trees on summer evenings when the fading light washes through the

leaves, clear and jade.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#24:1> A smile curves your lips in satisfaction.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#25:1> I know that feeling of power rising in your chest, filling up the

hole there.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#26:1> Watching you inside your suit, the flesh crumpled around your eyes, I

half expect you to say something clinical and depressing like, " I never

suspected your psychopathology ran so deep."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#27:1> Instead you say you want the best for me, you have never done

anything to hurt me, is it so terrible to be loved by you? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-005#28:1> No, it would not be so terrible if the capacity to love existed

within you.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#29:1> I watch you straighten your tie and your notes - you scribble on

paper printed with things like, " ORAP: Comfortable, effective control for

the compliant schizophrenic" - and I am suddenly standing helpless, two

little fists closed up beside my thighs.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#30:1> I stare at you and wish for a shotgun or the beauty and intelligence

of the family doctor who tears you away from me towards banquets and

massages, which you describe in detail, forcing me to hide my dismay and

jealousy in a sudden tightening of the lips and jaw in the same way I hide my

delight at your occasional dependency, tast <l> ing my power like some sweet

thick syrup. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-005#31:1> The child psychiatrist was on duty that night I walked in.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#32:1> I was mildly overdosed, demanding a bed and comfort.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#33:1> He was running through the ward, surrounded by nurses and clipboards,

coattails flapping.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#34:1> He stopped by to sit on the edge of my bed, as much for a moment of

rest as to look at me and take hidden notes.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#35:1> I remember he looked tired, that the flesh gathered darkly around his

eyes and his cheekbones.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#36:1> You say he is an attractive man, with the sort of appraising lust

that you display towards anyone you meet because the lust is an emptiness

that can't be filled by anything sexual.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#37:1> Yes, I remember there was an attractiveness to his exhaustion when he

sat on the stretched white sheets and we talked for a few minutes.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#38:1> I remember asking him to adopt me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#39:1> He smiled and refused in some gentle way.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#40:1> I remember rubbing a leg up against him through the sheets and the

blankets as he sat there, partially for reassur <l> ance, partially to try

and comfort him, to stroke a little of the weariness from his face.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#41:1> And then he was gone and I can only now imagine him the next morning,

telling himself as though he was another person, " You're an asshole," before

departing for his office and then later on his rounds at the hospital. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-005#42:1> There were other stories, like the one of the psychiatrist who

trained you in England.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#43:1> He was the only doctor who wasn't clenched and critical, who didn't

circle you aggressively, wielding notes on your progress.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#44:1> Instead he liked to leap back when he saw you, his eyes opened wide

in exaggerated surprise.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#45:1> He would clutch his chest or his forehead and shout, " Oh my God,

such brilliance, such brilliance!" at one thing or another that you did,

lightening the harsh walls and corridors and teach <l> ing you to laugh.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#46:1> He was plump and he always had a kind word, you say.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#47:1> While the other psychiatrists watched you grimly, he built you up the

way your father never did, he gave you moments of pleasure which you had to

hoard from the analytical eyes around you.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#48:1> It wasn't <w> 'til </w> years later that the <it> British Medical

Journal </it> dropped into your hands and the obituaries said no one had

glimpsed the depth of his depression, no one had suspected he would go and

commit suicide like that.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#49:1> You told me this after several drinks; I could tell by the way your

eyes steeled themselves against the story issuing from your lips that this

was unlike other hurts.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#50:1> You recalled how fat and kindly he was, unlike the other influential

figures in your life who ironically refuse to die — your father, for

instance, your other analysts who are almost twice your age.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#51:1> To me they seem as good as dead.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#52:1> I cannot picture anyone that old, but then I hear they are giving

lectures and marching off to foreign countries to attend eminent

psychoanalytic groups and I find an admiration washing over me like it does

over you, a helpless attraction to their wizened power.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#53:1> I think of that psychiatrist in England and how desperate he must

have been, surrounded by people like that, people like you.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#54:1> Perhaps he too grew to believe he had a monopoly on loneliness. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-005#55:1> Having so much power must be a terrible thing, an awful

temptation.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#56:1> You can barely contain yourself from telling me about your patients,

ask <l> ing for my opinion on one case or another, making me believe that I

could perform in greedy leaps and bounds what you took years and years to

learn.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#57:1> That I could mount a false degree on the wall and sit in a leather

armchair and deal with the tearful arguing couples and the seductive young

women in tight dresses and high heels whom you kiss therapeuti <l> cally on

the mouth and the young boys you eye secretly with a churning dark passion.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#58:1> You make me feel important and almost grotesquely bril <l> liant,

that if I took your hand you could lead me across all boundaries of morality

and integrity and we would be like two children, exempt from real

condemnation or punishment. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-005#59:1> " The only problem with you," you tell me often, looking at me

with a teasing amusement, " is that you are too much of a prude."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#60:1> I picture this as someone in sensible shoes and pearls and am shaken

by the image, I try to dance to your complicated tunes, I take your hand, I

try to follow. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-005#61:1> And so you begin to plan to bring me into your sessions, to pose

me as a psychiatric trainee with a clipboard in my lap and cool, supposedly

scrupulous eyes.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#62:1> I still think of how we broke into one of the mental health clinics

one evening, the one where the staff had recognized something wrong and fired

you, and how you took me gleefully from one office to the next.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#63:1> You rummaged through papers on desks and volumes of work by

Californian psychoanalysts on bookshelves, calling out the names and

descriptions of the social workers and counsellors you had worked with for

years.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#64:1> " Linda.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#65:1> God, she was such a cunt.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#66:1> One of those rav <l> ing feminists &dotted-line;."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#67:1> Your former office had been the largest of all.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#68:1> I entered each of these rooms with you, meek and delighted at the

same time, filled with both shame and passion.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#69:1> But despite this I was not you, the voyeur in me grew perturbed and

quiet as the tour went on, and when you grabbed for me while sitting on one

of the therapist's desks, kissing me, laughing with delight at this

transgression, I wanted to leave. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-005#70:1> I can pretend to be a victim here, to have been utterly misled by

you, to have been helpless.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#71:1> Or I can pretend to be a manipulative young woman who seduced you in

a crazy and clever way, who exposed your secrets and destroyed your

reputation.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#72:1> The dangerous thing is that we can look at our relationship from any

angle, and each of these angles will hold its own truth.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#73:1> The twisting is so subtle.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#74:1> I could present this story in any light with <l> out having to tell a

single lie. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-005#75:1> But there is no sense now in playing those games.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#76:1> I think that after everything, there is only the pathos, which holds

no special knowledge or glamour.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#77:1> How I used to thrill to your stories of some of the most eminent

doctors in our city, reduced to nothing but people — and rather appalling

people at that — like the psychiatrist who enjoyed masturbating dogs, or the

analysts who were being investigated for sexual abuse after they had done

undeniably excellent work with adolescents or borderline personal <l> ities

or schizophrenics. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-005#78:1> I think of the time I slashed my wrists after one of our fights

and you, who have seen so many slashed wrists in your time, could only

examine me briefly and competently, just enough to see I wasn't in danger of

dying, and then lie back to allow me to give you a blow job.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#79:1> I guess after a while we all look pretty much alike and you don't

want to know what pro <l> pelled me that day to look at myself in the mirror

while lines of blood ran down my arms and into the sink.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#80:1> When I painted my lips with a dab of the berry-coloured blood and

said very quietly, in the blue and silent air, " You're an asshole," to my

reflection in the mirror, which looked back without blinking, as though it

understood perfectly. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-005#81:1> I am sorry for the stories and for us, the unflinching

reflections which enable you and I, as soon as we have established that we

are abusers, to cut off the cold tap-water burbling down the drain and walk

out into the world in search of other victims. </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-005#82:2> Velma thinks about her hands.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#83:2> They will be pale <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> delicate <}> <-> &

</-> <+> and </+> </}> creamy. </I> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#X84:2> She will fold them in her lap.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#X85:2> She'll clap them lightly together at a violin recitals.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#X86:2> Her nails will be tapered with an emery stick.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-005#X87:2> On her dressing table there'll be different shades of polish to go

with her different clothes. </p> </X>
