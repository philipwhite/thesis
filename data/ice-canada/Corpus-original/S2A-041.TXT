<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#1:1> If there was a problem before and if anything had been done
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#2:1> And <}> <-> there are </-> <=> there is </=> </}> social services you

know <.> th </.>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#3:1> But you could not approach them yourself <,> that would have to go

through the school
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#4:1> And through nursing possibly I mean if it's really bad nursing knows

as well
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#5:1> <}> <-> There's </-> <=> There's </=> </}> a nursing station in every

<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#6:1> They're great I'll never have such great <unclear> word </unclear>

service again <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#7:1> Uhm but sometimes things do happen <}> <=> that're </=> <-> are </->

</}> <,> upsetting because you do become involved in these uh communities and

you know the children and you know the parents and you know what's going on

and uhm
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#8:1> It has an upside in that <}> <-> you </-> <=> you </=> </}> can become

really involved if you've got a child who's got a learning disability or

something
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#9:1> The parents can be very <unclear> word </unclear> it's not hard to

find them and it's not hard to contact them and they're usually very very <,>

interested in trying to find a way to help their child
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#10:1> Obviously uhm
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#11:1> And so in that way it can be really rewarding when you've got a

situation where you're really working with the parents to help this child and

you can do that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#12:1> It's not just you know you have a hundred and twenty students you're

an E S L specialist and oh that's that kid third row in the back you know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#13:1> You know where their parents are living come from what they do after

school
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#14:1> You know these <unclear> word </unclear> you see them they see you

after school and you know exactly what's happening
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#15:1> So <O> sniff </O> on one hand it's a lot of fun and <}> <-> and it

</-> <=> you </=> </}> can really get in personal contact with the community

but on the other hand it can be <}> <-> if there's </-> <=> if something </=>

</}> bad happens it can go very wrong
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#16:1> And I mean there was a <}> <-> <.> stats </.> uhh </-> <=> another

</=> </}> thing that came out in the newspaper fairly recently <,> I think

just after Christmas on <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> suicide rate in

</=> </}> in Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#18:1> And now <,> in the three years I was there I was lucky in that there

was only one suicide in one of the communities I was in and it was a <{> <[>

<unclear> three or four words </unclear> </[> student

<$ZL> <ICE-CAN:S2A-041#19:1:Z> <[> <O> loud cough in audience </O> </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#20:1:Z> Uhm but I mean when something like that happens it's just <,>

really really really really horrendous
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#21:1:Z> There's nothing <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#22:1:Z> You're just totally numb through the core <}> <-> and </-> <=> and

</=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#23:1:Z> I mean that's to say it knocks the whole community out of the water

as well and <O> sniff </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#24:1:Z> There's nothing to say that that will happen but <}> <-> it's </->

<=> it is </=> </}> a possibility
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#25:1:Z> It does happen

<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#27:1:Z> Especially if it's one of your students <,,> <&> About 8 seconds of

quiet muttering and loud noises </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-041#28:1:A> It's just a horrible thing

that <unclear> four words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#30:1:A> What do we do
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#31:1:A> Where do they go
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#32:1:A> There's only <,> so much that they can do <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#33:1:A> School is one of the only things that they have to do and lord

knows <O> laugh </O> that's not always a lot of fun to them

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-041#38:1:A> Fairly seldom <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#39:1:A> Uhm <,> very seldom actually
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#40:1:A> Usually teachers will stay in one place <}> <-> for </-> <=> for

</=> </}> a length of time <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#41:1:A> Uhm sometimes it depends like two of my friends who came up when we

</-> <=> to cover for </=> </}> a maternity leave
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#42:1:A> Well when that person came back <,> that job wasn't there anymore

request </=> </}> a transfer if you want to
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#46:1:A> If you feel you want to try out

</unclear> working in a small place or vice versa
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#48:1:A> If you get there
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#49:1:A> But it doesn't happen all that often

teach in a school <unclear> three words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#51:1:A> And it gets easily fifteen if not <,> seventeen years
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#52:1:A> Easily that long
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#53:1:A> And she's been in a number of communities because after three or

four years in the same community you <}> <-> kinda </-> <+> kind of </+> </}>

feel like you want a change
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#54:1:A> But she still wants to stay at the <unclear> word </unclear> so

she's <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> <}> <-> hafta </-> <+> have

to </+> </}> <unclear> four words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#55:1:A> But I think she's the only person I know that has <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#56:1:A> The <unclear> word </unclear> can travel to most places but <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#57:1:A> You will get to travel <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#58:1:A> You get to travel but <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#59:1:A> Every two years we have <unclear> word </unclear> days in Kuujuak

</unclear> do the whole coast <O> laugh ends </O> all the way around which is

well it's twelve villages by the time you get up
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#62:1:A> <O> laugh starts </O> <unclear> word </unclear> You'll be glad to

<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#63:1:A> At least from there
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#64:1:A> Sometimes the things that happen <,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-041#66:1:A> Yeah I think it <}> <-> probly </-> <+> probably </+> </}> is

harder cos I went up with <@> Marcus </@> so <}> <-> for me it <.> wasn </.>

</-> <=> I didn't have </=> </}> that problem <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#67:1:A> Uhm <,>

<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#137:1:A> Oh uhh well I'll let you look at it later because

<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#145:1:A> We have our own printing <,> facilities and we produce all of

<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#146:1:A> Uhm <,> and <}> <-> we have some really I </-> <=> I brought some

<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#147:1:A> I have no idea <O> start laugh </O> what this book is about guys

<O> end laugh </O> so don't ask me what it's about but it's really pretty

<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#152:1:A> Now this I can just guess it's about this little girl <,> you know

<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#155:1:A> <}> <-> So </-> <=> So </=> </}> there are things there but just

sometimes they're not as much as you need
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#156:1:A> Or when you get to your class and
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#157:1:A> Like my first year I had grade five six seven split
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#158:1:A> I had one kid who was grade five three <,> three two
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#159:1:A> Two grade sixes and ten grade sevens
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#160:1:A> I think that's how it worked
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#161:1:A> Yeah because like thirteen and then seven eight nine great
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#162:1:A> But I discovered very quickly those grade sevens <}> <-> could

</-> <=> couldn't </=> </}> even do the grade six math book
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#163:1:A> So I had to suddenly launch them back into grade five math
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#164:1:A> Which was a bit of a trauma for them of course but
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#165:1:A> <}> <-> Not not </-> <=> Not </=> </}> as much of a trauma as it

was for me to realize that aaahh they're not at the level they're <}> <->

sposed </-> <+> supposed </+> </}> to be
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#166:1:A> What am I <}> <-> sposed </-> <+> supposed </+> </}> to do here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#167:1:A> So <}> <-> you <.> c </.> </-> <=> I couldn't </=> </}> follow

absolutely everything that was in the grade five math book cos I didn't want

them to feel like babies
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#168:1:A> And so I was <}> <-> makin </-> <+> making </+> </}> math sheets

<$ZS> <ICE-CAN:S2A-041#169:1:Z> <O> audience member comments </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-041#170:1:A> <unclear> word </unclear> Machines
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#171:1:A> You know TESL people are the only people I've found in the north

that know how to work a <unclear> word </unclear> machine
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#172:1:A> Cos most of their programs don't seem to even entertain the

thought that you might find one anywhere
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#173:1:A> We still have those in the north and they work wonderfully
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#174:1:A> Just covered in purple ink and <,> yeah yeah
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#175:1:A> So I made <,> <}> <-> a hundred and </-> <=> a thousand and </=>

</}> one math sheets
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#176:1:A> I can't think of
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#177:1:A> The math sheets I have been making for so long I don't ever <}>

<-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> see them again
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#178:1:A> So this is it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#179:1:A> You've got stuff there you've got the bones <,> generally but <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#180:1:A> And especially if it's something you don't know a lot about like

<,> you know science class was not my idea of a grand time
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#181:1:A> Cos a lot of the time I just couldn't figure out what it was they

were aiming us at
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#182:1:A> And there're a <}> <-> lotta </-> <+> lot of </+> </}> <.> tho

</.>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#183:1:A> Everything's very hands on uhm specially the math program
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#184:1:A> The math program has
<ICE-CAN:S2A-041#185:1:A> There's <}> <-> a room in every school </-> <=> a small room in

every school </=> </}> for the math supplies </I>
