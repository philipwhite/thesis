<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#1:1> By January of 1945 the government of the United States arrived at

the decision to conduct international trials, re <l> ferring to the war

crimes and that were committed by the Ger <l> mans during the second world

war.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#2:1> The three other Allied powers, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and

France accepted the decision by the Americans.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#3:1> These trials came to be known as the Nuremberg Trials, which opened on

November 20, 1945.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#4:1> A re <l> presentative from each of the Allied countries signed an

Agree <l> ment of seven articles which made up the International Military

Tribunal. <fnr> 1 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#5:1> The trial was conducted in four languages simultaneously, and every

seat in the court had a pair of headphones at <l> tached to it in which the

trial could be heard in English, Russian, French or German. <fnr> 2 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#6:1> The defendants who were brought to court were those whose crimes fell

within three categories: crimes against peace; war crimes; and crimes against

humanity. <fnr> 3 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#7:1> Twenty-two defendants were indicted, the court con <l> ducted 403 open

sessions, throughout the trial 113 witnesses were called, and one hundred

thousand documents were accepted by the court. <fnr> 4 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#8:1> At Nuremberg, seven organizations were declared criminal: the

Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party; the SS, an elite corps under Himmler; the

SD, a Security Service; the SA, a paramilitary organization; the Gestapo, the

secret state police; the Reich Cabinet, and the General Staff and High Com

<l> mand of the German Armed Forces. <fnr> 5 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#9:1> The trials at Nuremberg ar <l> oused many different feelings, but it

was felt that the German people and organizations responsible for

enslavement, genocide, initiating war, and other atrocities should be brought

to justice. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#10:1> The War Crimes committed by the Germans were not spon <l> taneous

events, some were planned at the highest level and carefully thought out in

advance.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#11:1> Article 6 ( b) of the Charter defines war crimes in these words:

<quote> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#X12:1> " War Crimes: namely, violations of the laws or customs of war.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#X13:1> Such violations shall include, but not be limited to, murder,

ill-treatment or deportation to slave labor or for any other purpose of

civilian population of or in occupied territory, murder or ill-treatment of

prisoners of war or persons on the seas, killing of hostages, plunder of

public or private property, wan <l> ton destruction of cities, towns, or

villages, or deva <l> station not justified by military necessity. </X>

</quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#14:1> During the Second World War the treatment towards the prisoners

of war by the Germans was harsh and cruel.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#15:1> Allied soldiers who had surrendered to the Germans were shot immedi

<l> ately, commando troops were also killed on the spot, and those who were

executed in concentration camps at a later date were obviously never given a

trial of any sort. <fnr> 7 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#16:1> The treatment to <l> wards Soviet prisoners of war was particularly

inhumane.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#17:1> They were left without proper clothing; the wounded were given no

medical care; they were starved, and many were simply left to die. <fnr> 8

</fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#18:1> Soviet prisoners in some cases were branded with a special permanent

mark, and were also used for medical experiments. <fnr> 9 </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#19:1> The use of concentration camps was widespread during the war.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#20:1> The concentration camps were places where people were subject to

brutality.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#21:1> For those who did not die during the trip to the camps were given

hard physical labor, inade <l> quate food, clothes, and shelter.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#22:1> Some concentration camps were equipped with gas chambers, for the

purpose of destroying the inmates and furnaces for burning the dead bodies.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#23:1> Some of the these were used for the extermination of Jews as a part

of the " final solution" to the Jewish problem. <fnr> 10 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#24:1> There were plans to get rid of whole native populations in Poland and

the Soviet Union, and Hitler wrote in " Mein Kampf": <quote> " It is not our

task to Germanize the east in the old sense, that is to teach the people

there the German language and the German law, but to see to it that only

people of purely Germanic blood live in the east." </quote> </p> <fnr> 11

</fnr>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#25:1> Private property in many occupied countries was invaded upon in

which private collections and libraries were robbed, and private houses were

seized. <fnr> 12 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#26:1> Another crime included the slave-labor programme, where at least five

million men and women were taken from their homes and sent to work in German

factories or on farms. <fnr> 13 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#27:1> The camps in which they were placed were unsanitary, the food was

scarce, and even a portion of their pay was taken. <fnr> 14 </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#28:1> The liquidation of the Jews from German life was a policy that

had been established by the Germans by 1938.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#29:1> The Jews were originally forced to live in ghettoes, to wear a yellow

star on the breast and back, and were used as slave laborers.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#30:1> But the plans for the " final solution" of the Jewish question meant

the extermination of all Jews. <fnr> 15 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#31:1> As a part of the " final solution" all Jews from German occupied

Europe were placed in concentra <l> tion camps.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#32:1> All who were fit to work were used as slave lab <l> orers, and those

who were not fit to work were killed in gas chambers and then their bodies

were burnt.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#33:1> The Jews as well as the Soviets were used in medical experiments such

as deter <l> mining how long human beings could survive in freezing water.

<fnr> 16 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#34:1> It has been estimated that this policy resulted in the killing of six

million Jews. <fnr> 17 </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#35:1> Crimes against Humanity often overlapped War Crimes, and Article

6 of the Charter states: <X> <quote> " Crimes against humanity: namely,

murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts com

<l> mitted against any civilian population, before or dur <l> ing the war; or

persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in

connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or

not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated." </X>

</quote> <fnr> 18 </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#36:1> The persecution of the Jews, and murdering civilians who were

thought to hold opposing views against the German govern <l> ment, were

crimes carried out on a vast scale and were consid <l> ered crimes against

humanity.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#37:1> Crimes against humanity were committed as a result of racial or

religious persecutions. <fnr> 19 </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#38:1> The Chief Prosecutors of the Nuremberg Trials decided on

twenty-four individuals who were thought to be the most guilty of the

surviving leaders. <fnr> 20 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#39:1> But only twenty-two of these men were actually tried because one

committed suicide in prison and one was too ill to stand his trial.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#40:1> Each of the defendants was represented by one or more German counsel.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#41:1> And when it was time to deal with the evidence against the

defendants, it was to be remembered that no man could be punished for an act

unless both the act and its penalty had been defined in writing before the

date of the act. <fnr> 21 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#42:1> To give an idea of what the accused in <l> dividuals were involved

with, I will talk about four men, name <l> ly Goering, Hess, Von Ribbentrop

and Keitel. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#43:1> Goering, after Hitler, was the most potent man in the Nazi

regime.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#44:1> He was the advisor, the active agent of Hitler, and one of the main

leaders of the Nazi movement.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#45:1> Not only did he establish the Gestapo, he created the first concentra

<l> tion camps. <fnr> 22 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#46:1> Besides Hitler, he was the moving force for ag <l> gressive war, and

was deeply involved in the planning and man <l> euvering the military in

preparation for war.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#47:1> Goering admitted to the accusations stated against him above,

including leading the slave-labor program and persecuting the Jews.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#48:1> With all of the evidence piled against him he was found guilty on all

four counts of the indictment, and was sentenced to death by hang <l> ing.

<fnr> 23 </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#49:1> <w> Hess' </w> position as Deputy to the Fuehrer included being

the top man in the Nazi Party with the responsibility for hand <l> ling all

party matters. <fnr> 24 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#50:1> He was an active supporter of prepa <l> rations for war, and he

blamed England and France for the war.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#51:1> Hess was a willing participant in German aggression against Austria,

Czechoslovakia, and Poland.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#52:1> When the trials were underway there was some discrepancy about

whether he was men <l> tally stable enough to stand trial and defend himself,

and due to this factor he was represented by counsel, and was found guilty on

counts one and two, and was sentenced to life in prison. <fnr> 25 </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#53:1> In 1932 Von Ribbentrop joined the Nazi Party, and by 1933 he was

Foreign Policy Adviser to Hitler. <fnr> 26 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#54:1> Von Ribbentrop was involved in areas such as participating in the

plans to attack Czechoslovakia, he played an important role in the act <l>

ivities which led up to the attack on Poland, and he urged Japan to invade

the Soviet Union. <fnr> 27 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#55:1> He is responsible for war crimes against humanity due to his

involvement in the extermination of Jews.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#56:1> The Tribunal found Von Ribbentrop guilty on all four counts and was

sentenced to death. <fnr> 28 </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#57:1> On the day that Hitler took control of the armed forces he made

Keitel Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#58:1> His war crimes included activities such as ordering that for every

German soldier that was killed, fifty to a hundred Com <l> munists should be

put to death. <fnr> 29 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#59:1> He felt that civilians sus <l> pected of any violations against

German troops should be shot without trial, and that no trials were necessary

for the German violations against the civilians.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#60:1> In short, he ordered that his troops use terrorism. <fnr> 30 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#61:1> Keitel admitted to these acts and was found guilty on all four

counts, and like Von Ribbentrop and Goering, was sentenced to death. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#62:1> Not only were certain individuals brought to trial, but

organizations who had committed crimes were brought forward as well.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#63:1> Therefore, a person who was a member of an organiza <l> tion which

was declared to be criminal was liable to be con <l> victed of the crime of

membership and be punished. <fnr> 31 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#64:1> But, all members of an organization who left there positions before

September first, 1939 were not liable to be charged with any criminal acts.

<fnr> 32 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#65:1> It was suspected that more than half a million people were involved

in the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party alone, each of who played a key

part in the Nazi party. <fnr> 33 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#66:1> The seven organizations that were declared criminal were: The Lead

<l> ership Corps of the Nazi Party; the Gestapo; the S.D.; the S.S.; the

S.A.; the Reich Cabinet, and the General Staff and High Command of the German

Armed Forces. <fnr> 34 </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#67:1> The Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party was headed by Hitler as

Fuehrer, but the Party was actually run by Hess, the Chief of the Party

Chancellery. <fnr> 35 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#68:1> Its primary purpose was to help the Nazis obtain and keep control of

the German state. <fnr> 36 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#69:1> It was also used for criminal acts such as the persecution of the

Jews, the management of the slave labor program, and the mistreatment of the

prisoners of war. <fnr> 37 </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#70:1> The Gestapo and the S.D were prosecuted together be <l> cause

they worked so closely together. <fnr> 38 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#71:1> The S.D was used as an intelligence agency, and the Gestapo was made

up of various police forces which were under the leadership of Himmler and

Goering. <fnr> 39 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#72:1> The security police and the S.D. were voluntary or <l> ganizations,

but one was unable to pick their choice of assign <l> ments or positions.

<fnr> 40 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#73:1> They were used for such activities as per <l> secution and

extermination of Jews, killings in concentration camps and prisoners of war,

and involvement in the slave labor program. <fnr> 41 </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#74:1> The S.S. was originally established by Hitler in 1925, and by the

time the Nazis had gained power it was used to maintain order and control

audiences at demonstrations. <fnr> 42 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#75:1> By 1939, the S.S. had grown to membership of 240 000 men, and

possessed a legal office and its own legal systems. <fnr> 43 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#76:1> This or <l> ganization was prosecuted for the extermination of the

Jews, mistreatment of the civilian population, managing concentra <l> tion

camps, their involvement in the slave labor program and the ill-treatment of

prisoners of war. <fnr> 44 </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#77:1> The S.A was founded in 1921 for political purposes, and until

1939 its membership was completely voluntary. <fnr> 45 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#78:1> Until 1934 the S.A. was a group made up of combatants who were in <l>

volved in the Nazi outrages during that time. <fnr> 46 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#79:1> But it was not proved that this organization was part of the plan to

engage in aggressive war, and the Tribunal was unable to charge them with any

criminal acts under the Charter. <fnr> 47 </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-005#80:1> The Tribunal did not declare the Reich Cabinet with criminal

charges for two reasons: 1) it was not proved that af <l> ter 1937 it acted

as an organization; 2) there were too few peo <l> ple that were liable to be

charged. <fnr> 48 </fnr> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#X81:1> It was known that a num <l> ber of individuals were involved in the

strategy of aggressive war, but it could not be proven that they worked in a

group. <fnr> 49 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#X82:1> The General Staff and the High Command was dealt with in the same

manner as the Reich cabinet.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-005#X83:1> The number of persons charged here was greater, but still so small

that it would be more effective to give each one of them a separate trial.

<fnr> 50 </fnr> </X> </p> </I>
