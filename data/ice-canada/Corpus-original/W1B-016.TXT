<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#1:1> Congratulations on being made Acting Head of English ( whether you

like it or not!) </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#2:1> I am sorry my visit to <@> Jackson </@> ended before your return,

because I would liked to discuss the future of the <@> Language </@> Unit

with you.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#3:1> I did have several discussions with <@> Paul Taber </@> and <@> Ian

Johnson </@> about it.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#4:1> The consensus is that <@> Pam Campbell </@> 's contract should be

renewed for another year.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#5:1> We also scheduled to hand over the <}> <-> <.> ms </.> </-> <=>

manuscript </=> </}> of the <@> omnibus </@> to Oxford at the end of

December, but obviously there will be proof reading, consultations with the

copy editor and other <@> omnibus </@> - related matters to oversee after

that.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#6:1> Further, the Unit is involved in several other projects that need

someone on the spot. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#7:1> I have written <@> Ian </@> at length about how the Unit might

operate after the <@> omnibus </@> is out.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#8:1> I expect he will be in touch with you about it.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#9:1> Needless to say, there is no simple solution. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#10:1> I will be in Ottawa for a <@> BLC </@> prize jury meeting on

September 9-10 and might manage a flying visit to meet with <@> Pam </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#11:1> I could also see you then, if it works out.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#12:1> My e-mail address is <O> address </O> if you use e-mail - -
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#13:1> hope you had a restful time at the Castle. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#14:1> <@> jane Leap </@> </p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#15:2> <h> Dear <@> Sarah </@> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#16:2> The <@> Language </@> Unit's Advisory Committee meeting will be

held on Friday May 8th at 9:30.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#17:2> Enclosed is the agenda for the morning meeting, which will be chaired

by <@> Jack Hordan </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#18:2> I also enclose the minutes from last year's meeting; any changes or

additions to these can be considered at this year's meeting.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#19:2> After lunch, we will meet again to discuss entries, publication plans

and so forth more informally.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#20:2> This meeting will finish at five.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#21:2> At this point, your commitment to the Unit will be over, if you wish

to leave town!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#22:2> However, I hope that all of us can dine together Friday night.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#23:2> Rooms have been booked for you for Thursday, Friday and Saturday

nights at the <@> Wakawaka </@> Inn.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#24:2> Please let us know if you do not require the room for all of these

nights. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#25:2> I enclose a batch of entries for your perusal.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#26:2> Just write any rude remarks on the entries and mail them back (

include a receipt for the postage or bring it to the meeting and we will add

it to your expenses for reimbursement).
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#27:2> If you like, you can bring them with you to the meeting.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#28:2> A second batch which I hope to send soon will contain a larger

proportion of " grammatical" and long entries.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#29:2> Note the style guide; occasionally the entry may not conform to this

style, but we do plan to make it conform eventually.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#30:2> Please comment on whatever strikes you, including the style guide

itself, the number and suitability of the quotations, the tone, you be the

judge.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#31:2> Suggestions for new entries are always welcome.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#32:2> Every time I look at an entry, I see mistakes and want to rewrite the

whole thing.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#33:2> I am trying to postpone the perfectionism until later. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#34:2> You will notice that we have not followed the Advisory

Committee's suggestion that the book might be sectioned into Grammar,

Lexicon, <}> <-> <.> etc </.> </-> <=> et cetera </=> </}> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#35:2> We did consider the idea seriously, since <@> Earl Reinhardt </@> 's

<@> omnibus </@> is so structured, and this structure is logical and leads to

definite economies of space.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#36:2> Several arguments pushed us to the decision to go, generally, for

small entries rather than large, and to an alphabetic format rather than a

sectioned one.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#37:2> 1. Tradition: most <@> omnibuses </@> are structured alphabetically
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#38:2> 2. Readership: many readers would not be able to decide quickly which

section the problem they were tackling would be solved in
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#39:2> 3. Implications: <@> omnibuses </@> , by their very nature, are not

comprehensive, even or rational in their coverage.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#40:2> In usage, as in other fashions, there is a substratum of old

favourites and a thick layer of shifting trends.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#41:2> If we try to organize it logically we will simply make the inevitable

contradictions obvious to the user/reviewer.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#42:2> I do plan to deal with this in the introduction.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#43:2> 4. Ease of production: given the way the Unit operates, it is easier

to do short entries and later consider how they might be linked, either by a

general entry or by cross references or both, than to try to plan out the

larger entries in advance
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#44:2> 5. Ease of revision, abridgement, <}> <-> <.> etc </.> </-> <=> et

cetera </=> </}> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#45:2> It is also easier to cut and revise <@> an omnibus </@> that is

organized by short entries rather than long articles. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#46:2> 6. Reader / Browser appeal: we all agreed that it seems far less

daunting to see a series of little entries and that readers would be far more

<}> <-> enclined </-> <+> inclined </+> </}> to read a guide in bits than a

guide with headings like Grammar ( try to think back to a time when such a

heading filled you with <foreign> ennui </foreign> , if there ever was one!)

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#47:2> I hope these arguments don't seem too self-serving or

materialistic, but a <@> omnibus </@> is a curious amalgam of popular and

scholarly.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#48:2> It is pretty foolish to write a <@> omnibus </@> aimed at pleasing

scholars ( who presumably don't need one) that will repel precisely the group

which needs it, primarily university students.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#49:2> We do hope to have an index that will allow people to follow a theme

through the guide. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#50:2> I look forward to seeing you in May.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#51:2> Could you please book your flight, if you have not already done so,

so as to get the excursion fare?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#52:2> If you book train tickets more than five days in advance, you can

save 40% for some or all of the trip.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#53:2> I'm looking forward to seeing you. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#54:2> Best, <@> Margaret Lean </@> </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#55:3> Dear <@> Sarah </@> - - Well the only good news is that <@> Jerry

</@> got his package safely.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#56:3> Here is a repeat performance.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#57:3> The above is the letter that <@> Jerry </@> and <@> Tom </@> got.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#58:3> I wanted to tell you about the progress of the <@> SYLV </@> project.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#59:3> I have edited everything, it has gone back to everyone; however, I

have heard back so far only from <@> Lara Roberts </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#60:3> <@> Garret </@> wanted me to ask you some questions about flapping

<&> linguistic terminology </&> relative to the <@> Munro </@> paper, but I

will save it until I see you. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#61:3> I also enclose a copy of the plan a possible method for us to

generate a word frequency list.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#62:3> Do you have any suggestions?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#63:3> Again, we can talk it over when you are here. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#64:3> Cheers, <@> Margaret </@> </p> </I>


<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#65:4> Dear <@> Dorothy </@> , </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#66:4> It was great to hear your voice again!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#67:4> I hope we'll be able to have lunch together soon.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#68:4> Toronto's on my early May agenda. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#69:4> Here's a sketchy description or the project.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#70:4> We have a contract to deliver a machine-readable, tagged manuscript

to Oxford in September 1992.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#71:4> Titled the <@> Canadian English Omnibus </@> , it will contain 2,500

entries and run to <}> <-> + </-> <+> over </+> </}> 500 pages.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#72:4> It will be Canadian in 3 respects: our generalizations are based on a

large ( 8 million words) database of Canadian books, magazines, journals and

newspapers covering a range of subjects and aimed at a variety of audiences -

- specialist to popular.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#73:4> We also have a full year of the Globe ( 1985) and access to an

on-line database. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#74:4> We will give advice, but tempered by what we know about what

Canadians actually do.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#75:4> Thus although we will tell readers the rule about the possessive

before the gerund, we will also tell them that it is a dying practice.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#76:4> I enclose a few sample entries to give you an idea. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#77:4> I would like to ask you to help on 4 issues - -
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#78:4> 1. add to our list of Canadian practices <}> <-> <.> etc </.> </->

<=> et cetera </=> </}> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#79:4> We do not include all Canadianisms since we are not a dictionary.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#80:4> However, we do include Canadian words where there might be a usage

problem and where current American and British collegiate dictionaries are

unlikely to include the information.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#81:4> I enclose a list of examples.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#82:4> 2. possibly write the entry on the comma ( ? ! )
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#83:4> My view here is that since punctuation is so conventional, logic and

consistency should dictate as much as practice.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#84:4> We would, or course, try to discover what practice is - - however

it's not all that easy to search grammatical constructions on our database.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#85:4> 3. Once I've extracted all the format/style information I can from

Oxford, to comment briefly on same.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#86:4> 4. copyedit - - my idea is that we would send you large batches of

hard copy starting in March 1992 ( with perhaps a preliminary run, just to

see what's happening).
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#87:4> I'm trying to keep things consistent here but it's complex with 4

people writing entries.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#88:4> If you think editing tagged machine-readable copy would be easier,

let me know, but I think at the finai stage hard copy is best.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#89:4> We have an excellent typist here. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#90:4> I'd like an idea of your rates, standard contract <}> <-> <.>

etc. </.> </-> <=> et cetera </=> </}> before May and then maybe we can firm

things up when we lunch. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#91:4> Cheers, <@> Cherie Lee </@> </p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#92:5> <h> Dear <@> Chester </@> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#93:5> I'm sorry that our visits to <@> Royal </@> didn't overlap.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#94:5> How does it feel to take on such an awesome responsibility?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#95:5> I would have liked to talk to you and <@> Jack </@> about the Unit,

but it was not to be.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#96:5> Although <@> Jack </@> has agreed that <@> Pam </@> 's appointment

should be renewed for a year, he sensibly refuses to get involved in the

future of the <@> Language </@> Unit at this point in his Headship.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#97:5> So I think that your opinion is required about discussions I am

having with Oxford, since the Department is a signatory to the contract for

the usage guide. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#98:5> I went to <@> TUP </@> <&> Timbuktoo University Press </&> Canada

on my way here and talked to the new Managing Director, <@> Lillian Dowd </@>

, and <@> Katlyn Dresser </@> , the editor of the forthcoming <@> Canadian

Timbuktoo Dictionary </@> , about the <@> omnibus </@> , and we agreed to

change the contract in two ways.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#99:5> We agreed on a new deadline ( necessary because the first one was a

sheer guess and my recent past has prevented me from doing much work on

entries) and decided that <@> Pam </@> 's involvement in the intellectual

labour of the project should be recognized.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#100:5> If you look at my letter to <@> Lillian Dowd </@> , you will see

that I raised a few other issues with her after discussing the contract with

<@> Pam </@> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#101:5> The issue that directly concerns you is the way the royalties

are apportioned.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#102:5> I don't want to go into a blow-by-blow account of the discussions

between <@> Jack </@> and me over this, but it is the one occasion I can

remember where we disagreed seriously.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#103:5> Admittedly, at the time, the <@> Language </@> Unit budget was

extremely healthy, but when I suggested that the royalties be split between

me and the Unit he argued firmly that these should go to the Department

instead.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#104:5> One of his points was that this is the arrangement that the

Department has with <@> Calum Holland </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#105:5> However, the Department is effectively the publisher of <ul> <@>

Essay Skills </@> </ul> - - I think this weakens the analogy.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#106:5> Another point was that the <@> omnibus </@> has benefitted from the

work of members of the Department - - the Head, for example, has to spend

quite a lot of unrewarded time on <@> Language </@> matters.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#107:5> His main point was that the Department suffered from the loss of the

Director's teaching time.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#108:5> It did not seem to matter to him that the <@> Language </@> Unit

pays the Department for release time, nor that I did <ul> at least </ul> my

share of committee work and taught one course a year for five years, even

though if the one-third rule had been applied to the 2.5 load, I would have

been given a half course off every three years.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#109:5> I am pointing all this out in hopes that you will see at once that

the Department should consent to giving up a small portion of its royalties,

as will I, so that <@> Pam </@> 's contribution can be recognized.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#110:5> She has definitely crossed the line from employee to colleague as

far as I'm concerned, and I think this has to be recognized in the usual

ways. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-016#111:5> We worked out the proportions at the end of the contract with

the main 12 and 1/2 <}> <-> % </-> <+> percent </+> </}> royalty in mind:

thus, roughly, 5 <}> <-> % </-> <+> percent </+> </}> to me, 5 <}> <-> % </->

<+> percent </+> </}> to the Department and 2 <}> <-> % </-> <+> percent </+>

</}> to <@> Pam </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-016#112:5> <@> Timbuktoo </@> really doesn't care how we divvy up the

royalties, so if you have a different suggestion, we could certainly discuss

it. </p> </I>
