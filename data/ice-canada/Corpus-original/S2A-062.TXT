<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-062#1:1:A> <@> Raoul Eto </@> said he has no idea what happened at that

coat check area <,,> and this is an area where <,> someone punched him <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#2:1:A> Someone <?> actually </?> punched him and he doesn't remember <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#3:1:A> <@> Charles </@> says he went up to <?> ask </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#4:1:A> He got hit in the head and he got escorted out <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#5:1:A> <@> Glen Hawker </@> said he went up to talk to <@> Mick </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#6:1:A> He got pushed up against the wall and punched but he can't say what

happened next <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#7:1:A> And <@> Ron Lister </@> said he sees <@> Mick </@> grab <@> Glen

</@> <,> but he is in a choke hold
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#8:1:A> Despite this <,> he still sees what happens to <@> Glen </@> <,> but

he doesn't see anything else
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#9:1:A> He doesn't see what happened to <@> Raoul Eto </@> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#10:1:A> <@> Colleen </@> doesn't remember anything
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#11:1:A> <@> Mike </@> didn't see anything <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#12:1:A> <@> Don Craw </@> didn't <?> see anything </?> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#13:1:A> And <@> Dawn Kramer </@> and <@> Wanda Wisha </@> well <,> they

don't really <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#14:1:A> They didn't get up <unclear> maybe three words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#15:1:A> What I suggest to you is what they saw is what I already explained

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#16:1:A> They did see something going on there with Mister <@> Millner </@>

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#17:1:A> Mister <@> Avalon </@> says he came out of the office albeit the

skirmish was already well under way and he testifies to what he saw albeit he

is not a hundred percent positive of who he saw <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#18:1:A> Because if you'll recall <,> he couldn't say that <@> Mick Millner

</@> was down on the floor with <@> Raoul Eto </@> but <@> Mick </@> by his

own admission <?> said that </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#19:1:A> And <,> <unclear> word </unclear> you <?> saw </?> Mister <@> Raoul

Eto </@> a fairly large man <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#20:1:A> What I can't understand or what confuses me here <?> is how </?>

none of these people could see what was going on there right in front of them

right there on the floor in the coat check area
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#21:1:A> All of these people <@> Charles </@> <@> Glen </@> <@> Ronald </@>

<unclear> word </unclear> they can't <unclear> word </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#22:1:A> After hearing <,> what my client had to say <,,> I asked myself

<unclear> a couple words </unclear> if he was going to fabricate a story at

this point in time <,> <}> <-> he </-> <=> he </=> </}> knows what these

other <}> <-> witnesses </-> <=> witnesses </=> </}> are saying
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#23:1:A> None of them can say he did anything
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#24:1:A> If he was going to fabricate a story why wouldn't he <?> stay out

of </?> trouble if no one else was going to <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#25:1:A> Why wouldn't he say I didn't do it <,,> but he does
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#26:1:A> He does because he's not that <unclear> two words </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#27:1:A> Now <,,> my client readily admits <,> that <,> he punched Mister

<@> Eto </@> but he did not punch him <unclear> word </unclear> you'll recall

his testimony until Mister <@> Eto </@> <,> had started struggling <unclear>

word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#28:1:A> And the reason he punched Mister <@> Eto </@> is because Mister <@>

Eto </@> was trying to <unclear> two words </unclear> <,> trying to injure

him <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#29:1:A> And my client was very <?> animated </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#30:1:A> He said <quote> I punched him <,> once </quote> <&> Quote continues

</&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#31:1:A> And I suggest to you that that's <unclear> a few words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#32:1:A> You know that the officer when he examined my client's hand with

the <unclear> word </unclear> later that evening found a <?> nick </?> there
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#33:1:A> Well that <?> nick </?> was from Mister <@> Eto </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#34:1:A> That nick was from my client <,> putting Mister <@> Eto </@> in a

<unclear> word </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#35:1:A> Now when Mister <@> Eto </@> left <?> when he </?> was escorted out

he wasn't <unclear> two or three words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#36:1:A> And I suggest to you that that's the reason <unclear> two words

</unclear> my client hit him
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#37:1:A> My client only hit him <,> <unclear> three words </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#38:1:A> One of the other reasons why my client <unclear> word </unclear>

<,> <}> <-> <.> o </.> </-> <=> one </=> </}> of the other reasons why the

<?> initial altercation </?> at the coat check <unclear> three or four words

</unclear> is because Mister <@> Raoul Eto </@> <,> before anything else was

done reached up and grabbed my client by the collar and tore off his gold

chain <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#39:1:A> He tore off the gold chain that my client was wearing <,> and he

left a mark on my client's neck
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#40:1:A> And <?> I put his mother on the stand </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#41:1:A> She saw him the very next day
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#42:1:A> She said <?> his mother </?> testified that he had this mark
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#43:1:A> I tendered the gold chain as <}> <-> a </-> <=> an </=> </}>

exhibit and the reason I did that is because I want you people to go back to

that jury room to have a look at that gold chain
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#44:1:A> Look how thick that gold chain is
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#45:1:A> <?> It's not a </?> <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#46:1:A> Imagine <,> what type of a force was necessary to yank that off of

someone's neck <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#47:1:A> He yanked it off hard enough <,> that it left <unclear> two words

</unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#48:1:A> So <,,> what my client is saying about that being the <,> <?>

action <?> that started the whole incident <?> what do you think </?> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#49:1:A> <@> Raoul Eto </@> reached up grabbed him by the collar <,> breaks

his chain <,> he put Mister <@> Eto </@> in a headlock
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#50:1:A> At that same time Mister <@> Glen Hawker </@> came up to <?> him by

himself </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#51:1:A> And <,> Mister <@> Hawker </@> <,,> <}> <-> said </-> <=> <,>

<unclear> word </unclear> walks in and said </=> </}> <,> <unclear> maybe two

words </unclear> or just happened what's going on <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#52:1:A> Mister <@> Millner </@> <?> came in </?> said <quote> do you want a

piece of it too </quote> and pushed him up against the wall and he punched

him <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#53:1:A> Well ladies and gentlemen let me ask you this first of all <,> if

indeed Mister <@> Mick Millner </@> did say <quote> do you want a piece of it

too </quote> <,,> why would he push him up against the wall and strike him

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#54:1:A> Mister <@> Hawker </@> has given no response to that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#55:1:A> Mister <@> Hawker </@> hasn't <,> come at my client according to

Mister <@> Hawker </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#56:1:A> So why would my client do that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#57:1:A> My client is merely if indeed he did ask that is asking a question
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#58:1:A> He says <quote> do you want a piece of this too </quote> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#59:1:A> I suggest to you that Mister <@> Hawker </@> must have done

something he must have done something to my client to facilitate my client

grabbing him and pushing him up against the wall <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#60:1:A> And do you know what he did I suggest to you I suggest <unclear>

two words </unclear> that he grabbed my client by the shoulder <,> and he

grabbed my client to get him to let go <,> of his friend <@> Raoul Eto </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#61:1:A> And it's at that point in time Mister <@> Millner </@> <unclear>

three words </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#62:1:A> Let me also <?> put </?> to you ladies and gentlemen <,> he has

Mister <@> Raoul Eto </@> in one hand he has Mister <@> Glen Hawker </@> up

against the wall in the other hand <,> and then he's supposed to pull back

<,> and hit Mister <@> Hawker </@> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#63:1:A> Ladies and gentlemen <,> that would to me seem to be very difficult

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#64:1:A> Let me also point this out to you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#65:1:A> Mister <@> Hawker </@> had a cut above his eye
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#66:1:A> That's all he had
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#67:1:A> No stitches <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#68:1:A> No black eye <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#69:1:A> No bruising <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#70:1:A> Just a cut
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#71:1:A> And he couldn't <?> get a hospital to treat him </?> <unclear>

about three words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#72:1:A> That's <unclear> word </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#73:1:A> That was <?> it </?> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#74:1:A> I suggest to you ladies and gentlemen that <?> what indeed happened

</?> to Mister <@> Hawker </@> was <,> he grabbed my client by the shoulder
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#75:1:A> My client pushed him up against the wall <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#76:1:A> <unclear> a few words </unclear> because he didn't know at that

point in time exactly what Mister <@> Hawker </@> was going to do
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#77:1:A> And then <,> at that very same moment Mister <@> Montebank </@> <,>

came crashing in and my client <unclear> about three words </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#78:1:A> He let go of uh Mister <@> Hawker </@> up against the wall
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#79:1:A> And I suggest to you ladies and gentlemen that whatever injury

Mister <@> Hawker </@> suffered <unclear> two words </unclear> got cut <,> he

<?> suffered <?> after my client <?> let go of him </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#80:1:A> <?> There isn't </?> <unclear> word </unclear> any <unclear> maybe

four words </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#81:1:A> Mister <@> Hawker </@> any number of them could have cut him but my

client <?> was <?> not <?> one of them </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#82:1:A> My client denies <unclear> three words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#83:1:A> And I think ladies and gentlemen when you look at that <unclear>

two words </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#84:1:A> Bear in mind <,,> that <,,> when my client grabbed him <,,> he

didn't have any intention to injure him
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#85:1:A> <@> Mick </@> said <}> <-> I <}> <-> <.> woul </.> </-> <+> would

</+> </}> </-> <=> <quote> I <}> <-> <.> pla </.> </-> <=> pushed </=> </}>

</=> </}> him up against the wall </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#86:1:A> There is no indication in the testimony that <,> <@> Mick Millner

</@> intended in any way shape or form to injure <,> Mister uh <@> Hawker

</@> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#87:1:A> Uhh how about <@> Granada </@> Avenue
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#88:1:A> Let's go to that <?> thing </?> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#89:1:A> There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever from any of the

witnesses that <@> Mick Millner </@> had anything to do with <@> Raoul Eto

</@> out on <@> Granada </@> Avenue <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#90:1:A> The Crown's witnesses say <}> <-> they </-> <=> <,> they </=> </}>

didn't <unclear> two words </unclear> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#91:1:A> Out on <@> Granada </@> Avenue that skirmish that was going on back

there <,,> <@> Mick Millner </@> was not <?> a part of it </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#92:1:A> I spent a lot of time in cross examination going over the witnesses

where <@> Mick </@> actually was out on <@> Granada </@> Avenue <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#93:1:A> And <,> only three witnesses agree <unclear> maybe two words

</unclear> only three of the Crown witnesses agree <unclear> two words

</unclear> <?> say </?> what <@> Mick </@> was doing and where he was <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#94:1:A> <@> Charles Montebank </@> <,> said <,,> that he ran around

<unclear> two words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#95:1:A> Someone threw him on the ground hit his head can't remember

anything <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#96:1:A> <?> Okay </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#97:1:A> Well that's consistent with what Mister <@> Frank Wasylesko </@>

said
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#98:1:A> He said <,> he grabbed <@> Charles </@> <}> <-> threw him </-> <=>

threw him </=> </}> back and <unclear> two words </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#99:1:A> <?> We know </?> <@> Mick's </@> still not involved at this point

in time <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#100:1:A> <@> Colleen Paske </@> said <quote> Two guys were punching and

kicking <@> Charles </@> </quote> <&> quote continues </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#101:1:A> Ladies and gentlemen <unclear> quite a few words </unclear> going

on <unclear> word </unclear> <,> but what's going on <?> with Mister <@>

Raoul Eto </@> </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#102:1:A> They <?> wouldn't do that </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#103:1:A> They <unclear> quite a few words </unclear> Mister <@> Raoul Eto

</@> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#104:1:A> He was curled up on the ground <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#105:1:A> They didn't stop <unclear> the rest of utterance </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#106:1:A> <unclear> word </unclear> ladies and gentlemen <unclear> a few

words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#107:1:A> <@> Ron Craw </@> <,> a <?> strong </?> <unclear> word </unclear>

you'll recall what he said
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#108:1:A> He said <quote> <@> Mick </@> was on the other side of the street

with <@> Charles </@> </quote> <&> Quote continues </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#109:1:A> Clearly strong evidence as to what happened on <@> Granada </@>

Avenue <,> between <@> Mick </@> and <@> Chalres </@> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#110:1:A> Recall Mister <@> Craw's </@> very emotional <?> outburst </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#111:1:A> I know those words are still in your mind <,,>

punching or hitting <@> Charles </@> </quote> <&> Quote continues </&> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#113:1:A> That's what I copied down from what Mister <@> Craw </@> said <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#114:1:A> As you'll recall it <unclear> word </unclear> seem like the end of

a like I said <?> <}> <-> a </-> <=> an </=> </}> emotional outburst from

Mister <@> Craw </@> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#115:1:A> And that <,> ladies and gentlemen is exactly what my client said

he was doing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#116:1:A> He said he went out onto <@> Granada </@> Avenue <,> got there <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#117:1:A> He took Mister uh <@> Charles Montebank </@> from <@> Frank

Wasylesko </@> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#118:1:A> <@> Colleen </@> was holding onto him
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#119:1:A> Pulled her away
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#120:1:A> He pulled <@> Charles </@> away from <@> Colleen </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#121:1:A> Turned him around <,> and walked back into the bar
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#122:1:A> He didn't appear to be <?> unconscious </?> to <@> Mick </@> <,>

but you know he could have been dazed <unclear> maybe three words </unclear>

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#123:1:A> <?> He even says that </?> perhaps <,> that he fell on the

pavement
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#124:1:A> He <?> didn't </?> <unclear> maybe three words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#125:1:A> Of course he was going to be somewhat dazed maybe somewhat unsure

of himself or maybe <?> somewhat </?> unconscious <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#126:1:A> Now the Crown is going to suggest to you <,> that <,,> my client

must have done something out there because <@> Charles Montebank </@> was

unconscious at this point in time and because <,> <@> Charles Montebank </@>

doesn't remember anything that happened between that time and the time he

came back to the back hallway <,,> but <,,> ask yourself these questions
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#127:1:A> If he was unconscious why would <@> Mick Millner </@> <?> say to

him </?> <,> <quote> come on you're under arrest </quote> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#128:1:A> Why would he talk to someone who's unconscious
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#129:1:A> That doesn't make sense <,,> <O> cough </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#130:1:A> What about <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#131:1:A> <unclear> about three words </unclear> testimony that we know what

happened out on <@> Ninety-third </@> Street
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#132:1:A> We know Mister <@> Montebank </@> ran away <,> on <@> Ninety-third

</@> Street
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#133:1:A> Ask yourself <,> <?> how can </?> an unconscious man <unclear> two

words </unclear> run away <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#134:1:A> <unclear> sentence </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#135:1:A> <?> I don't think </?> Mister <@> Montebank </@> was unconscious
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#136:1:A> At the very <,> most I'd say Mister <@> Montebank </@> was

<unclear> rest of utterance </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#137:1:A> <unclear> sentence </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#138:1:A> Then not by my client Mister <@> Mick Millner </@> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#139:1:A> Now <,> remember too Mister <@> Craw </@> was fairly confident <}>

<-> that </-> <=> that </=> </}> <@> Mick </@> or <}> <-> that </-> <=> that

</=> </}> <@> Charles Montebank </@> was unconscious but it was dark out

there <,> and Mister <@> Craw </@> <?> just walked past <?> uh <@> Mick </@>

and <@> Charles </@> and really didn't stick around he <?> didn't <?>

<unclear> a few words </unclear> <?> made a comment </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#140:1:A> Here's what I think <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#141:1:A> It's quite possible very possible that what he saw was <,> Mister

<@> Montebank </@> <unclear> rest of utterance </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#142:1:A> Now how about this <?> <@> Ninety-third </@> Street incident </?>

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#143:1:A> <@> Charles </@> can't remember it the very individual that ran

away can't even remember
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#144:1:A> <@> Raoul </@> didn't see it <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#145:1:A> <@> Don Craw </@> <@> Anne Kramer </@> <@> Wanda </@> <@> Colleen

<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#146:1:A> Some people did though
<ICE-CAN:S2A-062#147:1:A> <@> Mike Treadle </@> <,> he said <quote> <@> Charles </@> ran

away from the doorman </quote> but <@> Mike </@> can't I D <unclear> two
