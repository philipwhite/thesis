<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-006#1:1> Edwardian England came into being with the accession of King

Edward VII on the 22 January 1901.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#2:1> For the purpose of this paper the Edwardian era is taken as having

ended not with the death of the King in 1910 but with the outbreak of the

First World War on 4 August 1914.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#3:1> Although this era is often thought to be one of great wealth, promise

and grandeur, hence its referral as <quote> " the Golden era" </quote> this

paper will prove otherwise.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#4:1> To disclaim this belief, an examination of the social, economic and

political activities of bourgeois women is required. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-006#5:1> Women in Edwardian England had come to feel that they wanted to

claim a status apart from the traditional feminine role of wife and mother.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#6:1> They were going to refuse the appointed labors of washing, cooking,

cleaning and serving.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#7:1> In essence they were no longer going to conform to the masculist

standards and regulations of the era.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#8:1> The fact that women were producing fewer children in comparison to

earlier eras, <quote> " the birth rate had fallen from 36.3 per 1000

population in the 1870's to 28.5 in 1901" </quote> demonstrates their desire

to break free of the reproductive role expected of them ( Read 1972, 21)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#9:1> Being less burdened with the duties of pregnancies and domestic

affairs women desired to participate within the political and economic

activities of the time.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#10:1> However their desire to participate within these spheres and their

refusal to accept the reproductive role constructed for them was not welcomed

by the males in society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#11:1> Men tried to make women feel guilty for betraying their biological

function of procreation.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#12:1> It was said that women were upsetting the <quote> " natural order"

</quote> of things, and they were blamed for the limited numbers of men

available for military and naval recruitment ( Read 1972, 24.)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#13:1> It seems that for the most part, women were not considered as

independent persons but as integral parts of the family.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#14:1> Men desired that these bourgeois women drop their current pursuit and

resume their subservient role of yester-years.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#15:1> It was thought that the ideal role for women was to continue being

<}> <-> nurturant </-> <+> nurturing </+> </}> , emotional, fragile, passive,

compliant and submissive.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#16:1> Any deviance from these qualities caused men to feel threatened.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#17:1> For the more a woman withdraws into the home and gentility the more

the arenas of government and industry are left to men and men's values.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#18:1> For the more a servant the women was the more a master the man was.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#19:1> For the softer and weaker and more dependent the women was the

stronger and more powerful the appearance of the man.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#20:1> As can be seen the sexes were to complement one another.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#21:1> The Edwardian patriarchical system based on the general <}> <->

principal </-> <+> principle </+> </}> that men rule and women obey, carried

with it inferior <}> <-> stereo-types </-> <+> stereotypes </+> </}> and

masculist attitudes, proving that this era brought exploitation and

oppression to the lives of bourgeois women. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-006#22:1> Edwardian middle-class women enjoyed more career opportunities

than their middle-class predecessors of the Victorian era.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#23:1> This broadened opportunity was in part to due to the 1908 Labour

movement which favoured economic and social equality between the sexes.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#24:1> Alas women were going to be able to enter into fields besides

domestic services.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#25:1> For <quote> " the young girl of today prefers to become a Board

school mistress, a post-office clerk, a typewriter, a shop girl, anything

rather than domestic service" </quote> ( Nowell-Smith 1964, 143).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#26:1> However, the belief that women were not competent at any task except

those traditionally designated " women's work" plagued the new philosophy of

equality.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#27:1> Clerical, teaching and shop keeping were jobs believed to be "

feminine" in nature.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#28:1> In 1901 the percentage of women clerks was 18%, compared to 32% in

1911 ( Nowell-Smith 1964, 187).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#29:1> On the surface this increase seems positive, however it does not seem

as positive when comparing it to the percentage of women still employed in

domestic service.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#30:1> In 1911 nearly 2,600,000 people were engaged as servants, over

2,100,000 or approximately 81% of these people were women ( Read 1972, 26)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#31:1> Although middle class women might have preferred to be employed

outside the domestic service, the evidence shown proves that their desire to

do so was not fulfilled.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#32:1> The limits put on employment opportunities were not the only economic

constraints.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#33:1> Bourgeois women also encountered limitations on their earnings. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-006#34:1> With very few exceptions, women could still expect to earn much

less than men for the same work.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#35:1> In domestic service the position of butler earned the top wage for a

man, he could earn as much as L100 year.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#36:1> The top wage of women within the domestic service was L80 (

Nowell-Smith 1994, 145).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#37:1> On the surface this difference in wage does not seem that extreme

however, it is when comparing the duties of a butler to the duties of a

cook-housekeeper that the inequality of wages strikes one as being

phenomenal.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#38:1> The bottom line was that women had to do more work for less pay.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#39:1> This inequality proves itself in the next quote <quote> " there was

an increasing disinclination to employ men-servants, who were more expensive,

less biddable, and needed a license costing 15s.," </quote> ( Nowell-Smith

1964, 44)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#40:1> There is no doubt, women's labour was far cheaper than mens. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-006#41:1> The rationale behind women experiencing an inequality of wages

finds its roots in a particular attitude.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#42:1> The attitude was that men being the bread winners were therefore

entitled to earn more than female workers
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#43:1> It was believed after all, that women were just supplementary wage

earners, their earnings were seen as complementing the males within the

household.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#44:1> The limits imposed on bourgeois women's employment opportunities and

earnings kept women inferior in status and economically dependent on men.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#45:1> In light of the economic life that middle-class women were subjected

to, the Edwardian era does not seem full of promise. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-006#46:1> Edwardian women did not enjoy a golden era in the realms of

politics either.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#47:1> Many Royal Commissions were set up to review numerous social

regulations existing in Edwardian society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#48:1> The Royal Commission on Divorce and Matrimonial Causes set up in 1909

is just one example.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#49:1> It was appointed <quote> " to inquire into the legal disabilities

under which married women laboured" </quote> ( Cecil 1969 178).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#50:1> Finally, after three years the recommendations were given.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#51:1> Among other recommendations, the commission stated that women should

be allowed equality with men before the law with respect to grounds for

divorce ( Cecil 1969, 178).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#52:1> Although the recommendations were voiced in 1912, well within the

Edwardian period, they were not enacted until the 1920's
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#53:1> In fact, the recommendations made by many of the commissions were

also neglected until after the Edwardian period.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#54:1> Proving once again that Edwardian middle class women did not enjoy a

political period that was golden. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-006#55:1> Even though women were allowed to vote in local elections, and a

Liberal act in 1907 allowed them to serve upon county councils, women were

still prohibited in regards to the Parliamentary franchise.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#56:1> The two franchises were differentiated on the ground that <quote> "

local government impinged directly upon women's domestic pre-occupations"

</quote> and was therefore suitable for women ( Read 1972, 208).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#57:1> The National government, however which focused on matters of foreign

affairs, war and finance was held to be beyond the understanding and

capacities of women.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#58:1> The subject of the vote for women caused much debate between the

sexes within the middle class.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#59:1> The focus of one debate was whether or not women were physically and

psychologically capable of bearing the responsibilities which would accompany

the extensions of their present rights.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#60:1> It was decided that women would not be able to handle the extensions

based on the following four reasons: 1. Women were physically weak.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#61:1> 2. Women were not able to work with each other.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#62:1> 3. Women had a negative effect on men's work.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#63:1> 4. Women thought subjectively and were therefore irrational. ( Read

1972, 211)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#64:1> The results of this debate and other similar debates proved to

heighten the opposition regarding the issue of female emancipation. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-006#65:1> To <}> <-> counter act </-> <+> counteract </+> </}> debates such

as the preceding one, middle-class women organized themselves into Women's

Suffragist groups
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#66:1> It was clear to them that because men still believed women to be

inferior that they were going to have to fight for the right to vote.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#67:1> Probably the most notorious women's group was the Women's Social and

Political Uunion
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#68:1> The W.S.P.U. was founded on October 10 1903 and was headed by

Emmmeline Pankhurst and her daughters Cristabel and Sylvia.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#69:1> Women believed that the vote would lead to higher wages, economic

independence, increased job opportunities, and most importantly legal

equality.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#70:1> It was further believed that by improving the position of women that

the relations between men and women would benefit too.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#71:1> The Suffragette's first attempts at being recognized were

unsuccessful, <quote> every year, on the opening day of Parliament, the

association sent a deputation of women to the House of Commons, to meet

so-called friendly Members and consider the position of the women's suffrage

cause. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#X72:1> The ladies made their speeches and the men <}> <-> mad </-> <+> made

</+> </}> theirs.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#X73:1> The ladies thanked the friendly Members for their sympathy, and the

Members renewed their assurances that they believed in women's suffrage and

would vote for it when they had an opportunity to do so.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#X74:1> Then the deputation, ... took its departure, and the Members resumed

the real business of life, .... </X> </quote> . ( Mackenzie, 1975, 20)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#75:1> As can be seen militancy was not part of the women's movement in the

early days.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#76:1> However, as opposition against the women's movement increased, the

morality behind the tactics used by Mrs. Pankhurst's members decreased. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-006#77:1> Middle class women were tiring from the little attention paid to

them by politicians and the press, and in 1905 their campaign turned to

various form of militant action.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#78:1> Women had come to feel <quote> " that they must now act in such a way

as to prove that the Suffragists would no longer quietly submit to this

perpetual ignoring of their claims" </quote> ( Mackenzie 1975,47.)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#79:1> This was the beginning of a campaign the like of which was never

known in England, or for that matter, in any other country.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#80:1> The interruption of political meetings, the dispersal of propaganda

<}> <-> thru </-> <+> through </+> </}> pamphlets, and the willingness to be

imprisoned for these acts, were the first militant acts carried out.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#81:1> These early militant acts especially the prison sentences proved

successful in gaining some attention and sympathy.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#82:1> The most attention came from the press, whose silence up until then

had <quote> " largely smothered and strangled the movement" </quote> (

Mackenzie 1975, 32).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#83:1> Although some recognition resulted from these early military acts

they were not successful in evoking a response from the government.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#84:1> Desperately wanting the Liberal government to answer their cry of

female suffrage, women found it necessary to increase the militancy of their

campaign. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-006#85:1> The new and intensified campaign with its policy being <quote> "

Prison, or Votes for Women" </quote> was going to take the issue of women's

suffrage to the forefront.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#86:1> There was to be no peace until women were recognized and treated as

equal.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#87:1> Emmeline Pankhurst sums up the emotions that the Suffragettes were

feeling when she says, <quote> " Prison, Votes for Women, and at the moment I

feel I might be in prison all my life" </quote> ( Mackenzie 1975, 29).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#88:1> The members of the W.S.P.U. were instructed by Mrs. Pankhurst to

resemble an army and not give thought to the consequences of their actions.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#89:1> Militant acts involved window smashing, arson, bomb explosions and

prison terms.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#90:1> These prison terms compared to their initial imprisonments were

longer and more severe.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#91:1> While serving their prison terms these radical women went on hunger

strikes.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#92:1> Their extremism was met by a Liberal government's unprecedented

decision to force feed the striking inmates.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#93:1> Force feeding taking both oral and rectal forms aroused widespread

criticism among Edwardian civilians.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#94:1> In response to the criticism the 'Cat and Mouse' Act was enacted in

1913.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#95:1> This act deemed that the Parliament's procedures of force feeding

while inhumane were sometimes necessary.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#96:1> <quote> <X> " Our former Laws have been adequate in dealing with

ordinary prisoners, but a new set of prisoners have come" </X> </quote> (

Mackenzie 1975, 230).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#97:1> The act granted temporary release to ailing Suffragists in order to

recover their health.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#98:1> After their health was restored they were to return to prison and

serve the rest of their sentence.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#99:1> The government also issued another unprecedented decision, which was

the power to release without remission of sentence.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#100:1> In the case of Emmeline Pankhurst this meant that the fifteen days

that she took for recovery outside of the prison would be tacked unto her

original sentence, so that she would indeed spend a full three years in

prison ( Mackenzie 1975, 230).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#101:1> It was hoped that the 'Cat and Mouse Act' would break the

Suffragist's cycle of: defying the law, threatening to commit militant acts,

being sent to prison, being let out in a few days to be militant again.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-006#102:1> The Liberal government's histrionic decisions although producing a

negative effect for themselves actually increased sympathy towards the

imprisoned Suffragists. </p> </I>
