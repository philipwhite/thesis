<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-012#4:1> <bold> <smallcaps> ABSTRACT </smallcaps> </bold>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#5:1> Briefly presented target lines are reported more accurately when part

of an object-like context than alone ( Williams & Weisstein, 1978).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#6:1> Efforts to explain this effect have tended to focus on structural

properties that contexts must possess in order to be effective in

facilitating target-line discrimination ( e.g., Weisstein, Williams, &

Harris, 1982).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#7:1> Enns and Prinzmetal ( 1984) take issue with this approach.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#8:1> They propose that contexts differ more from one another than do target

lines presented alone, and it is this fact, and not the general structural

properties of contexts, that underlies their effectiveness.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#9:1> Two experiments examined intercontext differences and structural

factors as determinants of context effectiveness.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#10:1> Subjects were found to use intercontext differences to narrow the

range of possible alternatives, but when this factor was controlled,

structural properties determined context effectiveness.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#11:1> The structural interpretation of context effectiveness was found not

to be as straight <l> forward as generally assumed, however.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#12:1> A third experiment showed context effec <l> tiveness to be affected

by the character of the discrimination task employed. </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#X14:1> Des lignes-cibles pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es bri&egrave;vement sont

rapport&eacute;es avec plus de pr&eacute;cision lorsqu'elles font partie d'un

contexte figural que pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es toutes seules ( Williams &

Weisstein, 1978).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#X15:1> Les efforts pour expliquer cet effet se sont concen <l> tr&eacute;s

sur les propri&eacute;t&eacute;s structurales que le contexte doit

Weisstein, Williams, & Harris, 1982).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#X16:1> Enns et Prinzmetal ( 1984) ont consid&eacute;r&eacute; cette

approche.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#X17:1> Ils proposent que les contextes diff&egrave;rent plus l'un de

l'autre que les lignes-cibles pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es seules et c'est ce

fait, et non pas les propri&eacute;t&eacute;s structurales

g&eacute;n&eacute;rales des contextes, qui sous-tend leur efficacit&eacute;.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#X18:1> Deux exp&eacute;riences examinaient les diff&eacute;rences

intercontextes et les fac <l> teurs structuraux comme d&eacute;terminants de

l'efficacit&eacute; du contexte.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#X19:1> On a montr&eacute; que les sujets utilisaient les diff&eacute;rences

intercontexts pour retr&eacute;cir l'&eacute;tendue des alter <l> natives

contr&ocircumflex;l&eacute;, les propri&eacute;t&eacute;s structu <l> rales

d&eacute;terminaient l'efficacit&eacute; du contexte.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#X20:1> L'interpr&eacute;tation structurale de l'efficacit&eacute; du

<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#X21:1> Une troi <l> si&egrave;me exp&eacute;rience a montr&eacute; que

l'efficacit&eacute; du contexte &eacute;tait affect&eacute;e par le carac <l>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-012#22:1> Briefly presented line segments can be discriminated more

accurately within an object-like context than alone ( Williams & Weisstein,

1978).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#23:1> This finding has been termed the object-line effect ( OLE).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#24:1> It has attracted much attention because it is con <l> trary to

expectation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#25:1> Normally, briefly exposed, adjacent line segments interfere with one

another through lateral inhibitory processes ( Breitmeyer, 1984).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#26:1> Line seg <l> ments, therefore, should be more accurately

discriminated when presented alone than when included as one of many line

segments constituting a context. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-012#27:1> Not all contexts are effective in facilitating line

discrimination.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#28:1> Weisstein and her associates have shown that contexts which are

coherent ( i.e., present a unitary configuration), connected ( i.e., have a

continuous contour), and three dimensional ( i.e., have a depth inducing

perspective) are effective in facilitating discrimination of constituent line

detail, and contexts lacking these characteristics are not ( e.g., Lanze,

Maguire, & Weisstein, 1985; Lanze, Weisstein, & Harris, 1982; Weisstein,

Williams, & Harris, 1982; Williams & Weisstein, 1978).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#29:1> Weisstein and her associates suggest that structural properties such

as coherence, connectedness, and three dimensionality increase the

discriminability of contexts and allow them to be processed more rapidly than

contexts lacking these properties or target lines presented alone. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-012#30:1> An alternative interpretation of the OLE has been recently

advanced by Enns and Prinzmetal ( 1984).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#31:1> They suggest that in analyzing the OLE, attention should not be <}>

<-> focussed </-> <+> focused </+> </}> on the structural properties of

contexts, but on the degree to which con <l> texts differ from one another in

appearance and the degree to which such differences are greater than those

evident among target lines presented alone.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#32:1> They contend that, in studies demonstrating an OLE, contexts

containing target lines differ more from one another than do members of the

set of target lines presented alone.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#33:1> Since each different context is associated with a particular

target-line location, subjects can use the distinctive appearance of

individual contexts as a basis for inferring which target line has been

presented.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#34:1> Under such circumstances, better performance is to be expected when

target lines are presented within contexts than when they are presented

alone.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#35:1> The feasibility of the Enns and Prinzmetal approach has been much

strength <l> ened by their demonstration that intercontext dissimilarity, in

the absence of any general configural property such as three dimensionality,

connectedness, or coher <l> ence, can generate an OLE and that making

information provided by intercontext differences difficult to use reduces or

eliminates the OLE. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-012#36:1> The research to be reported examines the Enns and Prinzmetal (

1984) position.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#37:1> It was prompted by doubts that the effectiveness of a given set of

contexts can be wholly attributed to intercontext differences.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#38:1> The principal objective was to deter <l> mine whether context effects

attributable to the stimulus properties of contexts can be demonstrated if

intercontext configural dissimilarities are controlled. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#39:1> <h> EXPERIMENT 1 </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-012#40:1> Experiment 1 was a preliminary study with two objectives.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#41:1> One objective was to examine Enns and Prinzmetal's ( 1984) claim that

subjects use intercontext differ <l> ences correlated with target-line

location to specify acceptable alternatives in studies of the OLE.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#42:1> The other objective was to try and determine whether, with intercon

<l> text differences controlled, evidence could be obtained to show that the

structural properties of contexts remain as an important determinant of the

OLE. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#43:1> <h> <it> Method </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-012#44:1> <it> Design and Materials </it> : Subjects were required to

specify the position of a broken target line presented alone and within two

structurally different types of contexts.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#45:1> The two different types of contexts are shown in Panel A of Figure 1.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#46:1> It may be seen that each of the contexts was aligned in two different

ways.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#47:1> At each alignment, only two of the four broken target-line <O> Table

</O> <O> Figure 1 caption </O> locations were appropriate targets.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#48:1> If the long axis of either context was aligned vertically, a target

line could be located on the left or the right.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#49:1> If the long axis of either context was aligned horizontally, the

target line could occur at the top or bottom.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#50:1> Context alignment was thus correlated with target-line location.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#51:1> If subjects are as sensitive to configural variations in contexts as

Enns and Prinzmetal ( 1984) suggest, they should readily discern the

consequences of context orientation and utilize this information to narrow

down the range of appropriate response alternatives.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#52:1> As a consequence, they should make few errors that involve alterna

<l> tives inappropriate with respect to the orientation of a given context.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-012#53:1> Although the orientation information provided by the two contexts

is identical, the two con <l> texts are very different structurally.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#54:1> One context is flat and unconnected, the other is con <l> nected and

three dimensional.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#55:1> If Weisstein is correct and the structural properties of contexts is

an important determinant of the OLE, then the connected, three-dimensional

context should generate an OLE effect and the flat, unconnected context

should not.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#56:1> Further, any differences generated should not be attributable to

intercontext differences correlated with target-line loca <l> tions of the

type described by Enns and Prinzmetal ( 1984).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#57:1> Employing a <it> single </it> connected, three-dimensional context

and a <it> single </it> flat, unconnected context, rather than a set of

different contexts exemplifying each context type, eliminates intercontext

configural differences of the type described by Enns and Prinzmetal.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#58:1> The only variation in context appearance in both con <l> nected

three-dimensional and unconnected two-dimensional forms is that associated

with orientation, and variations associated with orientation are identical

for both types of contexts.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#59:1> Any overall difference between lines presented in context and alone

should reflect the ease or difficulty subjects have in determining the

position of target-line locations as a function of the structural properties

of the two contexts employed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-012#60:1> An Imagewriter printer directed by an Apple 2e computer was used

to generate the central square of three-dimensional contexts and to introduce

broken target lines at the requisite posi <l> tions.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#61:1> Angular wing-like appendages were added by a Koh-I-Nor drafting pen

with a 0.6 mm nib.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#62:1> The number and length and type of the line components used in the

unconnected, flat context were the same as those used in the

three-dimensional context, and the positioning of broken target lines vis

&agrave; vis the fixation point in outer locations of the unconnected context

was identical to that used in the three-dimensional context.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#63:1> The connected and unconnected contexts subtended visual angles of

2.3&degree; and 2.1&degree;, respectively, along the long axis and

1.7&degree; and 1.8&degree;, respectively, along the short axis.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#64:1> Target lines subtended a visual angle of 1.1&degree;.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#65:1> Eight naive subjects participated in the experiment in exchange for

course credit points. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-012#66:1> <it> Procedure </it> : A forced choice procedure required

subjects to specify the position of the target line after each presentation

by pointing to one of the four possible target-line locations dis <l> played

on a response card.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#67:1> Twenty-four item presentation blocks were used, and within each

block, target lines appeared alone and in each of the two different contexts

equally often.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#68:1> Both context orientations and all four target-line locations were

sampled equally often within each block.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#69:1> Drawings of various contexts and lines examined were provided before

the start of the study and were available for consultation throughout the

experiment.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#70:1> No information was provided about the fact that horizontal and

vertical alignments of contexts could be used to narrow the range of relevant

target-line locations.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#71:1> To familiarize subjects with the general procedure, a block of

practice presentations preceded the eight blocks of experimental presen <l>

tations.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#72:1> A Gerbrands two-field tachistoscope was used to present stimuli.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#73:1> A uniformly illu <l> minated preexposure field containing a small

fixation dot preceded and followed the exposure field.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#74:1> As in the Enns and Prinzmetal ( 1984) study, subjects were required

to maintain a predeter <l> mined level of accuracy in responding.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#75:1> The required accuracy level of 50-70% correct responding was

established by holding the illumination level of the exposure field of the

tachistoscope fixed at 1.7 cd/m <sp> 2 </sp> and varying the illumination

level of the uniform field preceding and following the exposure field.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#76:1> The preliminary practice period was used to establish an appropriate

performance level.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#77:1> As in the Enns and Prinzmetal study, further adjustments were made,

if necessary, only at the end of a presentation block after all conditions

had been presented an equal number of times.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#78:1> The mean level of illumination of the field which preceded and

followed the exposure field was 3.1 cd/m <sp> 2 </sp> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#79:1> A fixed exposure duration of 20 ms was used throughout the study.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#80:1> Subjects were provided no feedback with respect to the accuracy of

their responses during the study. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#81:1> <h> <it> Results </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-012#82:1> To determine whether typically observed object-line effects were

evident, the proportion of presentations on which target lines were

designated correctly was tabu <l> lated for each condition.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#83:1> The mean proportion of target lines correctly specified was higher

for target lines within the connected, three-dimensional context than within

the flat, unconnected context or than when presented alone ( .82, .59, & .55,

respec <l> tively).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#84:1> An analysis of variance applied to arc sine transformed proportions

indi <l> cated that presentation conditions differed reliably, <it> F </it> (

2, 14) = 13.46, <it> p </it> < .001. 
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#85:1> Planned comparison tests showed that target lines were discerned

significantly more accurately in the three-dimensional context than in the

two-dimensional context, <it> t </it> ( 14) = 4.81, <it> p </it>

< .05, or than when presented alone,  <it> t </it> ( 14) = 4.20, <it> p </it>

< .05. 
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#86:1> Differ <l> ences in the accuracy with which target lines were

discriminated in the flat, two-dimensional context and line-alone condition

did not differ reliably. </p> <O> Table </O> <O> Table caption </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-012#87:1> Finding that the two contexts differed in the degree to which

they facilitated target-line location supports the Weisstein et al. ( 1982)

position that structural properties of contexts are important, but is

difficult to reconcile with the approach of Enns and Prinzmetal ( 1984).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#88:1> According to Enns and Prinzmetal, pronounced intercon <l> text

configural differences have to be evident among the exemplars of a given con

<l> text type, and these differences have to be correlated with target-line

locations for variations in context effectiveness to be manifest.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#89:1> In the present study, each context type was represented by a single

configuration.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#90:1> The only variation in contexts cor <l> related with target-line

location was that associated with context alignment, and that, as has been

noted, was identical for both context types. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-012#91:1> To determine whether subjects took advantage of context alignment

to narrow the range of appropriate alternatives, the total number of errors

made by each subject were divided according to whether the alternative

selected matched the orientation of the target line presented or was

nonmatching, that is, orthogonal to the orienta <l> tion the target line

presented.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#92:1> An analysis of variance carried out on the error data indicated that

there were reliable main effects for error type, <it> F </it> ( 1, 7) = 5.67,

<it> p </it> < .05, presentation conditions,  <it> F </it> ( 2, 14) = 12.69,

<it> p </it> < .001, and an interaction between presen tation conditions and

error type, <it> F </it> ( 2, 14) = 32.22, <it> p </it> < .001. 
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#93:1> The summary of error data provided in Table 1 shows that the most

important factor contributing to the interaction is the marked difference in

error patterns between the context and line-alone conditions.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#94:1> In context conditions, errors involving appropriately oriented

alternatives were more common than errors involving inappropriately oriented

alterna <l> tives, whereas in the line-alone condition the reverse was true.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#95:1> Why errors involving inappropriately oriented alternatives were twice

as frequent in the line-alone condi <l> tion ( 19.63 vs. 9.50) as errors

involving appropriately oriented alternatives is difficult to understand.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#96:1> Inspection of presentation sequences and tabulation operations

reveals no indication of anomalies that could account for the effect.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-012#97:1> Although not readily explained, the distribution of error types in

the line-alone condition is of only limited interest. </p> </I>
