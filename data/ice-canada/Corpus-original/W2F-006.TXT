<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#2:1> Charles Cole

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#3:1> After graduating from university, I couldn't decide what to do

with the rest of my life.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#4:1> My mind seemed like it was fogged-in off the coast of New <l>

foundland; ships could neither sail in nor out.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#5:1> I didn't know what to do.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#6:1> Was I eating properly?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#7:1> No.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#8:1> Was I meeting people, new friends?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#9:1> No.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#10:1> I couldn't think clearly enough to do any of these things.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#11:1> I had no sense of purpose.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#12:1> I knew I couldn't communicate with others.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#13:1> All these marvellous skills everyone else in the world had I had

completely lost. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#14:1> On the eleventh day it began to rain.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#15:1> The rain beat down on the vari <l> ous surfaces outside my window,

such as the ground, the sill, even the cat I had at the time, which I would

stick out the window until it got wet enough to require drying.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#16:1> Afterwards, it lay snugly in my arms, purring, which I found somewhat

satisfying.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#17:1> I kept thinking I had very little money left; I ate little; and I

often stayed in my room all day without once going out into the city.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#18:1> The streets frightened me with their noise.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#19:1> The auto <l> mobiles seemed angry at me — when the traffic light

turned red, they screeched to a halt, I tried to cross, but they inched

forward menacingly as if I had no right to be there. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#20:1> The next day the cat meowed for her food.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#21:1> I offered her some bread, which she ate, then I unrolled my

university diploma and examined it for a second.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#22:1> I tried squinting at it, blurring my vision, trying to change the "

B.A." into a " BSc."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#23:1> This made me feel almost human.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#24:1> I chose a task, any task: I decided to go to the university to have

my diploma photocopied ( a highly useful first step, I reasoned).
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#25:1> I dressed without incident.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#26:1> Some of the clothes — a gift from my mother — I had never seen

before.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#27:1> They were new and had to be taken out of their packages, and the

price tags had to be clipped off, fifteen in all, which I arranged

numerically as I meticulously rehearsed what I was going to say to the person

at the photocopy service: </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#28:1> " Hello.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#29:1> How are you?"
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#30:1> ( To which the woman behind the counter at the photocopy service did

not respond.) </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#31:1> And: " I would like this photocopied." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#32:1> When I said this, the young woman took my diploma, unrolled it,

and read it from beginning to end.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#33:1> A slight smile played upon her lips, threat <l> ening to break out at

any moment.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#34:1> In fact, I could see she wanted to laugh.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#35:1> And now she peered intently at my face and particularly my hair,

which was sandy blond and straight ( but not wispy). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#36:1> " How many do you want?" she asked. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#37:1> " I don't know," I said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#38:1> " How many do you think I should have?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#39:1> The young woman looked back at me without saying anything.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#40:1> I smiled encouragingly.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#41:1> I imagined I heard the clock on the wall behind her tick, which was

impossible over the sound of the machines. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#42:1> " You're sending it out with your r&eacute;sum&eacute;, I take

it?" she asked. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#43:1> Again, I couldn't answer her.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#44:1> I had never thought of sending out my r&eacute;sum&eacute;.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#45:1> I would have to think about it.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#46:1> Five seconds, ten seconds ticked by on the clock's face.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#47:1> Not only could I hear it, I thought I saw a cuckoo bird break through

the clock's face to announce her opinion of me. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#48:1> " If you want to work here in the library," the young woman said, "

there's probably something here for you.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#49:1> But you'll have to see the per <l> sonnel officer." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#50:1> She then stepped out from behind the counter and opened a door.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#51:1> There was a long, well lit corridor. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#52:1> " Go right down there and to your right," she said, pointing.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#53:1> Oh, there she is.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#54:1> Mrs O'Brian!
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#55:1> Mrs O'Brian!" she shouted. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#56:1> A woman just coming out of her office turned towards us.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#57:1> The photo <l> copy clerk started pointing at my head. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#58:1> " He wants to see you, Carole." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#59:1> In those days, libraries were desperate for people, and Mrs

O'Brian stopped whatever it was she was doing to see me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#60:1> I didn't even get a chance to sit down, or talk to her about what I

wanted to do.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#61:1> She unrolled my diploma, asked me a few questions about my major, and

that was it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#62:1> " There are a number of vacant positions," she said, " but I have

a hunch you'll like the Religious Studies Library.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#63:1> If you want it, I'll send you over right now.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#64:1> It's in the old Redpath mansion.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#65:1> You know it?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#66:1> I'm sure you'll feel quite at home there."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#67:1> I asked her what it was like. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#68:1> " Quiet," she said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#69:1> Never had I been so powerfully carried along by events.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#70:1> Every word spoken to me had been warm, every facial expression

friendly.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#71:1> Only some <l> one immune, a monster, could remain indifferent.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#72:1> I almost believed my stars had somehow become aligned in the corridor

I had just left joining the photocopy service and the personnel office.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#73:1> And I was now walking along campus paths I had never really felt I

had a right to use.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#74:1> I knew the Religious Studies Library and the old Redpath mansion that

housed it.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#75:1> I heard other students refer to it as a German " pile," perhaps

because the bricks used to construct its walls had become almost black over

the years, from pollution, and it had none of the gaily painted gables and

lattice that buildings built in the Victorian style had, nothing to offset

the gloom and sobriety.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#76:1> The head librarian, Miss Henchey, was waiting for me out <l> side on

the front steps. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#77:1> " In case you missed us," she said shaking my hand warmly.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#78:1> " I'm Miss Henchey &dotted-line; but I suppose you already know that.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#79:1> Please." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#80:1> She held the front door open so that I could go in first. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#81:1> Once inside, I was struck, not by the physical sensation of

smelling, but by how much the smell of an object, a room, is shaped by the

mental state we are in, for before, when I had entered this mansion as a

student, the old books lining the walls of the corridor smelled dank and

mouldy, whereas they now smelled sweet.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#82:1> We entered a room that must once have been a kitchen, then another,

smaller room that had Miss Henchey's name on the door. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#83:1> " Sit down," she said indicating a chair covered in cracked

leather that I found to be perfectly comfortable.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#84:1> Suddenly, Miss Henchey's smile van <l> ished; she looked nervous,

even frightened. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#85:1> " Stuffy?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#86:1> You don't find this office stuffy, do you?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#87:1> Never mind &dotted-line; ."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#88:1> Standing up, she walked over to the window and flung it wide open,

then she sat down again.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#89:1> " Let in some fresh air, huh.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#90:1> You look thin, Mr Saks; we'll have to fatten you up.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#91:1> And you look pale; we have a sunny courtyard where you should walk

during your lunch hour." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#92:1> Miss Henchey went on to what I would be required to do: shelving

books, serving students at the desk, and answering simple reference ques <l>

tions.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#93:1> She briefly explained what a library was: " There is an archival func

<l> tion, of course, where we must preserve our body of knowledge, our

culture, from the infidels.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#94:1> That's easy: we just watch everybody like a hawk, pouncing on anyone

who tries to steal from us.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#95:1> Our second function is more difficult; that is, we provide " routes"

for people to get at the information contained in our books and journal

articles.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#96:1> How do we do this?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#97:1> You know what browsing is, don't you?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#98:1> That's when you don't know what you want, but you know it when you

see it.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#99:1> We try to system <l> atize this process, take as much of the chance,

the intuition out as we pos <l> sibly can.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#100:1> Again, people must trust the library to classify, to group the books

properly.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#101:1> <quote> Oh ye of little faith </quote> ! " — and with that, she

brought her hand down on the desk with a crashing thud. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#102:1> My gaze shifted from her hand up to her eyes, which were pale

grey, behind heavy-framed glasses.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#103:1> I was often to see her take these glasses off, and put them in their

case, but only to put her other ones on, her glasses for reading.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#104:1> In those few seconds between taking off and putting on, I would look

carefully at her uncovered eyes, to see if they could function on their own —

did they have that sleepy, half-dazed look? — and I concluded they did.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#105:1> And when Miss Henchey led me out of her office, to introduce me to

the other members of the library staff, I took a good look at her skirt and

blouse — did they crackle when she moved?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#106:1> I concluded they did not, that Miss Henchey had very little energy,

was sickly and slow-moving. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#107:1> The library was composed of three sections: the work area behind

a long counter where the students came to sign out books; a large, open area

filled with tables for studying; and the stacks where the books and journals

were shelved according to subject.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#108:1> Of these three areas, I knew at once I preferred the solitude of the

stacks.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#109:1> I like the peculiar smell pro <l> duced when many books are placed

together side by side, particularly when many of them are old and full of

mould.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#110:1> My other duties, serving students at the front desk, for example, I

accomplished as quickly as possi <l> ble so that I could return to the

stacks.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#111:1> Miss Henchey never complained, though she always said publicly that

the service component of our duties was the most vital.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#112:1> I realized she didn't believe it and that she was most at peace when

Miss Minsky and myself stayed in the stacks as long as possi <l> ble, making

sure the books were in their proper sequence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#113:1> As it was nearly summer, Miss Henchey went around personally

each morning flinging open all the windows, then she would retreat to her

office to rest.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#114:1> These windows were large, with ample inside encasements for one to

stretch out one's legs, lean back, read, or even nap — all of this behind the

protective wall of a thick, velvet curtain.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#115:1> Some of these win <l> dows overlooked a seldom used courtyard.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#116:1> The shrubs and small trees planted around its perimeter had never

been pruned.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#117:1> Very little light got through anymore, yet time and time again,

whenever Miss Henchey found one of the curtains had been left open, she would

warn us about ultraviolet rays.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#118:1> Behind these curtained walls, no one disturbed me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#119:1> I could read or do nothing at all except listen to the insects

buzzing among the leaves, each second bringing them closer and closer to

death's door.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#120:1> Occasionally, I would simply grab one in my hand, squishing it to

death to end its boredom.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#121:1> I tried different windows, but then I settled on just one — one that

afforded the possibility of escape — and I was much more relaxed in my

deception. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-006#122:1> In December, with money coming in on a regular basis, I felt

confident enough to buy a bed you could fold away during the day and forget

about.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#123:1> I would get up in the morning at eight o'clock sharp and fold away

the bed immediately.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#124:1> Then I would prepare my coffee and open a tin of food for my cat (

who, for some reason, never ate until I had left for work).
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#125:1> This went on for about a month.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#126:1> Then, after Christmas, I began to get out of the bed a few minutes

late – I would throw the bed into its daytime position inside the couch, feed

the cat in a less grand style ( that is, leaving the food in the tin), then

rush to work.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#127:1> The later I got up, the more I had to hurry to get everything done

and arrive at work at nine o'clock sharp.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#128:1> Something had to give.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#129:1> I decided to compromise with myself.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#130:1> I would leave bed as soon as the alarm went off, but I would set it

so that I arrived at work one or two minutes late.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#131:1> There was an enormous barrier for me in arriving late for work. </I>

<X>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#X132:1> I wanted to be sure I could be late and still retain my job.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#X133:1> The first day I tried it, I arrived only thirty seconds, forty-five

sec <l> onds late.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-006#X134:1> And I went straight to Miss Henchy to tell her I was sorry I was

late. </p> </X>
