<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-041#1:1:A> <&> tape starts mid sentence </&> and she was one of the early

women graduates from Trinity College in Toronto in eighteen eighty-eight <,>

at a time when male physicians were predicting that higher education for

women <,> weakened developing wombs <,,> and produced disorders such as

infertility <,> the inhibition of lactation in nursing mothers serious mental

disturbance and pelvic distortion presumably <,> from sitting too much <O>

crowd laughter </O> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#2:1:A> In eighteen ninety-one undaunted Clara Brett Martin presented a

formal petition to the Law Society of Upper Canada for admission as a student

at law
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#3:1:A> This is the first record we have in Canada written record I

emphasize that of a female applicant
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#4:1:A> Which is not to suggest that there weren't women before her who

desired to go and who may have made informal enquiries
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#5:1:A> This is our first written record
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#6:1:A> The benchers of the Law Society rejected her application in the

first of what would be a series of Law Society votes against her admission
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#7:1:A> The Canada Law Journal put it succinctly
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#8:1:A> <O> quotation </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#9:1:A> It would take two separate statutes of the provincial parliament <,>

lobby forces mounted by very very prominent women in the community such as

Emily Stowe the first white woman doctor <,> and Lady Aberdeen the wife of

the Governor General and the founder of the National Council of Women of

Canada and six more years before Clara Brett Martin would finally achieve

success
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#10:1:A> During her articling experience she was described by fellow

students as <,> a very odd sort of woman <,> a rebel <,> and in later years

as a queer old duck
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#11:1:A> She survived taunting hissing and classroom sexual harassment

equivalent to that experienced by Emily Stowe one of the first women doctors
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#12:1:A> She also survived unprecedented media attention
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#13:1:A> Her first courtroom appearance was followed by a bevy of reporters

concerned above all with her appearance her voice inflection and her facial

tone
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#14:1:A> Now those of you <,> who've appeared in court for your first time

already will know what it's like to walk into a courtroom <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#15:1:A> Can you imagine walking into that courtroom as the first woman <,>

with a hoard of newspaper reporters at your toes
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#16:1:A> This is one of the reports that was written
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#17:1:A> <O> quotation </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#18:1:A> Clara Brett Martin went on to develop a successful practice

centring upon wills real estate and family law
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#19:1:A> Women lawyers howl with laughter when they hear this because that's

still where women practice <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#20:1:A> She rarely went to court
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#21:1:A> One is not surprised <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#22:1:A> She hired a number of female articling students
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#23:1:A> She gave <}> <-> <.> fre </.> </-> <=> frequent </=> </}> lectures

to women's organizations on issues of women and law
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#24:1:A> She wrote extensively for the National Council of Women of Canada

criticizing the paternal rights in child custody the double standard of

sexuality in law and the legal disabilities of married women
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#25:1:A> She lobbied for female suffrage and for separate women's courts
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#26:1:A> She was elected as a school trustee and she ran for the position of

alderman in nineteen twenty <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#27:1:A> She died in nineteen twenty-three at the relatively young age of

forty-nine of a heart attack <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#28:1:A> Now within the past year and a half we have had a monumental

discovery because until this time all efforts to trace Clara Brett Marin's

diaries journals correspondence personal and business files have failed
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#29:1:A> However within the past year and a half a P H D History student

named Peter Sibenik who was researching files in the archives of the Ontario

Attorney General going through countless letters received by the Ontario

Attorney General in the early twentieth century came across a letter from

Clara Brett Martin
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#30:1:A> Now this is one of the only surviving letters remaining from Clara

Brett Martin's practice
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#31:1:A> And this letter indicates that Clara Brett Martin may have been a

proponent of sex equality but she was also capable of fairly ugly forms of

discrimination
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#32:1:A> The letter she wrote in nineteen fifteen to the Ontario Attorney

General accused Jewish realtors of transferring <}> <-> proper title </-> <=>

property titles </=> </}> improperly <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#33:1:A> I'm going to quote two or three lines of this
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#34:1:A> Anybody who'd like to look at the full letter I have ah the full

contents of it with me which you can see after
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#35:1:A> But the lines which capture the flavour went as follows
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#36:1:A> <O> quotation </O> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#37:1:A> Now this is one letter <,> and one of the first <,> questions that

I'd been asked when I'm making <,> this speech is <,> can we make any

assessments on the basis of one letter
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#38:1:A> And I think that's a difficult question to answer
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#39:1:A> I think that it is safe to say that on the basis of this one letter

we can make an assessment that Clara Brett Martin was anti-Semitic <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#40:1:A> On the other hand <,> this past week <,> I received a

correspondence from <@> Gladys Kroech </@> from the University of Toronto

which suggests that it is difficult to be conclusive in the face of one

letter
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#41:1:A> And I'd like to read to you from a letter which she sent me written

to her by <@> Robert Gordon </@> and dated November twenty-eighth nineteen

ninety <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#42:1:A> <}> <-> It writes </-> <=> He writes </=> </}> <quote> I have been

reading with some interest recent reports of Clara Brett Martin and certain

anti-Semitic remarks which she reportedly made </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#43:1:A> <O> quote continues </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#44:1:A> Now <,> we got first late-breaking news about a Jewish legal

secretary and bookkeeper <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#45:1:A> Now I think that alters our record somewhat <,> but not completely
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#46:1:A> I don't think <,> memories positive memories from a Jewish

secretary and bookkeeper are going to completely override a clearly expressed

form of anti-Semitism in a nineteen fifteen letter but I think it signals <,>

very importantly to us that matters of discimination are complicated <,> and

that people are not all one or the other
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#47:1:A> None of us is free from discrimination and none of us is completely

malevolent and I think that sets the context for my remarks today <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#48:1:A> Canadian society and the legal profession was riddled with

anti-Semitism throughout the nineteenth century and the early twentieth

century
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#49:1:A> In the first decade of the nineteenth century Ezekiel Hart a

merchant from the small Jewish community in Trois-Rivi&egrave;res was elected

twice to represent his riding in the Quebec Legislative Assembly
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#50:1:A> Both times he was declared ineligible to sit because he was a Jew
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#51:1:A> Interestingly it was one of his <}> <-> <.> m </.> </-> <=> family

</=> </}> members a descendant of Ezekiel Hart who became the first Jewish

lawyer called to the bar in the two Canadas <&> reference to Upper and Lower

Canada </&> some years later <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#52:1:A> By the eighteen eighties and nineties pogroms in Russia and Romania

caused several thousand Jews to immigrate to Canada and incidents of bigotry

began to increase
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#53:1:A> Goldwin Smith who in the nineteenth century was the darling of the

Canadian intelligentsia was characterized as an arch Jew-bater and bitter

anti-Semite by the Jewish Times
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#54:1:A> Writing in eighteen eighty Smith proclaimed that Jews were an

abhorrent tribe anti-social and immoral
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#55:1:A> Henri Bourassa the French Canadian parliamentarian defended the

Russian pogroms of nineteen oh five arguing that Jews brought it on

themselves through deception and exploitation
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#56:1:A> In nineteen hundred the Toronto Weekly Sun clamoured to prohibit

immigration of Polish Jews
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#57:1:A> <quote> No invasion could be worse </quote> it wrote claiming that

Polish Jews were corruptors of the community
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#58:1:A> In nineteen oh four the Ottawa Free Press protested the immigration

of Russian Jews a group it described as having <quote> drained the miserable

purses of careless Russian peasants through usury and extortion </quote> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#59:1:A> In the nineteen twenties and thirties vast sectors of the economy

were completely closed to Jews
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#60:1:A> Banks insurance companies department stores universities and large

industrial corporations refused to hire Jews
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#61:1:A> There were no Jewish judges <,> and most law firms <,> also refused

to hire Jewish members
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#62:1:A> <?> Bora Laskin </?> could not find a job in nineteen thirty-seven

when he returned to Toronto from Harvard Law School
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#63:1:A> A brilliant legal scholar with two Master's degrees to his credit

he was consigned to write head notes for a law publisher at fifty cents a

note <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#64:1:A> Now the question you're going to be asking yourself is <,> is

historical context an excuse
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#65:1:A> Does it excuse Clara Brett Martin's letter to know that she was

surrounded by anti-Semitic rhetoric and bigotry <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#66:1:A> Is it possible to argue she was merely a product of racist

discriminatory intolerant times
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#67:1:A> Now the typical historical answer to this is yes <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#68:1:A> My answer is no <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#69:1:A> Class discrimination <,> anti-Semitism racism ableism heterosexism

and other forms of bias have made the lives of many members of oppressed

groups an unmitigated hell
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#70:1:A> Clara Brett Martin must have known that and if she didn't she

should have <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#71:1:A> Throughout these years in addition to the bigots there were people

battling discrimination
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#72:1:A> Jews and other religious minority groups were demanding freedom of

religion and an end to religious racial and ethnic bigotry
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#73:1:A> There were choices to be made <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#74:1:A> Clara Brett Martin chose to perpetrate some of the abuses not fight

<?> them </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#75:1:A> To modernize <,> her choices must be viewed as tragic
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#76:1:A> A woman of such insight who fought so valiantly against the forces

of oppression in many aspects of her life who paid the price of ostracism

ridicule and undisguised hostility for her work reveals herself as partially

riddled with bias in some other aspects of her beliefs and practices <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#77:1:A> Now to move to a modern perspective the present debate seems to

focus on how we today in contemporary times should respond to information

revealing tragic deficiencies in insight of the famous heroines of the past
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#78:1:A> And I think the importance of this question cannot be

overemphasized <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#79:1:A> And I offer my remarks today as the preliminary <,> beginnings of

what must necessarily be a full and lengthy debate <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#80:1:A> I also want to speak briefly about my own status in offering these

remarks as a non-Jew <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#81:1:A> To some degree my situation today reflecting on Clara Brett

Martin's anti-Semitism reminds me of a situation of a man who comes to

address an audience on how to tackle difficult issues relating to the

oppression of women
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#82:1:A> We've had a lot of debate in Canada over the last number of months

<,> on the concept of appropriation of voice <,> and who should speak <,> on

these issues
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#83:1:A> And I must say I side squarely with the group that is worried about

appropriation of voice in that <,> scholars researchers <,> advocates who do

not speak from personal experience make mistakes <,> and I believe that <,>

Jewish women in fact should take the lead in this debate as individuals who

have much deeper insight into anti-Semitism and its meaning than anything

that Gentiles can offer
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#84:1:A> However many Jewish people have suggested to me that it is not

enough for us to sit back and let them take the lead on these debates that

indeed they want to hear our voices <,> in this matter
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#85:1:A> And so I'm going to speak <,> thinking I have some <}> <-> <.> impo

</.> </-> <=> important </=> </}> points to offer <,> and knowing that I'm

taking the risk of missing essential elements in the argument and hoping that

if I do <,> Jewish feminists will respond and we will all learn more <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#86:1:A> And I want to talk squarely about the concept of a heroine today

<,> because I think the question we're grappling is what meaning significance

and symbolism should we accord to women of the past <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#87:1:A> And it's very well captured to my mind in the label <mention>

heroine </mention>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#88:1:A> Are these women heroines or not <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#89:1:A> And this question is going to expand well beyond Clara Brett Martin

as more historical evidence comes to the fore <,> about Nellie McClung's

activity <,,> siding with the uh committee of citizens the one thousand

citizens that attempted to strike break during the Winnipeg General Strike

<&> reference to the Citizens' Committee of 1000 </&> as more evidence of

Emily Stowe the first white woman doctor's class insensitivities come to the

fore
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#90:1:A> Ya I mean even uh one of the most famous women from Quebec history

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#91:1:A> I'm <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> forget her name
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#92:1:A> Marguerite <,,> Bourgeoys <,> uh turns out to have been an active

slave holder and uh marketer in slaves <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#93:1:A> I think that <,> as our society struggles towards a greater

sensitivity to class and race and gender disparities we're going to learn

more about the mistakes of women we have cast as heroines <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#94:1:A> The search for heroines embodies an individualized history <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#95:1:A> For many of us history comes alive through people through the faces

of individuals who have striven for change who've suffered who've triumphed

and sometimes even failed abjectly in their efforts to improve the society

around them <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#96:1:A> Dictionary definitions of <mention> heroine </mention> however are

highly problematic
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#97:1:A> I began with my Oxford dictionary <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#98:1:A> The Oxford dictionary cites <mention> heroine </mention> and refers

you to <mention> heroic </mention>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-041#99:1:A> <mention> Heroic </mention> refers you to <mention> hero </mention>

<,,> and <mention> hero </mention> <,> is a largely male-centred concept </I>
