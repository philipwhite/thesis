<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-068#1:2:A> <@> Sarah </@> said she screamed and yelled <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#2:2:A> Both <@> Roger </@> and <@> Peter </@> attempted to have oral sex

with her <,> and <?> of course </?> she refused <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#3:2:A> She said <,> when she was having intercourse with <@> Roger </@> <@>

Peter </@> on one occasion had anal intercourse with her <unclear> one or two

words </unclear> time
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#4:2:A> Later when she was on top of <@> Roger </@> someone was holding her

<?> hips </?> <&> could be head </&> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#5:2:A> <@> Sarah </@> said she scratched <,> <@> Roger </@> 's back <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#6:2:A> When <@> Roger </@> was on top of her <@> Peter </@> then <,> said

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#7:2:A> I'm sorry <@> Sarah </@> said she scratched <,> his back when <@>

Roger </@> was on top of her <,> <unclear> three or four words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#8:2:A> <@> Peter </@> also <,> according to her testimony <,> said that

<quote> You've screwed her up now </quote> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#9:2:A> And <@> Sarah </@> also said that she felt pain
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#10:2:A> Pain in her vagina <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#11:2:A> During <@> Sarah </@> 's testimony she stated that when she was on

the bed <,> although <@> Roger </@> was kissing her she did not kiss him back

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#12:2:A> However in cross-examination <,> she conceded that at <,>

preliminary enquiry she said that she consentually kissed <@> Roger </@> <,>

while they were on the bed <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#13:2:A> She further testified that her answers at the preliminary <,>

hearing <,> were true <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#14:2:A> It was also brought out in the cross-examination that when she <,>

was in the bedroom <,> she admitted her memory was hazy <,> and that she

blacked out from time to time <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#15:2:A> <@> Sarah </@> also stated that the accused <@> Matthew </@> came

into the bedroom <,> and on one occasion pulled her <?> legs </?> <,> apart
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#16:2:A> In cross-examination she said on one occasion she thought it was

<@> Matthew </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#17:2:A> On another occasion she said <quote> he tried to grab my <?> legs

</?> and force them apart <,> but I wouldn't <,> let him </quote> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#18:2:A> Again in cross-examination she again stated that she screamed and

yelled and demanded that <,> <@> Roger </@> <,> get off her and <,> leave her

<,> alone <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#19:2:A> Doctor <,> <@> Sandra <,> Grey </@> <,> was the first <,> Crown

witness <unclear> three or four words </unclear> <,> in my <,> opening

remarks <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#20:2:A> She is <?> a </?> family practioner in the city of <@> Salem </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#21:2:A> <?> She's </?> presently on medical leave and is <,> in residency

in <unclear> three or four words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#22:2:A> She said that she examined <@> Sarah </@> around eight P M on <@>

February the eighteenth </@> nineteen ninety- <unclear> word </unclear> in

the hospital in <,> <@> Salem </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#23:2:A> She said there were bruises <,> on the back of her left forearm and

on her right forearm <,> and her upper arm <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#24:2:A> Bruises were also located <?> in the hips </?> both knees and her

upper thighs and the crotch <,> area <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#25:2:A> She said she also had a significant abrasion of the bottom of the

vagina <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#26:2:A> This is the area she called the <mention> <unclear> word </unclear>

</mention> <,> and that the bottom of the vagina had bled
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#27:2:A> She also said the opening of her vagina <unclear> a few words

</unclear> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#28:2:A> In chief she said in her opinion <,> the injuries to the vaginal

area <,> were <,> consistent <,> with forceable entry into her vagina <,>

without that area being <,> lubricated
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#29:2:A> She also said that where there is sexual desire <,> there usually

<,> is lubrication
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#30:2:A> She also <,> testified <,> that she did not conduct a rectal

examination <?> as </?> <@> Sarah </@> did not mention <,> anal intercourse

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#31:2:A> She did confirm however that there was no trauma around the <,>

outside <}> <-> of the </-> <=> of the </=> </}> anus <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#32:2:A> <?> In <?> cross-examination she conceded that she did not have any

opinion <,> as to whether alcohol would have an effect on lubrication <?> in

the </?> vagina
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#33:2:A> She again confirmed that the abrasions in the vagina were

consistent with forceable <,> non-consenting <,> intercourse <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#34:2:A> She said if sexual desire is present in <unclear> word </unclear>

female <,> lubrication <,> is also present <,> in almost all situations <,>

especially in a young <,> healthy <,> woman <,> who recently has started her

period
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#35:2:A> She was also asked by <@> Miss Flynn </@> if <?> the </?> sexual

activity <,> started out with lubrication <,> and went on for a prolonged

period of time <,> would that cause <,> <}> <-> abrasion </-> <=> abrasions

</=> </}> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#36:2:A> Her answer was that she said normally <,> unless there was a long

delay <unclear> maybe a word </unclear> more than five to ten minutes <,> <?>

to </?> the point of ejaculation unless this occurred <,> this should not <,>

happen
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#37:2:A> She then said that because the initial lubrication <,,> provided by

the female gland is supplemented of course by the ejaculate
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#38:2:A> But then she did go on to say <unclear> word </unclear> summary <,>

she said that without <,> ejaculation <,> it might be possible <,> but highly

unusual in a very young woman who recently commenced <,> menstruating
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#39:2:A> <?> But really it was a <?> fairly <unclear> word </unclear>

detailed summary <}> <-> of of </-> <=> of </=> </}> <?> her evidence </?>

<unclear> word </unclear> <,> examination <unclear> a few words </unclear>

cross-examination
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#40:2:A> Now the accused <,> <@> Roger Rabbit </@> <,> testified on his own

behalf <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#41:2:A> He's now twenty-three years of age <,> he's employed with <@> City

Paving Solutions </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#42:2:A> He described the event that occurred on <@> February the

seventeenth </@> <,> and until he testified as to what happened in the

bedroom during the early hours of <@> February the eighteenth </@> <,> his

evidence is consistent with the other witnesses including <@> Sarah </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#43:2:A> During the party at <@> Moon Street </@> he described an incident

where <@> Sarah </@> appeared to freak out after <?> which <?> someone <?>

bumped her against a chair </?> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#44:2:A> He said she then hit the <?> fridge </?> in a <unclear> word

</unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#45:2:A> <@> Roger </@> said his consumption that evening included three

beers <,> four shots of Sambuca <,> and one to one and a half joints of

marijuana <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#46:2:A> After <@> Peter </@> had retired to his bedroom <@> Roger </@> said

he was looking for cigarettes <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#47:2:A> He went into <@> Peter </@> 's room <,> <@> Sarah </@> came with

him
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#48:2:A> After the door was closed he said <quote> we kissed and then I

undid my pants </quote> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#49:2:A> <@> Sarah </@> was on top of him and then <,> undid her pants after

<?> which <?> she took them off along with her <?> panties </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#50:2:A> <@> Peter </@> was on the bed and was asleep
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#51:2:A> After they French-kissed <,> she stayed on top of him <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#52:2:A> He inserted his penis in her vagina <,> and then began to make

passionate love
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#53:2:A> When they were having intercourse <@> Matthew </@> and <@> Juan

</@> <,> entered the room <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#54:2:A> They saw <@> Sarah </@> on top of him
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#55:2:A> After flicking the lights on and off <@> Matthew </@> enquired as

to where his dress pants were <unclear> one to three words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#56:2:A> After he retrieved his clothing he left the room and closed the

door <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#57:2:A> <@> Sarah </@> and <@> Roger </@> switched positions and continued

the sexual intercourse
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#58:2:A> <@> Peter </@> woke up and he appeared to be angry
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#59:2:A> Before <@> Sarah </@> left he said she gave him her name <,> and

phone number
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#60:2:A> He testified that <@> Sarah </@> did not say or do anything which

would indicate that she was not <,> a willing <,> participant in their sexual

<unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#61:2:A> He also denied that <@> Peter </@> had anal intercourse <,> with

her
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#62:2:A> <unclear> word </unclear> cross-examination <@> Roger </@> said

that they had sex for about twenty minutes <,> and that he had ejaculated <,>

in his hand <,> <unclear> multiple words </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#63:2:A> The next witness was the accused <@> Peter Dunstan </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#64:2:A> He is now twenty-four years of age <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#65:2:A> He lives with his mother in <@> Salem </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#66:2:A> And since <unclear> word </unclear> he's been working with

<unclear> word </unclear> <,> a <?> native </?> <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#67:2:A> He and his girlfriend have a seven-month-old <,> child <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#68:2:A> His evidence was to the effect that when he returned from <@>

Streamers' </@> he was so intoxicated that he retired to his bedroom
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#69:2:A> He was awakened by <@> Sarah </@> and <@> Roger </@> having sex on

his bed
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#70:2:A> After he told them to leave he said <@> Sarah </@> <,> became angry

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#71:2:A> However he said that he <?> dressed </?> and then left the room
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#72:2:A> He denied that he had anal intercourse with <@> Sarah </@> <?> or

that he stated </?> he had fucked her up <,> the ass
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#73:2:A> When <@> Sarah </@> and <@> Roger </@> were having sex he said they

were both undressed <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#74:2:A> The last accused to testify was <@> Matthew Childs </@> aged

twenty-three <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#75:2:A> He's presently working at the <@> EasyShop </@> <,> <unclear> word

</unclear> <@> Salem </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#76:2:A> He was not a resident <?> at <?> <@> Moon Street </@> <,> and

therefore when he arrived at that residence <,> he had a change of clothes

including an extra pair of dress pants as he knew they were going out to <?>

the </?> bar later that evening
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#77:2:A> He said sometime during the evening he lent a pair of his pants to

<@> Roger </@> <,> as he had in turn given his jeans to <@> Sarah </@> <,> to

wear to the bar as she had torn <,> her skirt <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#78:2:A> After they left the bar around two A M he drove <@> Juan's </@> car

back to <@> Moon Street </@> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#79:2:A> As he was leaving he ascertained that <@> Sarah </@> had been

asleep in the back of <unclear> word </unclear> car
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#80:2:A> She said she wanted to return to the party
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#81:2:A> After their return to <@> Moon Street </@> <@> Matthew </@> some

time later wanted to retrieve his pants from <@> Peter </@> 's room
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#82:2:A> He entered his bedroom turned on the light <,> and observed <@>

Roger </@> and <@> Sarah </@> having sex <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#83:2:A> He said they were naked <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#84:2:A> <@> Sarah </@> was breathing hard <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#85:2:A> <@> Peter </@> was asleep on the bed
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#86:2:A> After enquiring as to where his pants were he obtained them from

the bed
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#87:2:A> He then turned off the light and left the room
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#88:2:A> He said he did not touch <@> Sarah </@> or pull her legs apart <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#89:2:A> When he left <@> Peter </@> was asleep <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#90:2:A> I want to deal with the <,> criminal record <,> of the accused
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#91:2:A> Only applying to one <,> witness or one accused and that would be

the accused <,> <@> Matthew </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#92:2:A> Now he gave evidence and I think quite properly brought it out on

his own accord <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#93:2:A> He was asked whether <,> he'd ever been convicted of a criminal

offence
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#94:2:A> He replied that he had been convicted of <,> theft <,> in nineteen

ninety and received a fifty dollar fine
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#95:2:A> Now I have to give you some instructions as to what use if any that

you can <,> make of a criminal record <}> <-> in a </-> <=> in a </=> </}>

trial
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#96:2:A> This criminal record was introduced into evidence <,> not into

<unclear> word </unclear> only for the purpose of testing the credibility <,>

or <,> truthfulness <,> of the accused <,> as a witness <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#97:2:A> You may use the evidence of the criminal record when you consider

<,> his credibility
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#98:2:A> In order to decide whether a person with a criminal record of this

nature <,> is the kind of witness <?> who </?> might be believed <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#99:2:A> Please remember that a criminal record does not necessarily mean

that someone is a liar <,> in the same way that a clean record does not

necessarily mean that someone is truthful <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#100:2:A> When you examine <,> <@> Matthew </@> 's record <,> you should

consider <,> three things
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#101:2:A> First you should consider the nature of the offence <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#102:2:A> In particular you should consider whether <,> <@> Matthew </@> has

committed an offence that involved dishonesty <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#103:2:A> A conviction for an offence that involves dishonesty <,> obviously

has more bearing on credibility than a conviction for an offence <,> that

does not involve dishonesty <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#104:2:A> Two you should consider <,> when <,> <@> Matthew </@> <,>

committed the offence
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#105:2:A> A recent conviction may be more relevant to credibility than a

conviction for an offence that was committed a long time ago <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#106:2:A> Third you should consider <,> the number of convictions <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#107:2:A> A single conviction for a criminal offence is usually less serious

<,> than a long list of convictions
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#108:2:A> These three factors should help you to decide whether or not <,>

you will believe the accused's evidence
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#109:2:A> I should tell you however <,> that I do not think that this one

conviction <?> where <?> he received a fifty dollar fine <,> is <?>

significant </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#110:2:A> However please remember <,> that you are the judges of the facts

and you do not have to accept my opinion
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#111:2:A> It is important for you to understand that this previous

conviction <,> is not evidence <,> of <@> Matthew </@> 's guilt in this trial
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#112:2:A> You are not allowed to treat that conviction as evidence that he

is more likely <,> to commit <,> the offence with which he's charged
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#113:2:A> Also you are not allowed to treat his record as evidence that he

is more likely to commit criminal acts in general
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#114:2:A> The only reason <?> this </?> evidence of a criminal record was

admitted was for a very limited purpose
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#115:2:A> It's for the purpose of deciding whether or not you can believe

his testimony
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#116:2:A> And again <,> I've said it once I'll say it again I don't think in

this case that his criminal record <?> that one charge is very <?> <?>

significant </?> <,> <unclear> word </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#117:2:A> Now I'm now going to continue towards the end of my charge but I

will now deal with the case against each <?> of the accused </?> separately
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#118:2:A> <}> <-> I <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> deal <.> wi

</.> </-> <=> I'm <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> have to deal with

</=> </}> each <,> accused <,> separately <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#119:2:A> As to the charge against <@> Roger </@> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#120:2:A> If you <unclear> word </unclear> accept his testimony <unclear>

three or four words </unclear> and all the other evidence that was <unclear>

word </unclear> <,> and particularly the testimony that <@> Sarah </@>

consented to the act of intercourse <,> then you must return a verdict of not

guilty
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#121:2:A> Even if you do not accept the evidence <unclear> word </unclear>

for the defence that <@> Sarah </@> consented <,> but you are left with a

reasonable doubt <,> then you must also return a verdict of not guilty
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#122:2:A> Even if you are not left with a reasonable doubt <?> by <?> the

testimony <?> according to <?> <@> Roger </@> that <@> Sarah </@> consented

to have <?> sex with him </?> you must still go on to determine <,> whether

or not he is guilty
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#123:2:A> In other words you must be satisfied <,> that the Crown has proved

<,> each and every ingredient of the offence as I instructed you earlier <,>

<?> to sustain </?> the charge <,> beyond a reasonable doubt <unclear> two or

three words </unclear> guilty
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#124:2:A> But if you come to that conclusion of course then <unclear> four

or five words </unclear> guilty
<ICE-CAN:S2A-068#125:2:A> As I said earlier <,> I keep repeating <?> this as it's </?> so

important the Crown must establish the guilt of <@> Roger </@> beyond a

reasonable doubt </I>
