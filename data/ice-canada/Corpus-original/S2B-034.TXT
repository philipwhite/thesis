<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#1:1:A> It's been almost a decade since the Brundtland Commission made

its report in nineteen eighty-seven
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#2:1:A> Critics are beginning to wonder when all the talk will become action

on the ground
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#3:1:A> <@> Fred McSweeny </@> is with the Pembina Institute for Appropriate

Development in Drayton Valley

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#4:1:Z> <O> speech, 2 min 5 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#5:1:A> <@> Jim Bauer </@> of Alberta Environmental Protection is now

involved with a government review of the recommendations of the taskforce
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#6:1:A> The taskforce recommended some fairly progressive ideas such as the

use of full-cost accounting a review of fees and taxes for their effect on

sustainable development and that Alberta's system of protected areas be

completed

<$ZA> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#7:1:Z> <O> speech, 10 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#8:1:A> As is the case with things economic the federal government is

creating an independent auditor of sustainable development
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#9:1:A> In Alberta however there is no formal monitoring of our progress on

sustainable development
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#10:1:A> The Alberta Roundtable did come up with fifty-nine indicators for

measuring sustainable development but most of these indicators are not being

used in the government's annual report
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#11:1:A> The majority of indicators are still traditional measures of

economic performance such as G D P jobs and the cost of transportation
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#12:1:A> But that's only half of the sustainable development equation
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#13:1:A> What's missing are indicators that would raise red flags signalling

threats to the environment
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#14:1:A> I asked <@> Fred McSweeny </@> if there are indicators that could

help balance off the economic ones already in place

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#15:1:Z> <O> speech, 1 min 15 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#16:1:A> There's a flurry of sustainable development activity going on

inside government but it's hard to see results on the ground
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#17:1:A> This radio series was inspired by the Alberta Roundtable report
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#18:1:A> Throughout this series we will assess Alberta's progress on the

fifty-nine indicators of sustainable development identified by the Roundtable
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#19:1:A> That's it for our feature report </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#20:2:A> Technology may not hold all the answers to creating a

sustainable future but according to <@> Tim Lee </@> at A G T Limited the

creation of fibre optics has radically improved the efficiency of

telecommunications
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#21:2:A> Fibre optic wires are made out of plain everyday sand
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#22:2:A> Not only is the process of mining sand far cleaner than mining

copper the wires are one thousand times more efficient
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#23:2:A> This means one pair of fibre optic wires can handle thirty thousand

telephone calls at once <,> compared to just twenty-four on a pair of

old-fashioned copper wires
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#24:2:A> When it comes to Alberta's wetlands the story is not quite so

positive
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#25:2:A> According to Alberta Environmental Protection the number of

marshlands in Alberta declined by more than thirty percent between nineteen

seventy and nineteen ninety
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#26:2:A> To try and save wetlands the North American Waterfowl Management

Plan was created <,> and the Alberta government is also creating a wetland

policy for Alberta <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#27:2:A> Time will tell if the trend can be reversed <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#28:2:A> That's it for this week's Ecofacts and Trends

<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#30:3:A> Alberta's economy runs on natural resources
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#31:3:A> From the oil and gas industry to the coal-fired power plants that

provide our electricity Alberta's dependent on its natural resources
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#32:3:A> Agriculture forestry and tourism round off a suite of renewable

natural resources that Albertans depend on
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#33:3:A> How does a province of oil barons loggers miners and farmers deal

with some very real global environmental problems
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#34:3:A> Today we asked Ty Lund Alberta's Minister of the Environment what

Alberta's doing to create a sustainable future
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#35:3:A> In Alberta perhaps unlike anywhere else in Canada people are

reminded of their dependence on natural resources every two weeks when they

collect their paycheques
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#36:3:A> Most jobs in Alberta are linked in some way to the exploitation of

natural resources
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#37:3:A> Oil and gas still make up a majority of provincial revenues
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#38:3:A> Ty Lund knows this well
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#39:3:A> He's the Minister of the Environment and a two-term Conservative M

L A <&> Member of the Legislative Assembly </&> from Rocky Mountain House
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#40:3:A> I asked Ty Lund what he thinks the big sustainable development

issues are for Alberta

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#41:3:Z> <O> speech, 15 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#42:3:A> Lund's concerns about greenhouse gas emissions is tempered

however by his concern that Alberta might lose oil and gas business
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#43:3:A> In fact he says if Alberta reduced production of natural gas it

might be bad for the environment because those markets would still be filled

by other countries with lower environmental standards

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#44:3:Z> <O> speech, 2 min </O> <O> interview between A and Z, 1 min 40

sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#45:3:A> The government's annual report is chock full of economic

indicators such as the amount of grain produced timber harvested or the low

prices Alberta charges for utilities and trucking <,> but rarely does it look

at the quality and sustainability of the ecological systems that produce the

resources
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#46:3:A> The report of the Alberta Roundtable endorsed by the Alberta

government in nineteen ninety-three states there are consumption limits to

the Earth's resources and that the increasing rate of consumption and the

exploding world population are the largest contributors to the global

environmental crisis
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#47:3:A> I asked Ty Lund if he believes there are limits to consumption

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#48:3:Z> <O> speech, 20 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#49:3:A> Some scientists say we're already running a global

environmental deficit but the division between those who think vigorous

economic growth can save us and those who think reduced consumption can save

us is the Grand Canyon of voids
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#50:3:A> In March nineteen ninety-five the Ensuring Prosperity taskforce

made twenty-four recommendations to change our ways
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#51:3:A> Among many suggestions it proposed the injection of sustainable

development into the school curriculum and the creation of a mechanism to

coordinate and implement sustainable development
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#52:3:A> I asked Mister Lund if all of the recommendations are being

implemented

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#53:3:Z> <O> speech, 20 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#54:3:A> Many critics see monitoring and reporting on sustainable

development progress as the Achilles heel of sustainable development
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#55:3:A> They say that without transparent and independent monitoring it

will be too easy to cook the books
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#56:3:A> If sustainable development is as important as the government says

it is critics wonder why no one is in charge of it
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#57:3:A> The federal government is creating an independent environmental

auditor like the Auditor General
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#58:3:A> I asked Mister Lund if he's developing a similar process here

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#59:3:Z> <O> speech, 30 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#60:3:A> Another suggestion of the taskforce was a review of taxes and

fees for their impact on sustainable development
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#61:3:A> In Sweden the government there has recently reduced income tax by

four percent and replaced it with environmental taxes on S O two and C O two

gases related to acid deposition and global warming

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#62:3:Z> <O> speech, 15 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#63:3:A> For reaction to Ty Lund's ideas about sustainable development

we contacted <@> Ryan Polansky </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#64:3:A> He was a member of the Alberta Roundtable on the Environment and

Economy

<$ZA> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#65:3:Z> <O> speech, 55 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#66:3:A> In a natural resource dependent province like Alberta

sustainable development may be one of the most challenging issues we will

face in coming years
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#67:3:A> Next week we begin our exploration of the Alberta Roundtable's

fifty-nine indicators of sustainable development
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#68:3:A> That's it for our feature report
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#69:3:A> You're listening to the Chevron Ecofile </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#70:4:A> Preserving biodiversity is a key element of sustainable

development but have you ever wondered how many species of life there are in

Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#71:4:A> According to Ted Mosquin Don McAllister and Peter Whiting the

authors of a new book on Canada's biodiversity there are seventy-one thousand

species of life in Canada <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#72:4:A> But those are only the discovered species
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#73:4:A> The scientists estimate there are sixty-eight thousand more species

not yet discovered by science <,> and for each species of life there is at

least one more species of virus
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#74:4:A> If you're keeping tabs the answer is <,> there are two hundred

eighty thousand species of life in Canada <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#75:4:A> When you factor environmental costs into things the results can be

surprising
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#76:4:A> According to the World Watch Institute burning a gallon of gasoline

in the U S costs the driver about one dollar twenty cents but it can cost the

country another three dollars in medical bills and property damage from smog

and other side effects <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#77:4:A> That's it for this week's Ecofacts and Trends

<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#79:5:A> It's nine A M on a hot summer day
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#80:5:A> The morning rush hour is over and there's a yellow brownish haze

hanging over the city
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#81:5:A> <@> Todd Matlock </@> is an air quality analyst with Alberta

Environmental Protection

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#82:5:Z> <O> speech, 1 min 5 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#83:5:A> If that day were a fall day and there was a strong temperature

inversion you might be experiencing one of Alberta's rare <,> poor air

quality days
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#84:5:A> Today we'll try to find out whether air quality is getting better

or worse in Alberta <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#85:5:A> According to <@> Jimmy Siegel </@> of Alberta's Air Monitoring

Branch urban air quality is improving in Alberta

<$ZA> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#86:5:Z> <O> speech, 20 sec </O> <O> interview between A and ZA, 20

sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#87:5:A> Alberta's air quality index reports on the status of five

major pollutants carbon monoxide dust and smoke nitrogen dioxide ozone and

sulphur dioxide
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#88:5:A> The air quality index rates air quality in seven cities and towns

as good fair poor or very poor
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#89:5:A> <@> Jimmy Siegel </@> is with Alberta's Air Monitoring Branch

<$ZA> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#90:5:Z> <O> speech, 20 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#91:5:A> You can find out the current air quality index by calling <@>

four one seven seven one seven nine </@> in Edmonton and <@> two five seven

two seven one one </@> in Calgary
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#92:5:A> The picture painted by Alberta's Air Monitoring Branch is actually

quite rosy
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#93:5:A> Dozens of slick brochures itemize dramatic improvements in a number

of areas
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#94:5:A> But according to <@> Deborah Kostiuk </@> an environmentalist from

Rocky Mountain House there are some problems
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#95:5:A> <@> Kostiuk </@> worries that carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide

emissions are rising and that monitoring in rural Alberta is inadequate
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#96:5:A> She's also worried about high ground level ozone levels in rural

areas and the emerging issue of acid aerosols pollutants that form when acids

in the air combine with fine particulates
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#97:5:A> In nineteen ninety the government released the Clean Air Strategy

for Alberta
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#98:5:A> It presented a comprehensive new blueprint for air quality

management in Alberta
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#99:5:A> Soon after the Clean Air Strategic Alliance or CASA was formed
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#100:5:A> It's up to CASA to implement the Clean Air Strategy
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#101:5:A> <@> Tim Feely </@> is the executive director of CASA

<$ZB> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#102:5:Z> <O> speech, 1 min 55 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#103:5:A> One of the first airshed groups to form was the West Central

Airshed Society
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#104:5:A> <@> Tom Wilfred </@> of Weldwood Canada in Hinton is the group's

Chair

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#106:5:A> In the early nineteen eighties the unmistakable odour of

poisonous sour gas poured over the region when the Lodgepole sour gas well

blew
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#107:5:A> After that experience residents wanted better air quality

monitoring <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#108:5:A> The airshed covers an area that runs from the Berland River in the

north along the Alberta B C border to a line north of Rocky Mountain House

and east almost as far as Wabamun Lake
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#109:5:A> The monitoring will cost seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars

a year and will include biological monitoring sites where alfalfa saskatoons

and even forests will be monitored for the effects of air pollution

<$ZC> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#110:5:Z> <O> speech, 25 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#111:5:A> Some fifty companies now contribute to the airshed agency and

<@> Wilfred </@> says this should mean better monitoring and higher public

credibility

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#113:5:A> Since funding is provided on a polluter-pay basis it may be

possible for industry to reduce its levy

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#115:5:A> The Clean Air Strategic Alliance is working to get other

regional airshed groups started as well
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#116:5:A> That's it for our feature report
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#117:5:A> Next week we'll zero in on one of the most troubling pollutants of

all
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#118:5:A> One observer told us he hasn't seen a mobilization of industry

around an issue like this since Love Canal
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#119:5:A> You can't see it or smell it but increasing concentrations of

carbon dioxide could change the world you live in
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#120:5:A> We'll find out what Alberta's doing about global warming next week

</I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#121:6:A> Alberta is one of the leading producers of sulphur dioxide

pollution in Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#122:6:A> Sulphur dioxide is a key cause of acid rain or acid deposition
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#123:6:A> Second only to Ontario Alberta produces six hundred forty thousand

tonnes of S O two each year
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#124:6:A> Most of the S O two pollution comes from natural gas processing

the tar sands and power plants <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#125:6:A> Because of prevailing winds about seventy percent of Alberta's S O

two pollution is exported to other places <,> like Saskatchewan the Northwest

Territories and Ontario <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#126:6:A> According to one estimate Alberta is responsible for nine percent

of the acid deposition in northern Ontario <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#127:6:A> On the good news side of things some air quality trends in

Edmonton and Calgary are positive
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#128:6:A> Thanks to improving car technology carbon monoxide pollution is

down by more than fifty percent since nineteen eighty <,> and the use of

unleaded gasoline has helped reduce lead pollution by ninety-six percent over

the same period of time <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#129:6:A> That's it for this week's Ecofacts and Trends
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#130:6:A> I'm <@> Annie Gillis </@> </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-034#131:7:A> On one of those spring days when the thermometer drops below

minus twenty degrees Celsius it's just plain hard to take global warming

seriously <,> but according to researchers at the National Climatic Data

Center in Ashville New York you should
<ICE-CAN:S2B-034#132:7:A> They say there's as much as a ninety-five percent chance that

increasing weather extremes are being caused by greenhouse gases </I>
