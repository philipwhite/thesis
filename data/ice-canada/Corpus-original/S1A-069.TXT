<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#181:2:B> No <,> no actually

<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#183:2:B> Although every once in a while I just <,,> think of the two of

something inside of me wants to erupt

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#184:2:A> And then what happens

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#185:2:B> And then I go no <,,> don't buy into that
<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#186:2:B> Don't go off on that tangent
<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#187:2:B> Just

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#188:2:A> You can do a mental image thing
<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#189:2:A> You can do like <}> <-> a a </-> <=> a </=> </}> crunch your hands

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#194:2:A> Ya

<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#199:2:A> The whole premise of it is behaviourism <}> <-> and </-> <=> and

</=> </}> it will
<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#200:2:A> You can't control your thoughts but you can can control <,,> the

you say <,> stop you can

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#204:2:B> Ya

<,,> find it <,> annoying
<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#206:2:B> No not annoying
<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#207:2:B> I find it really intensely hurtful <,,> still <,,> so

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#208:2:A> If you can stop looking at it as something that was done to

non-overt stuff
<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#215:2:B> The overt stuff was <,,> not directed at me <,> I guess

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#217:2:A> <[> Well see </[> </{> it makes sense for you to interpret it

that way in a lot of ways because <,> all of your actions were being guided

the effect it would have on <,> <@> Gary </@>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#218:2:B> Ya <,,> ya
<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#219:2:B> So <,,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#220:2:A> So it would make sense that you would think that his actions

would be

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#221:2:B> Mhh hmm <?>

<$B> </?>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#222:2:B> Well it was interesting I had

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#223:2:B> Why did <@> Anne </@> quit work

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#224:2:A> I don't know

<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#232:2:A> I have no idea <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#233:2:A> I can't see that she would have felt <,,> weird about uh <,,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#234:2:B> <}> <-> I mean I hope </-> <=> I mean <@> Tia </@> has to

you're not pleased with her and <,> <{> <[> a whole bunch of people are </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#235:2:A> <[> Oh I don't think she cares </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#236:2:A> Why would she care

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#237:2:B> Cos <}> <-> I think she <}> <-> sorta </-> <+> sort of </+>

</}> felt that we all had sort of that there was </-> <=> I don't know I

think because </=> </}> she thought there was some basis in <,> a friendship

<,,> with us all or something
<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#238:2:B> But it was really interesting cos <@> Gerry Folsom </@> when I

worked with him on the other day he said oh I saw <@> Tia </@> and <@> Gary

</@> at the Black Tomato <,> <{> <[> and I went </[> oh ya

<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#247:2:B> He said that's just low

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#255:2:B> <[> Ya
<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#256:2:B> So </[> </{> <,> but he said that when he walked in he looked

around cos he was looking for a friend and then he turned around and saw <@>

Tia </@> and <@> Gary </@> <,> and <@> Tia </@> was trying to sort of hide
<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#257:2:B> She was just like trying not to make eye contact with him <,> but

of course he said I just went over and said hi and everything

know that's really interesting
<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#259:2:B> Obviously if she had that reaction <,> to seeing someone <,> who

she knew would be seeing me <{1> <[1> <,> </[1> who she knew knew her

im </.> </-> <=> you know the reaction </=> </}> I would have
<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#261:2:B> <{3> <[3> <,,> </[3> and have said something like well maybe <,>

you <@> Gary </@> should tell her <}> <->
<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#262:2:B> <{4> <[4> and </-> <=> <,,> </[4>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#263:2:B> <{5> <[5> and </[5> </=> </}> this should be dealt with

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#264:2:A> <[1> Ya </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#265:2:A> <[2> Ya </[2> </{2>

<ICE-CAN:S1A-069#269:2:A> Ya

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#270:2:B> Uhm and the other thing is when I found out <@> Gary </@> was

seeing someone new <,> uhm I said to him then <,,> since you and I are

maintaining a friendship although it's going to be a friendship that's <}>

<-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> take some time <,> and we're not you

maybe you know a while

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#271:2:A> Oh you guys had analysis-of-friendship discussions

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-069#272:2:B> <{> <[> <?> We </?> had one </[>
