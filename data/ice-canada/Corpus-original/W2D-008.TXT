<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#2:1> <h> <bold> 1 </bold> SUMMARY </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#3:1> <h> <bold> Part III of the <it> Canada Labour Code </it> ( Labour

Standards) </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#4:1> <h> <bold> <it> 1. Coverage </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#5:1> Part III of the <it> Canada Labour Code </it> ( Labour Standards)

and accompanying Regulations apply to employees and employers in works,

undertakings, or businesses under the legislative authority of the Parliament

of Canada. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#6:1> Broadly speaking, the activities that come within federal

jurisdiction include: <l> &bullet; Interprovincial and international services

such as <l> - railways; - highway transport; - telephone, telegraph, and

cable systems; - pipelines; - canals; - ferries, tunnels, and bridges; -

shipping and shipping services; &bullet; Radio and television broadcasting,

including cablevision; &bullet; Air transport, aircraft operations, and

aerodromes; &bullet; Banks; &bullet; Undertakings for the protection and

preservation of fisheries as a natural resource; &bullet; Undertakings

declared by Parliament to be for the general advantage of Canada such as <l>

- most grain elevators; - flour and seed mills, feed warehouses and

grain-seed cleaning plants; - uranium mining and processing; - certain

individual undertakings such as Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#7:1> Most federal Crown corporations, such as the Canada Mortgage and

Housing Corporation and Canada Post Corporation, are covered while federal

public service employees are not.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#8:1> The Government of Canada has stated, however, that the minimum

standards of the Code will be met in the public service as a matter of

policy. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#9:1> This is a general outline of the undertakings subject to Part III

of the <it> Canada Labour Code </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#10:1> If you are employed in or operate an undertaking other than described

above, you should contact your provincial or territorial labour department

for information relating to labour standards. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#11:1> <h> <bold> Managerial and Professional Employees </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#12:1> The hours-of-work provisions of the Code do not apply to

employees who are managers or superintendents or who exercise management

functions or to members of architectural, dental, engineering, legal, or

medical professions.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#13:1> Managers are also excluded from coverage under the unjust dismissal

provisions. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#14:1> <h> <bold> Part-time and Casual Employees </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#15:1> The Code makes no distinction between full-time and part-time or

casual employees.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#16:1> All are covered by its provisions if they meet the qualifying

requirements. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#17:1> <h> <bold> <it> 2. Standards </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#18:1> The primary objective of Part III of the <it> Canada Labour Code

</it> is to establish and protect the work place <w> partners' </w> right to

fair and equitable conditions of employment. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#19:1> Following are brief descriptions of the minimum standards

provided by the Code.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#20:1> For further detail, please refer to the pamphlets on individual

standards listed below. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#21:1> The Code provisions are minimum standards only and in no way

interfere with more favourable rights or benefits established by collective

agreement, private arrangement or employer policy.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#22:1> Further, unionized undertakings are exempt from the divisions of the

Code dealing with minimum wages, annual vacations, general holidays and

bereavement leave where the collective agreement provides rights and benefits

as favourable or better than those in the Code in respect of length of leave,

rates of pay and qualifying periods; and, the collective agreement provides

for the settlement of disputes by a third party. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#23:1> <h> <bold> Hours of Work </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#24:1> Standard hours are 8 in a day and 40 in a week.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#25:1> At least one and one-half times the regular rate of pay must be paid

for hours worked in excess of standard hours.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#26:1> Maximum hours are 48 in a week.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#27:1> Certain provisions permit flexibility in applying these standards.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#28:1> As well, special regulations cover certain classes of workers in

specific industries such as, for example, city and highway transport drivers.

</p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#29:1> <h> <bold> Minimum Wages </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#30:1> Minimum wage rates are explained in pamphlet 2 of this series,

available from any Human Resources Development Canada ( Labour Program)

office.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#31:1> These rates are subject to revision from time to time by

order-in-council. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#32:1> <h> <bold> Annual Vacations <bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#33:1> An employee is entitled to at least 2 weeks vacation annually

with vacation pay of not less than 4 per cent of gross wages.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#34:1> After 6 consecutive years of employment with one employer, an

employee is entitled to 3 weeks vacation with pay, equivalent to 6 per cent

of gross earnings. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#35:1> Vacation must be granted not later than 10 months after

completion of the year entitling the employee to the vacation.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#36:1> Any outstanding vacation pay must be paid on termination of

employment. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#37:1> <h> <bold> General Holidays </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#38:1> Employees are entitled to nine holidays with pay each year: New

Year's Day, Good Friday, Victoria Day, Canada Day, Labour Day, Thanksgiving

Day, Remembrance Day, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#39:1> Provision is made for the substitution of other holidays where so

designated in collective agreements or where the employer and at least 70 per

cent of employees agree to the substitution.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#40:1> When an employee, who would have been entitled to a general holiday

with pay, is required to work on a general holiday, the employee will be

paid, in addition to his regular rate of wages for that day, at a rate at

least equal to one and one-half times his regular rate of wages for the time

the employee worked on that day.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#41:1> Special provisions apply to workers in " continuous operations" and

to managerial and professional employees ( see pamphlet 4 in this series).

</p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#42:1> <h> <bold> Maternity-Related Reassignment and Leave, Maternity Leave

and Parental Leave </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#43:1> An employee who is pregnant or nursing may request that the

employer temporarily modify her job duties or reassign her to another job,

where reasonably practicable, if continuing any of her current duties may

pose a risk to her health or that of the f&oeligature;tus or child.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#44:1> A physician's certificate indicating how long the risk is likely to

last and what activities or conditions should be avoided, is required. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#45:1> An employee who has worked for the same employer for at least 6

months is entitled to up to 17 weeks of maternity leave to have her child.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#46:1> The employer may not compel an employee to take leave unless she is

unable to perform an essential function of her job and no appropriate

alternative job is available. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#47:1> An additional leave of up to 24 weeks is available to natural or

adoptive parents each of whom have worked for the same employer for at least

6 months and have or will have care and custody of a child.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#48:1> If both parents work for federally regulated employers, their

combined leave cannot exceed 24 weeks. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#49:1> An employer may not dismiss, suspend, lay off, demote, or

discipline an employee because she is pregnant or has applied for leave.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#50:1> Pregnancy or intention to take related leave cannot affect an

employer's decision to train or promote her. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#51:1> Upon their written request, employees on leave are entitled to be

informed of any employment, promotion, or training opportunities for which

they are qualified. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#52:1> The Code also provides that seniority continue and pension,

health, and disability plans remain in force during leave, provided the

employee pays normally required contributions.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#53:1> The employer must continue payments to such plans in at least the

same proportion as if the employee were at work.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#54:1> If there is an income replacement or insurance plan in force at the

work place, an employee on leave is entitled to benefits on the same terms as

any employee absent from work for health-related reasons. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#55:1> Upon return from leave, the employee must be reinstated in his or

her position or be given a comparable position in the same work place with

the same wages and benefits.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#56:1> However, an employee's wages and benefits may be affected if, during

the leave, the wages and benefits of the employee's group are changed as part

of a plan to reorganize the work place. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#57:1> For further details and conditions concerning parental leave, see

pamphlet 5 of this series. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#58:1> <h> <bold> Termination of Employment </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#59:1> Employers are required to give individual employees two weeks

written notice of termination, or two <w> weeks' </w> pay in lieu of notice,

except where the employee is dismissed for just cause.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#60:1> Employees must have been continuously employed for at least three

months to qualify for notice or pay in lieu. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#61:1> If an employer intends to terminate the employment of 50 or more

employees in an industrial establishment within any 4-week period, at least

16 weeks advance notice must be given in writing to the Minister of Labour,

the Canada Employment and Immigration Commission, and any trade union

recognized as the bargaining agent for affected employees. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#62:1> Where there is no bargaining agent, notice must be given directly

to the employees. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#63:1> In addition, an employer who gives notice of a group termination

is required to establish a committee of employer and employee representatives

for the purposes of developing an adjustment plan to reduce the impact of the

termination upon the affected employees. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#64:1> <h> <bold> Severance Pay </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#65:1> Employees with at least 12 consecutive months of service are

entitled to severance pay on termination, except in cases of dismissal for

just cause.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#66:1> The amount of entitlement is the greater of two <w> days' </w> pay

for each completed year of service or five <w> days' </w> pay. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#67:1> <h> <bold> Payment of Wages </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#68:1> Employers are required to pay employees on the regular pay-day as

established by the employer's practice and to pay any wages or other amounts

such as overtime pay, holiday pay, severance pay, or bereavement pay within

30 days of entitlement. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#69:1> <h> <bold> Wage Recovery </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#70:1> The Code provides an administrative procedure for collecting

unpaid wages and other benefits.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#71:1> If an employer has not paid an employee wages or other amounts to

which the employee is entitled, a written payment order may be issued by a

federal inspector to the employer or, under certain circumstances, to a

director of the corporation, ordering payment of the amount in question.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#72:1> A person affected by a payment order may appeal to the Minister, in

writing, within 15 days after service of the order.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#73:1> An employer or director may file an appeal only if the amount

indicated in the payment order is paid to the Minister.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#74:1> Should the federal inspector conclude that the employee's complaint

is without merit, a notice of unfounded complaint is issued.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#75:1> The employee may appeal to the Minister in writing within 15 days

after service of the notice. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#76:1> <h> <bold> Garnishment of Wages </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#77:1> An employee may not be disciplined because garnishment

proceedings may be or have been taken against him or her. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#78:1> <h> <bold> Deductions from Wages </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#79:1> An employer may not make deductions from wages or other amounts

due to an employee unless the deduction is required by federal or provincial

law, authorized by a court order or collective agreement, or where the

deduction is related to amounts authorized in writing by an employee, or

overpayment of wages by the employer.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#80:1> An employer may not make deductions in respect of damage to property

or loss of money or property if any person other than the employee had access

to the property or money in question. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#81:1> <h> <bold> Sick Leave Protection </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#82:1> An employee who has 3 or more months of continuous employment may

not be disciplined, demoted, laid off, suspended, or dismissed because of

absence due to illness or injury, provided the absence does not exceed 12

weeks and the employee, if requested in writing by the employer, provides the

employer with a doctor's certificate certifying that the employee was not

able to work during that period.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#83:1> Seniority accumulates and pension and benefit plans continue in force

during the absence provided the employee pays any normally required

contributions.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#84:1> The employer is not required to continue wage payments during sick

leave but must maintain contributions to health and disability benefit plans

in at least the same proportion as if the employee were at work. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#85:1> <h> <bold> Injured Worker Protection </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#86:1> Employees are protected from dismissal, suspension, lay-off,

demotion, or discipline because of absence from work due to work-related

illness or injury.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#87:1> During such absences, employees are entitled to wage replacement,

payable at an equivalent rate to that provided for under applicable <w>

workers' </w> compensation legislation in the employee's province of

permanent residence. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#88:1> <h> <bold> Bereavement Leave </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#89:1> All employees are entitled to bereavement leave on any normal

working day that occurs during the three days immediately following the death

of a member of their immediate family.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#90:1> Employees with three or more months of service are entitled to be

paid for such leave days. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-008#91:1> <h> <bold> Unjust Dismissal </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-008#92:1> After 12 consecutive months of employment, employees who are not

managers or subject to a collective agreement and believe they have been

unjustly dismissed may lodge a written complaint of unjust dismissal with the

department. </p> </I>
