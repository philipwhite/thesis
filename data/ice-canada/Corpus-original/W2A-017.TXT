<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#1:1> <h> Introduction </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-017#2:1> In 1984 Shirley Ittas, a faculty secretary in the film department

at York University in Toronto, worked a 35-hour week for

$15,745 per year.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#3:1> Shirley's job requirements were many and complex: <l> <X> <quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#X4:1> she uses her judgement as well as her clerical skills.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#X5:1> There are many hectic days when students need quick responses.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#X6:1> In fielding in <l> quiries, providing information about the

department's regulations and courses, sorting out hundreds of portfolios and

grades for evaluation, she believes she affects student's lives. </quote>

</X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-017#7:1> Shirley was paid

$8.65 per hour.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#8:1> The groundskeepers at York were getting

$9.19 per hour.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#9:1> Was Shirley being paid fairly in com <l> parison with the

groundskeepers?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#10:1> She certainly didn't think so: <l> <X> <quote> '
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#X11:1> I didn't feel angry that they [ the groundskeepers] were earning a

certain amount of money.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#X12:1> I felt angry I was paid less.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#X13:1> I do have a lot of responsibility and I think my contribution is as

valuable as their contribution, and my salary should be at least equal ....
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#X14:1> My job is important.' </quote> <fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr> </X> </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#15:1> <h> <bold> PURPOSE </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-017#16:1> Investigation into the income differences between women and men

has been dominated by three types of studies: quantitative estimations by

economists and sociologists of the components of the gendered wage gap; <fnr>

<sp> 2 </sp> </fnr> estimations of the actual or expected economic and

employment effects of equal-pay legislation; <fnr> <sp> 3 </sp> </fnr> and

legal analyses of the grounds for litigation ever unequal pay. <fnr> <sp> 4

</sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#17:1> There have been virtually no analyses of the dynamic political

struggles along class and gender lines over the formulation of legislation on

equal pay for equal work, or equal pay for work of equal value. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-017#18:1> The purpose of this book is to examine the three basic areas in

which the political struggles over pay equity have been waged.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#19:1> These are the <it> paid capitalist workplace </it> ( offices and

factories), the capital and labour <it> marketplace </it> ( where jobs are

obtained in ex <l> change for wages), and the <it> household workplace </it>

( where the work involved in bearing and raising children is performed).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#20:1> Most of the examples in this book are drawn from the federal levels

in Canada and the United States, the provinces of Manitoba and Ontario, and,

to a lesser extent, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-017#21:1> The first thesis of this book is that in both countries a

coalition of business and neo-conservative anti-feminist organizations has

opposed equal pay for work of equal value by seeking to restrict questions of

gender-based income to non-discriminatory factors in the household and

marketplace, and to prevent state interven <l> tion in the capitalist

workplace and marketplace.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#22:1> At the same time, a feminist-labour alliance of women's organizations

and trade unions has supported state intervention in the form of equal pay

for work of equal value by struggling to place responsibility for unequal pay

on the shoulders of employers in the workplace, who by their discriminatory

hiring and promotion practices have, in effect, taken advantage of women's

double day of labour in the household and the paid labour force.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#23:1> The polar-opposite par <l> ticipants in these struggles have been

activist trade-union and new middle-class women on the one side and senior

corporate execu <l> tive men on the other.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#24:1> Corporate women have leaned towards gender rather than class in

supporting pay equity, though not without some compromise with their

privileged class position.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#25:1> After decades of socialization into patriarchal ideologies;

trade-union men have leaned towards gender and class interests to support

equal-pay legislation, though not without a painful strug <l> gle with their

sister unionists.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#26:1> In danger of being left out of the struggle over pay equity

altogether, men in the new middle class of professionals, managers, and

intelligentsia in both the public and private sectors have been pulled

towards both sides.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#27:1> This split has been especially evident among male economists,

corporate consultants, lawyers, media writers, and state bureaucrats, al <l>

though their centre of gravity, especially in the United States, appears to

have shifted somewhat to an ideological defence of the male business-class

position. <fnr> <sp> 5 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-017#28:1> Anti-feminists and neo-conservatives have feared that the hid <l>

den agenda in the campaign for equal pay for work of equal value is the

destruction of the patriarchal nuclear family.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#29:1> Giving women pay equivalent to men's would make them less dependent

on men, loosen their ties to the home, and provide them with greater

incentive to pursue careers outside.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#30:1> It has therefore been impor <l> tant for anti-feminist

neo-conservatives to maintain the traditional separation between the public

sphere of the state, the capitalist workplace, and the marketplace, and the

private sphere of the household, since they see the labour and women's

movements as attempting to link them in assessing the causes of, and recom

<l> mending the solutions to, unequal pay.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#31:1> The irony is that feminist and labour organizations have not

forcefully made such links between the private and public spheres, even

though they have often been made by both socialist and radical feminists.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-017#32:1> In each of the three areas of struggle ( paid workplace,

marketplace, and household workplace), the focal points are class and gender.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#33:1> A third issue, race / ethnicity, has often been pushed into the

background <fnr> <sp> 6 </sp> </fnr> , and in response, women-of-colour or

<l> ganizations have fought to bring this issue to the centre of pay-equity

struggles. <fnr> <sp> 7 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#34:1> A dialectical relation exists between the structures and struggles of

class, gender, and race / ethnicity: even though the structuring of class,

gender, and race / ethnicity im <l> poses limits on the kinds of struggles

that can emerge, class, feminist, and anti-racist struggles may set the

agenda as to the content of structural changes that will occur through

equal-pay legislation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#35:1> For example, the structural differences in wealth be <l> tween white

businessmen and visible-minority working-class women has meant that the

former could use high-priced lawyers and consultants in lobbying governments

over pay equity while the latter could not.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#36:1> Structure thus places limits on struggles.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#37:1> At the same time, the struggle by trade unions and working-class

women's organizations to ensure that pay equity is not achieved simply by

lowering the wages of men has put so much pressure on governments that they

have inserted clauses in pay-equity acts forbidding employers to lower men's

wages to equalize the pay between women and men.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#38:1> Thus struggles affect the content of structural changes in women's

and men's wages.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#39:1> As noted in Appendix A, in the 1980s the women's movement has become

much more conscious of racism both in the broader society and within itself.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#40:1> But business and neo-conservative elements within the new middle

class have sought to exploit racial and ethnic ( as well as gender) divisions

in both the women's movement and the labour movement in order to divide the

solidarity of the campaign for a political solution to gender-based unequal

pay.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#41:1> Trade unions and visible-minority women's organizations have fought

back by minimizing their internal racial, gender, and class differences. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-017#42:1> Using Gramsci's concept of <quote> 'passive revolution' </quote>

, a second thesis will be suggested in Chapter 5: that ( a) racist and

anti-feminist neo-conservative elements, reacting to a perceived threat to

the patriarchal nuclear household from the labour-feminist alliance, have

tried to fracture the solidarity of the labour and women's movements along

the lines of classism, racism, and sexism; and ( b) patriarchal capitalist

states have tried to co-opt these move <l> ments by framing weak pay-equity

legislation containing numerous loopholes and defects that make it difficult

for women to win pay-equity adjustments.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#43:1> The legislation of equal pay for work of equal value, although a

victory for feminists and trade unionists, also represents an attempt on the

part of the state to co-opt the labour and women's movements not only on

behalf of business, anti-feminist, and neo-conservative interests, but at

their behest. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#44:1> <h> <bold> CAVEATS </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-017#45:1> Six caveats are in order here.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#46:1> First, this book deals almost ex <l> clusively with those

jurisdictions where equal-pay-for-work-of-equal-value legislation is now in

place.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#47:1> It does not examine the <it> lack </it> of such legislation in

Alberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Saskatchewan.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#48:1> And it pays only cursory attention to developments in Prince Edward

Island and Nova Scotia, both of which legislated equal pay for work of equal

value in the public sector in 1988, and in Quebec, which legislated proactive

equal value in its human-rights law of 1975. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-017#49:1> Second, although it is possible to analytically separate the com

<l> ponents of the gendered wage gap in terms of workplace, marketplace, and

household, those three areas overlap consider <l> ably: together they form a

triangle, with each merely an extension of the other two. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-017#50:1> Third, the intricacies of the strategies negotiated between

women's groups and labour organizations, and the gender ten <l> sions between

them, are not dealt with in detail in this book.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#51:1> That is a separate research project requiring intensive in-depth

inter <l> viewing of participants in both kinds of organizations as they

develop their respective tactics in the fight for pay equity. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-017#52:1> Fourth, the intricate process of collective bargaining over the

setting up of job-evaluation and pay-equity plans - in other words, the

implementation of legislation, once it is on the statute books - is not

discussed.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#53:1> This is another subject that requires a separate project, based,

again, on in-depth interviewing of par <l> ticipants in the process. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-017#54:1> The fifth caveat concerns <quote> 'class' </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#55:1> Although working-class trade-union organizations have clashed with

business-class associations over the shape of pay-equity leg <l> islation,

there is a sense in which class has not been a consideration.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#56:1> Framers of pay-equity legislation have tended to ignore the question

not only of ethnic and racial differences, but also of class differences, in

favour of an exclusive emphasis on gender differences in rates of pay.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#57:1> There has been little discussion of the value of working-class labour

compared to that of the work performed by managers and employers, the class

superiors of workers.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#58:1> In a retrospective critical examination of equal pay for work of

equal value, George Ehring, legislative assistant in the NDP caucus of the

Ontario legislature, observed: <X> <quote> 'What we really need is a

mechanism that compares the relative value of the work performed by

secretaries, childcare workers and hair-dressers with that of their bosses.'

</quote> <fnr> <sp> 8 </sp> </fnr> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-017#59:1> The sixth caveat is the most difficult to discuss.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#60:1> There is considerable ambiguity in the literature as to the precise

meanings of <mention> 'equal pay' </mention> , <mention> 'equal work'

</mention> , <mention> 'equal value' </mention> , <mention> 'equivalent

value' </mention> , <mention> 'comparable worth' </mention> , and <mention> 'pay

equity' </mention> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#61:1> <mention> 'Equal work' </mention> is based on comparisons between

jobs that are identical.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#62:1> <mention> 'Similar work' </mention> depends on comparisons between

jobs that are similar or substantially similar.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#63:1> <mention> 'Equal value' </mention> or, to use the American term,

<mention> 'comparable worth' </mention> , is based on comparisons between

jobs that may be quite dissimilar but that can be equated in terms of a

composite of effort, skill, responsibility, and working conditions ( some

subdimensions of these four factors are listed in Appendix B).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#64:1> The ambiguity in the use of these terms reflects in part the nature

of class and feminist struggles as business and anti-feminists attempt to

restrict the meaning of pay equity to equal pay for identical or similar

work, while labourites and feminists attempt to broaden the term to include

equal pay for work of equal or comparable value. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-017#65:1> The Vancouver Women's Resource Centre has raised the question of

whether the state has used the term <mention> 'pay equity' </mention> -

rather than the more potent <mention> 'equal pay for work of equal value'

</mention> - to co-opt or defeat the feminist drive for truly equivalent

wages between women and men.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#66:1> One example might be the use of <mention> 'pay equity' </mention> in

the 1987 Ontario Pay Equity Act, which went into effect on 1 Jan. 1988. <fnr>

<sp> 10 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#67:1> As this Act was being debated and amended between 1985 and 1987,

lobby groups on both sides of the issue widely interpreted it to mean equal

pay for work of equal value.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#68:1> Although the term <mention> 'equal value' </mention> appears in the

Act, the complete phrase <mention> <it> 'equal pay for work of equal value'

</it> </mention> does not, despite the efforts of the Ontario Equal Pay

Coalition to have it inserted. <fnr> <sp> 11 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#69:1> In 1989, after the dust in the debate had settled, the Ontario Pay

Equity Commission stated that <it> equal pay for work of equal value </it>

means that <quote> 'male and female employees must be equally compensated

where work undertaken within an establishment is of equal value.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#70:1> <X> Jobs are deemed to be comparable where the same skill, effort,

responsibility and working conditions apply.' </quote> </X>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#71:1> <it> Pay equity </it> , on the other hand, is <X> <quote> 'a policy

or legislated provision requiring that work performed by women which is

comparable in value to that performed by men in the same establishment should

be paid the same.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#X72:1> <X> Jobs are evaluated according to the composite of skill, effort,

responsibility and working conditions.' </quote> </X>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#73:1> These two definitions look the same.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#74:1> What is the difference apart from that between the <it> abstract

principle </it> of equal pay for work of equal value and the <it> concrete

legislation </it> of pay equity?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#75:1> The Pay Equity Commission has pointed out a significant difference:

equal pay for work of equal value is <quote> 'often interpreted more broadly

than the concept of pay equity in that it is not necessarily restricted to

systemic discrimination in compensation based on gender' </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#76:1> Although the commission does not say so, an example of such

discrimination might be that directed against 'visible minority groups'.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#77:1> Yet the equal-value language occurs throughout the Ontario Act, and

lobby groups and the public should be forgiven if they confuse the Act with

equal pay for work of equal value. <fnr> <sp> 13 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#78:1> Why would the state, after passing a pay-equity act incorporating the

equal-value prin <l> ciple, now point to a difference between pay equity and

equal pay for work of equal value?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#79:1> Why would it now raise the issue of non-gender grounds of

discrimination when it always resisted extending pay equity to these areas?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#80:1> Is the reason to reassure business and neo-conservatives that the

provincial state has not, in fact, implemented equal pay for work of equal

value?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-017#81:1> Or is the state now agreeing with women-of-colour organizations that

equal pay for work of equal value should be implemented on non-gender

cultural grounds as well? </p> </I>
