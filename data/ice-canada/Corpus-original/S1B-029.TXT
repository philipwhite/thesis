<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#1:1:A> It's an affront to democracy to tell Quebecers <quote> they

have the right to throw the constitution of Canada into the garbage </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#2:1:A> It's an affront to democracy to tell Canadians <quote> they have no

say in the borders of their own country </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#3:1:A> And it's an affront to democracy to think that a separatist elite

has the right to deprive twenty-seven million Canadians of their right to

stability
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#4:1:A> It's also an affront to democracy to think that the Cree <,> and the

Inuit can be moved like cattle from one jurisdiction to another against their

will
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#5:1:A> Lucien Bouchard has also suggested that Canada is a prison
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#6:1:A> First he said <quote> Canada's not a real country </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#7:1:A> Now he said <quote> Canada is a prison </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#8:1:A> Twenty-seven million Canadians think Canada is the greatest country

in the world
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#9:1:A> And if Lucien Bouchard and his followers think that Canada is a

prison <,> they can form their own ethno-centric state but <,> they can't

kidnap three-and-a-half million people <,> to go <}> <-> <.> aga </.> </->

<=> along </=> </}> with them against their will
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#10:1:A> Because separatists are not the only ones to have the right to

self-determination
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#11:1:A> Cos I can guarantee you that at least three-and-a-half million

Quebecers would much rather live <,> in the prison of Canada <,> than the

Quebec-style democracy of Lucien Bouchard and Pierre F

C&ocircumflex;t&eacute;
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#12:1:A> Uh what should we be discussing this hour
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#13:1:A> Should Pierre F C&ocircumflex;t&eacute; <,> uh resign
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#14:1:A> Is his report an affront to democracy
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#15:1:A> Next hour I'll be asking you if Canada's a prison
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#16:1:A> That was the main headline <,> this morning in the <indig> Journal

de Montr&eacute;al </indig>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#17:1:A> And in the third hour we'll look at Daniel Johnson and the Quebec

Liberals
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#18:1:A> Uh will they agree with separatists that Quebec has the right to

use a referendum victory to trash the Canadian constitution
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#19:1:A> We know that Jean Charest is uh siding with the separatists that

the federal government should not have intervened
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#20:1:A> We'll see were the Quebec Liberals stand
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#21:1:A> The number to call is seven nine oh oh nine nine one
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#22:1:A> Star eight two five five for Bell Mobility subscribers
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#23:1:A> You're listening to the <@> Timmy Shoemaker </@> talk show on C J A

D
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#24:1:A> And this hour our topic Pierre F his report
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#25:1:A> Is it an affront to democracy and do you believe that he should

resign
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#26:1:A> Uh we'll go to uh our first caller
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#27:1:A> Let's go to <@> Sydney </@>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#28:1:A> Good afternoon
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#29:1:A> You're on C J A D

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#30:1:B> Good afternoon
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#31:1:B> How're you doing

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#32:1:A> Fine how are you

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#33:1:B> <O> laugh </O> I don't know how I am <,> living where I am
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#34:1:B> Uhm I just wanted to touch base with you
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#35:1:B> First of all <,> I'm glad you're still talking about this fraud

thing cos I think it's <,> it's probably more important right now than even

the uh the Hebert court case
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#36:1:B> I find it incredible that Pierre F C&ocircumflex;t&eacute;'s report

stopped where it did
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#37:1:B> Or that he stopped <}> <-> where </-> <=> where </=> </}> it did
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#38:1:B> To answer your question I don't think he will resign
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#39:1:B> But I do think that we as a population and uh we've got to stir up

<}> <-> our </-> <=> our </=> </}> politicians to get them digging further

into this thing
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#40:1:B> And <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> think <}> <-> if we </-> <=> if

we </=> </}> keep digging we'll Pierre F C&ocircumflex;t&eacute; will

probably wind up being fired if not charged

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#41:1:A> I think we shouldn't give up on it

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#42:1:A> I heard uh Thomas Mulcair the M N A <&> Member of the National

Assembly </&> for Chomedey who fought this brave fight from the beginning <,>

he's not giving up on it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#43:1:A> He's upset with uh Pierre F C&ocircumflex;t&eacute;'s conclusions
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#44:1:A> I'm upset by it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#45:1:A> I think many people are upset by it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#46:1:A> This is absurd
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#47:1:A> I mean <,> tell this to anyone
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#48:1:A> Again the same thing applies as uh applies to everything else in

Quebec
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#49:1:A> Try telling this to somebody outside this province <,> or outside

this country
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#50:1:A> Twenty-two thousand twenty-two thousand boxes untouched <,> <{> <[>

out of twenty-two thousand-three-hundred </[>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#51:1:A> It's an absurdity

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#52:1:B> <[> <O> laugh </O> I know it's </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#53:1:B> It's incredible
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#54:1:B> I watched last night I watched <indig> Le point </indig> and uh

Pierre F C&ocircumflex;t&eacute; was interviewed
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#55:1:B> I don't know if you saw it or heard of it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#56:1:B> But he again restated which I guess had said earlier <}>

<-that the > </-> <=> uh that the </=> </}> unity rally was more an affront

to Quebec's democracy <}> <-> than </-> <=> than </=> </}> the electoral

fraud

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#57:1:A> Okay I'm glad you brought that up
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#58:1:A> I want to get to the uh
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#59:1:A> I want to get to the unity rally
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#60:1:A> And we'll do that and we'll also be back with more of your calls

after we hear from <@> Kenny Mulder </@> with C J A D Skywatch Traffic </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#61:2:A> We are back
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#62:2:A> You're listening to the <@> Timmy Shoemaker </@> talk show on C J A

D
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#63:2:A> We're talking about Pierre F C&ocircumflex;t&eacute; and whether or

not he should <,> uh resign
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#64:2:A> He thinks uh he's very upset <}> <-> about </-> <=> uh about </=>

</}> people coming to uh Montreal for the Canada Day rally
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#65:2:A> He's not that upset about out and out voter fraud and stealing of

ballots <,> but when it comes to this rally he's quite upset and he feels

that uh companies and individuals uh outside Quebec were involved in last

fall's unity rally
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#66:2:A> Now this is gone <}> <-> to </-> <=> to </=> </}> lengths that are

truly <}> <-> <.> ab </.> </-> <+> absurd </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#67:2:A> In this country we have freedom of speech
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#68:2:A> We have freedom of assembly
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#69:2:A> We have freedom to travel
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#70:2:A> But there is such a state of delusion in Quebec that the electoral

officer feels that before people can decide whether they will travel to

Quebec during referendum they have to have Daniel Johnson approve their

expenses
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#71:2:A> I'm not making this up
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#72:2:A> This is <}> <-> what </-> <=> what </=> </}> is happening
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#73:2:A> It is outrageous
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#74:2:A> Now a lot of the people of course refuse to even talk to his <}>

<-> <.> investig </.> </-> <=> investigators </=> </}> cos they have uh no uh

right to do that
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#75:2:A> Most uh legal experts agree that Quebec can't possibly make its

referendum law stick against <,> transactions that took place beyond uh the

borders of uh Quebec
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#76:2:A> The sale of a ticket or the <,> the rental of a bus
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#77:2:A> I mean there is freedom of assembly
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#78:2:A> People have the right to come to Quebec
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#79:2:A> Quebec is still part of Canada
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#80:2:A> They can travel here <,> and march here and put up a <,> a banner

and do what they want
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#81:2:A> To suggest that they have to have these expenses approved <,> by

the head of the no committee while they ignore all the work the unions did
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#82:2:A> <}> <-> It's it's </-> <=> There's </=> </}> only one word for it

and that word is <mention> absurd </mention>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#83:2:A> Let's go back to the phones
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#84:2:A> <@> Norman </@>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#85:2:A> Good afternoon
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#86:2:A> You're on C J A D

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#87:2:B> Good afternoon uh <@> Timmy </@>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#88:2:B> Uh I know you're a master of words and a great debater
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#89:2:B> And uhm I not often agree with what you say but in general uhm I

appreciate the way you defend your cause
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#90:2:B> You are not an analyst
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#91:2:B> You are a militant but that's alright with me
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#92:2:B> But I think this time you are pushing really too <,> too far
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#93:2:B> And I think that uh Mister <,> uh what's his name <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#94:2:B> <{> <[> Mister C&ocircumflex;t&eacute; </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#95:2:A> <[> Mister C&ocircumflex;t&eacute; </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#96:2:B> And as Judge uh Goldbloom are both people of great competence

and great integrity

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#97:2:A> Wait wait a second
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#98:2:A> It's
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#99:2:A> First of all it's Judge Gold and the thing is in terms of the

integrity
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#100:2:A> So as far as you're concerned looking at two-hundred-and-ninety is

enough <,,> right
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#101:2:A> Two-hundred-and-ninety boxes <}> <-> and leaving the </-> <=> and

finding some </=> </}> fraud but nonetheless ignoring the twenty-two-thousand

other boxes <,> that's okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#102:2:B> Okay let's put the thing in context

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#103:2:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#104:2:B> They are twenty-thousand boxes <,> okay
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#105:2:B> Twenty-thousand-three-hundred-and-something
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#106:2:B> Now <,> on each boxes there was a representative of the no and a

representative of the yes committee

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#107:2:A> That's right
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#108:2:A> And when there was a conflict the yes committee was the one that

had the final decision

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#109:2:B> Yes <{> <[> but </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#110:2:A> <[> Okay </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#111:2:B> A no member had a recourse
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#112:2:B> And <,> as I know the militancy of the federalists I know <}> <->

if </-> <=> why </=> </}> are we looking at twenty-nine boxes
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#113:2:B> Because they complained there were irregularities there
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#114:2:B> And since then <}> <-> they have </-> <=> you have </=> </}> been

trying everywhere to find if there were not any other places where there were

<{> <[> irregularities and <}> <-> they </-> <=> nobody </=> came in with any

one </}> </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#115:2:A> <[> Well well <@> Norman </@> <@> Norman </@> <}> <-> <.> ho

</.> </-> <+> hold </+> </}> it hold it </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#116:2:A> <@> Norman </@> you and I had this same conversation uh or a

similar conversation yesterday
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#117:2:A> <{> <[> Uh you have your theory I have you have </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#118:2:B> <[> Yes you cut me off during the same topic </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#119:2:A> Yes you have your theory
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#120:2:A> I have mine
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#121:2:A> But I mean it certainly would have been easy to check a few more

boxes to look into a few more ridings than just to look at three ridings very

carefully
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#122:2:A> And the other issue uh over here <@> Norman </@> that's very

important
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#123:2:A> You're talking about how militant the federalists are
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#124:2:A> I'm telling you that uh for the no <{> <[> scrutineers </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#125:2:B> <[> Uh </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#126:2:A> Excuse me let me finish
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#127:2:A> For the no scrutineers in Lac Saint Jean <,> it would have been

pretty difficult for them to throw a big fuss because their neighbours and

friends and relatives are all yes supporters
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#128:2:A> They didn't want to make a big issue out of it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#129:2:A> So they may have let no votes been thrown out
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#130:2:A> <{> <[> What's wrong
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#131:2:A> Listen </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#132:2:B> <[> That's proof That's a <?> tangent </?> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#133:2:A> So why don't you prove me wrong
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#134:2:A> I mean <}> <-> it's a </-> <=> there's a </=> </}> very easy way

to prove that I'm wrong <,> and that's by <{> <[> looking into the boxes </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#135:2:B> <[> Well if that's that's </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#136:2:A> And you know what
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#137:2:A> If they look into the other boxes and they find that there is no

evidence of voter fraud in the other twenty-two thousand
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#138:2:A> They don't have to look into twenty-two thousand
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#139:2:A> Let them look at another five hundred <,> or a thousand and they

find no evidence I will publicly apologize <,> if they do that
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#140:2:A> Thank you for calling
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#141:2:A> Let's go to our next uh caller
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#142:2:A> We go to uh <@> Adam </@ 
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#143:2:A> Good afternoon
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#144:2:A> You're on C J A D

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#145:2:C> Hi <@> Timmy </@>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#146:2:C> Uhm one of the things that I found rather bizarre
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#147:2:C> I mean <}> <-> it's a </-> <=> it's a </=> </}> serious issue but

I mean it's sort of got <}> <-> <.> asp </.> </-> <=> twilight zone aspects

</=> </}> to it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#148:2:C> When uhm Pierre F C&ocircumflex;t&eacute; says that there's

absolutely no evidence <}> <-> of a </-> <=> of a </=> </}> national

conspiracy
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#149:2:C> Well of course no one is actually talking about a national

conspiracy
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#150:2:C> The worry is that there is a provincial <{> <[> conspiracy </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#151:2:A> <[> Conspiracy </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#152:2:A> No <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> noticed that
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#153:2:A> That we use <}> <-> that </-> <=> that </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#154:2:A> Even uh Judge Gold used the word uh <mention> national <{> <[>

conspiracy </[> </mention>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#155:2:C> <[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#156:2:A> Yes I know
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#157:2:A> I don't think anyone in Saskatoon was involved

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#158:2:C> No

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#159:2:A> Right

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#160:2:C> And the other thing
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#161:2:C> I mean unless they're talking about the conspiracy to sell plane

tickets
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#162:2:C> But what also strikes me as strange is <}> <-> <.> fir </.> </->

<=> first </=> </}> of all <}> <-> they're </-> <=> they're </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#163:2:C> It looks like they were desperate to find something <}> <-> to

</-> <=> to </=> </}> take the attention away from what would normally be

worrisome in a democracy like tampering with votes
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#164:2:C> Uh they suppressed uhm free speech
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#165:2:C> I mean it's a matter <}> <-> of </-> <=> of </=> </}> public

record that federalists like Guy Bertrand Keith Henderson and Steven Scott

Brent Tyler <{1> <[1> wanted to actually </[1> argue publicly <}> <-> as a

</-> <=> as a </=> </}> political argument the issue of the rule of law
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#166:2:C> And for three of the four weeks they were suppressed by law <}>

<-> by </-> <=> from </=> </}> uh exercising <{2> <[2> that democratic right

</[2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-029#167:2:A> <[1> Right now </[1> </{1>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#168:2:A> <[2> Well I think that's why </[2> </{2> it's a very good idea

that Robert Libman is taking this to uh the Supreme Court
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#169:2:A> The whole referendum law is unfair
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#170:2:A> These are rules made by separatists to make it uh convenient as

possible and the other nationalist party doesn't like to do much to

contradict them because they want to get these soft nationalist votes
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#171:2:A> And in the meanwhile all of the people of uh Canada have to uh

suffer
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#172:2:A> Thank you for calling
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#173:2:A> We'll be back with more calls after we take this break <X>

Commercial advertisements </X>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#174:2:A> Good afternoon
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#175:2:A> We're back
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#176:2:A> You're listening to the <@> Timmy Shoemaker </@> talk show on C J

A D and <}> <-> our </-> <=> my </=> </}> previous caller <@> Norman </@>

mentioned that I'm uh not really a political analyst but I'm a militant
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#177:2:A> Well first of all I analyze politics uh for a living
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#178:2:A> But should I pretend that I don't care <,> there's a difference

whether this country's broken apart or not
<ICE-CAN:S1B-029#179:2:A> Should I tell you that I think living in a separate Quebec is the
