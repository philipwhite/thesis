<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#1:1> Dear Sirs: </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#2:1> This is a letter of support for the Centre of Innovation proposal

of the Coll&egrave;ge de <@> Belleville </@> ( CEGEP), currently being

submitted by <@> Nathalie P. Dion </@> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#3:1> The project proposed is unique in <w> its' </w> approach to the

use of LAN & WAN linked computers for collegial education using the French

language to foster: study skills, meta-cognition, French language skills, and

mathematical problem definition skills, by peer interaction - as well as

teacher guidance. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#4:1> The project should be of appreciable benefit to the francophone

educational community in Canada, and also to the wider educational community.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#5:1> ( In particular Ms. <@> Dion </@> is currently pursuing doctoral

studies at <@> Collegial </@> in this area, and is in touch with Mr. <@>

Marcus Jasper </@> another doctoral student here who is using a MAC

laboratory at <@> Lonsdale </@> University in <@> Lothersdale </@> for a

related CSCL ( Computer Supported Collaborative Learning) project involving

francophone students.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#6:1> Also, my most recent doctoral graduate Dr. <@> Michelle Duval </@> of

the <@> Universit&eacute; d'Ontario </@> did her work using CoSy computer

conferencing to train financial counsellors at scattered branches of the

Caisse Desjardins so that we have a base of recent research in CSCL to share

with Ms. <@> Dion </@> and the Coll&egrave;ge de <@> Belleville </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#7:1> In short there is a network of support and diffusion ( which also of

course will involve <@> Maurice LaFleur </@> 's CECM A.I.S. Centre) to ensure

the transfer of educational benefits from this new <@> Belleville </@> Apple

Centre for Innovation. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#8:1> Although some interesting collaborative learning support software

for Appletalk and WAN network use does exist ( such as <@> Gertrude Hall </@> 's

REP GRIDS, and <@> Tremblay </@> 's TIMBUKTU) nothing made to order for the

francophone collegial environment is yet available.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#9:1> However, constructing suitable CSCL tools, possibly with the new

version of Hypercard, should be well within the capabilities of the <@>

Belleville </@> group. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#10:1> The aspect of the work that I find to be theoretically most

interesting relates to the collaborative, or even in a sense collective,

learning of cohorts.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#11:1> It is not merely that you learn what you are are well enough prepared

to almost know already as <@> Dagneau </@> pointed out, but also that you

learn what your cohort of peers almost already knows.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#12:1> Collaborative learning in this sense is as much a psycho-social

identity re-creation based motivational process as a cognitive one.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#13:1> The work of Dr. <@> Ellen Harvey </@> at OISE with transformative

adult learning through computer mediated conferencing is perhaps most

relevant in this respect.) </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#14:1> <@> Nathalie Dion </@> has already conducted preliminary

experiments using PCs on a LAN with e-mail software to support group problem

definition and solving processes in mathematics which have produced some

interesting insights.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#15:1> However, the PC e-mail system is too clumsy and too bereft of

graphics to be adequate for this kind of CSCL research and development

endeavour. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#16:1> In summary I think that the proposed centre if created will be

well used by Ms. <@> Dion </@> and her colleagues, and that the knowledge,

and software proto-types that they develop will be made widely available to

the educational community. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#17:1> Hence I strongly endorse this proposal, and will provide whatever

knowledge, contacts, and advice are at my disposal to help them succeed with

it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#18:1> Yours truly, </p> </I>


<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#19:2> Dear Ms. <del> <unclear> name </unclear> </del> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#20:2> This letter concerns our, as it were somewhat belated 'beta-test',

work with AmigaVision. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#21:2> During the summer we put one <}> <-> studenet </-> <+> student

</+> </}> programmer to work with it part time to try out various features

and techniques.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#22:2> the results, after about forty hours work spread over two months,

were very encouraging.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#23:2> Our next undertaking will be to produce some lessons for actual use

in various courses. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#24:2> With this letter I am sending nine disks which constitute the

demo-reel we produced for introducing teachers and others to some of the

possibilities of Amiga-vision.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#25:2> ( It may be used by your company for any educational or promotional

purpose you see fit.) </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#26:2> I am also including a letter from our system administrator with

some short but I think important notes from our student programmers

concerning difficulties, and added features that they would like in order to

make AmigaVision authoring more efficient. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#27:2> It is becoming clear to us that AmigaVision is not just an

authoring system, but rather a 4GL ( fourth generation language) with

wide-ranging programming capabilities. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#28:2> I was thinking of linking in some dynamic simulations by using

ARex but it begins to look as though perhaps we can do the whole job in

AmigaVision, although it would mean creating a lot of new subroutines. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#29:2> My own suggestion for an added capability would be the ability to

nest sub-routines within sub-routines.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#30:2> Such nesting, or even might one dream: a recursion, capability with

respect to subroutines would be quite helpful for programming simulations and

games. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#31:2> I have thought of trying to emulate some of the capabilities of

the simulation program STELLA which we use on Macs, but that may be too

difficult.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#32:2> Also, I am curious to try MAc-ACCESS with AmigaVision's execute icon;

has anyone done that?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#33:2> There is also the question of controlling Bridge-board <}> <-> MSdos

</-> <+> MS-dos </+> </}> software such as Electronic Workbench via

Amiga-Vision / execute.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#34:2> This could be a way of training and / or providing job-aids for users

of an immense variety of software.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#35:2> I hope to get a student to do a comparison with Course of Action on

the Mac as a class project, but have no volunteers yet. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#36:2> Overall our initial impression is very favorable ( especially in

comparison with VIVA) and simple authoring languages such as Pilot. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#37:2> We will send you further reports as work progresses. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#38:2> <del> <unclear> unclear words </unclear> </del> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#39:2> Yours truly, </p> </I>


<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#40:3> Dear Dr <del> <unclear> name </unclear> </del> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#41:3> Your Intelligent Instruction Tutor project is of considerable

interest to us, and we can see a number of possibilities for contributing to

the project.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#42:3> Consequently please keep us on your mailing list, and on the list for

any forthcoming RFPs. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#43:3> The <@> Collegial </@> university graduate programme in

Educational Technology, and <w> its' </w> associated Centre for Knowledge

Engineering and System research is very directly involved in the development

of strategies for developing interactive instruction and evaluating learning

outcomes, and in the use of expert-assistant systems for instructional

purposes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#44:3> The faculty members most directly concerned are: Dr. <@> Donald

Smith </@> - an expert in needs assessment and instructional design for

industry, Prof. <@> J. Stephen Francis </@> , an expert on knowledge

representations and conversational computer-based systems, Dr. <@> Scott

Mills </@> - an expert in logic and knowledge representation, Prof. <@> Brad

Bailey </@> an expert in computer assisted learning and in instructional

systems modelling as a case study teaching and innovation strategy

techniques.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#45:3> Also our associates in the Centre for Knowledge Engineering, Dr. <@>

Tyler Arojo </@> ( Computer Science <}> <-> Dept. </-> <+> Department </+>

</}> ) and Prof. <@> Alexei Putin </@> ( Philosophy department), as experts

in formal logic and AI systems, might have something to contribute to such a

project. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#46:3> Our main relevant achievements have been my cybersystemic

modelling methodology for case studies, and various prototype intelligent

tutoring systems constructed by graduate students: <@> Gallant </@> 's

Comma-converser, <@> Jorge Fernando </@> 's Experimental design expert

system, <@> Huiyin Chen </@> 's Fuzzy logic Instructional Planner, and <@>

Wang Peng </@> 's test-design aid expert system.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#47:3> There have also been a large number of conventional CBT and

Instructional systems projects which have proved themselves practically in

government and commercial organizations. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#48:3> At first encounter your proposed IIT looks like an interesting

solution, but it is not quite so clear what the real problems it is intended

to solve are.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#49:3> It worries me a little that at this stage there is not a call for a

needs analysis, and some systemic models of client organizations, rather than

a fairly complete description of a very specific Intelligent Instruction

Tutor configuration.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#50:3> Are we being asked to come in at the last moment to curry-comb a

cameleopard which has already been designed by a committee without benefit of

outcomes analysis?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#51:3> I hope not.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#52:3> Much of what we can do is to help to configure this creature so that

it will be readily and permanently implanted in various government ( and

commercial) training departments, and be readily transferred from one context

to another. </p> </I>


<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#53:4> Dear Dr. <@> Yokohama </@> ; </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#54:4> <}> <-> Thankyou </-> <+> Thank you </+> </}> very much for the

copy of your paper on the Sense of Self among the Japanese. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#55:4> You are very polite in not pointing out more <}> <-> forcefuly

</-> <+> forcefully </+> </}> that the pathological failure to develop

adequately symbiotic collective selves in the USA and the modern West in

general, is a terrible plague threatening the survival of life on our planet.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#56:4> I was very close to my mother, and grandmother, and great aunt,

in childhood and think that this indeed does give me more sense of our

collective self than most North American boys possess.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#57:4> In general, girls seem to have more understanding of our collective

self than boys.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#58:4> However, I also found my teddy-bear a very important transition

companion ( in the sense that Winnecott describes).
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#59:4> I think that it is important to be able to hold internal

conversations among our various personae as well as with our internal portion

of the collective self, and that dolls <}> <-> etc. </-> <+> et cetera </+>

</}> used in dramatic storytelling play facilitate both.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#60:4> ( as do NO theatre masks <}> <-> etc. </-> <+> et cetera </+> </}> )

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#61:4> The cybersystemic/cybersextemic selves-in-system modelling which

I get my students to do together is closely related to the types of therapy

you discuss, but has one important additional aspect in that it develops a

real understanding of how the physical system structures and especially the

communication / control media and messages ( orders, evaluations, feedbacks

money <}> <-> etc. </-> <+> et cetera </+> </}> ) steer the development of

collective and individual, and sub-individual selves. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#62:4> It is interesting that you point out the dangers of individual

computer-game playing ( also individualized computer aided instruction)

distorting or blocking the development of the collective self.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#63:4> Sharry Turkle <&> actually Sherry </&> in her book The SEcond Self:

Computers <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> the Human Spirit, N.Y. Simon &

Schuster( 1984) gives nice examples of this although without such a clear

understanding of what the underlying processes are. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#64:4> I am interested in developing a computer / video theatre tool

system to help people play out visionary <}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}>

historical life dramas together, to facilitate better selves development and

integration. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-026#65:4> My Uncle <}> <-> Prof. </-> <+> Professor </+> </}> <@> S.J.

Bailey </@> has <}> <-> fone </-> <+> done </+> </}> a lot of work in Jungian

transformative adult education with groups of people who tell each other

their stories and re-interpret those, until greater personal and social

integration occurs.

a sabbatical in your country to study how better to help people learn to

appreciate and develop their collective selves.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-026#74:4> This, not micro-electronics, is the great gift which Japan has to

offer mankind.
