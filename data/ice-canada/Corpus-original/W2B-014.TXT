<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#1:1> The <it> Saute-Mouton </it> slips beneath Route 112's Victoria

Bridge, the longest in the world at the time of its comple <l> tion in 1859

and the first to span the St. Lawrence.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#2:1> The boat then eases past the Cubist modules of Moishe Safdie's Habitat

apartment complex, stacked on the river <l> bank to the left like a child's

building blocks.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#3:1> Habitat was built as an <quote> " experiment in urban living" </quote>

for Expo 67, Montreal's vastly successful world's fair.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#4:1> The skeletal frame of Buckminster Fuller's geodesic dome, another

vestige of the fair, peeks above the foliage of Ile Ste-H&eacute;l&egrave;ne,

one of a dozen islets strewn like stepping stones along the length of the

city.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#5:1> Finally, the passengers are deposited back at Quai Victoria. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#6:1> On first impression, Montreal seems foreign to the North American

continent, a European city somehow run aground on alien shores.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#7:1> In the past decade or so, this aesthetic aspect ( combined with an

exceptionally favorable exchange rate) has made the metropolis a bustling

backlot for American filmmakers looking for the streets of Rome or Paris only

six hours from Holly <l> wood.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#8:1> For any European visitor, strolling through Place Jacques-Cartier or

Square Dorchester is an oddly famil <l> iar experience.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#9:1> Surely, the City Hall is a copy of the H&ocircumflex;tel de Ville in

Paris, and the Mary Queen of the World Basilica a miniature of St. Peter's in

Rome? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#10:1> Yet to North Americans, there's no mistaking Montreal for any

other city on the continent: raffish, risqu&eacute;, carefree, a wide-open

town, nightclubs packed till all hours.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#11:1> Certifi <l> ably French, foreign.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#12:1> An exotic place, romantic, sensual, its past filled with adventure

and colorful characters. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#13:1> Montreal is a city of diversity and complexity, with a non-French

ethnic population that is a mixture of English and a hundred other

minorities.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#14:1> Greeks, Italians, Portuguese, and Jews each have a community

100,000-strong.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#15:1> There are Asians and Haitians too.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#16:1> Montreal is also cosmopolitan, fashionable, intellectual, a political

hotbed, a university town, bohemian, a mecca for artists and nonconformists

who gather here to slip the stifling bonds of provincialism.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#17:1> And it is a cultured city that supports fine-arts museums, two

symphonies, ballet companies, an opera company, and French and English

theater.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#18:1> Not to mention the Festivale de Th&eacute;&acircumflex;tre des

Am&eacute;riques biennial, which takes over the city every odd year and has

established an international reputation for presenting superior avant-garde

and over-the-edge theater. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#19:1> As in France, dining out in Montreal tends to be a ritual: The

best meals are evening-long affairs with a late start, uncounted courses,

unrestrained conversation, uninhib <l> ited conviviality.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#20:1> The city's caf&eacute; society, perhaps the larg <l> est on the

continent, thrives on Bishop, Crescent, Laurier, St-Denis, St-Laurent ( the

Main), St-Paul, and half a dozen other lively thoroughfares.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#21:1> In summer, these <indig> <it> caf&eacute;s en plein air </it>

</indig> - more than 400 at last count - may be the quintessential Montreal

social forum.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#22:1> Striped awnings are unrolled; bright umbrellas bloom above sidewalk

tables.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#23:1> A jug of <foreign> <it> sangr&iacute;a </it> </foreign> , a carafe of

wine, a mug of beer, and spirited companions combine with a comfortable

setting for watching the world go by and savoring the precious days and

evenings of the few warm months.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#24:1> Montreal is indeed theatrical, extroverted, and gregarious. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#25:1> This vivacious city is on a roll.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#26:1> Peaceful cooperation between the French and <indig> <it> les autres

</it> </indig> once again predomi <l> nates, except for the die-hard factions

on either side.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#27:1> The Parti Qu&eacute;becois of the late Ren&eacute; L&eacute;vesque

was a painful but necessary instrument for asserting the primacy of French

language and culture in the province of its North American birth.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#28:1> The last decade has seen the ascendancy of a well-educated, bilingual

Qu&eacute;becois business class that has displaced priests, politicians,

lawyers, and bureau <l> crats as the province's elite. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#29:1> This new generation of Qu&eacute;becois has shattered long-time

Anglophone domination of the province, even el <l> bowing into <indig> <it>

le haute monde </it> </indig> .
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#30:1> A society-page roster of a recent Hunt Club <indig> soir&eacute;e

</indig> at the Ritz ( what could be more Anglo?) reads like a <it> Who's Who

</it> of Francophone high society, with a sprinkling of WASPs for old time's

sake.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#31:1> Culturally and economically, the Qu&eacute;becois are confi <l>

dently <indig> <it> ma&icircumflex;tres chez nous </it> </indig> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#32:1> For the most part, the province and the city have turned from

cultural affairs to economic ones.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#33:1> The <smallcaps> FOR SALE/ <indig> A VENDRE </indig> </smallcaps>

signs that sprouted like mushrooms on front lawns in predominantly

English-speaking neighborhoods during the threatening days of separatism have

been replaced with the signs of a vigorous economy flexing its muscles after

a decade of political confinement - soaring property values, gentrification

of run-down neighbor <l> hoods, new Metro ( subway) lines, new museums, a

down <l> town construction boom.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#34:1> Montreal, <indig> <it> en forme encore </it> </indig> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#35:1> The Montreal street grid is actually oriented on a

northeast-southwest axis, but no one in the city follows that.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#36:1> The convention is that rue Sherbrooke runs east-west, and boulevard

St-Laurent ( The Main) runs north-south.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#37:1> So, for example, Universit&eacute; de McGill is west of St-Laurent,

and Vieux-Montr&eacute;al and the river are at the southern end of town. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#38:1> <h> <bold> Vieux-Montr&eacute;al ( Old Montreal) </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#39:1> From Quai Victoria, the patinated spires and gleaming domes in

Vieux-Montr&eacute;al present an essentially antique picture; the eye

willingly overlooks the dissonant details of modernity.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#40:1> At the district's eastern extremity a copper statue of the Virgin

Mary stands behind the tiny <bold> Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours chapel </bold> .
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#41:1> Known also as the <w> sailors' </w> chapel, its roofline is cluttered

with steeple and tower.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#42:1> This is the 1773 Our Lady of the Harbour, celebrated in the song

<quote> " Suzanne" </quote> by Montrealer Leonard Cohen.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#43:1> Be <l> side the church shines the silver dome of Bonsecours Market,

Canada's Parliament from 1849 to 1852 and, for decades following, Montreal's

principal market ( it now houses municipal offices).
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#44:1> On a slight elevation behind <w> Bonsecours' </w> classical

fa&ccedille;ade rises the Second Empire roof of City Hall, where, on a

third-floor balcony in 1967, Charles de Gaulle fanned the flames of

separatism with his disruptive exhortation, <quote> " <indig> <it> Vive le

Qu&eacute;bec libre </it> </indig> ! " </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#45:1> Farther west, sunlight gleams off the white cupola of the former

Palais de Justice.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#46:1> Still farther west, twin Gothic spires nicknamed Temperance and

Perseverance soar above the nave of Notre-Dame Basilica, cynosure of the

Roman-Catholic faithful since 1829. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#47:1> Behind these archaisms, the more familiar North Ameri <l> can

cityscape to the north and northwest reaffirms itself in concrete apartment

buildings and office high-rises, undistinguished except for the anodized

elegance of the Bourse de Montr&eacute;al ( Stock Exchange Tower) and the

cruciform mass of Place Ville-Marie.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#48:1> Then the eye looks deeper into the scene and alights on another of

Mon <l> treal's unique views: Behind the downtown spires, Mont Royal lifts a

leafy crown bejeweled with a metal cross, the thematic antecedent of Place

Ville-Marie. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#49:1> But this view is fast-changing: Both the expanded Palais des

Congr&egrave;s de Montr&eacute;al convention center and the World Trade

Centre office-retail and hotel complex will open in 1991.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#50:1> The latter will occupy several city blocks in Vieux-Montr&eacute;al,

including rue St-Jacques, formerly the <quote> " Wall Street" </quote> of

Canada. <O> map </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#51:1> By then, the area will be home to two other megascale commercial

projects: A &dollar;250-million, 51-story office tower project with a winter

garden and year-round outdoor skating rink <indig> &agrave; la </indig> New

York's Rockefeller Center will be nestled between Place Bonaventure and Place

du Canada.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#52:1> Rivalling it will be the 45-story IBM-Marathon building, facing the

Sheraton Centre, that will feature an adjoining eight-story winter garden.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#53:1> The waterfront area has also undergone critical devel <l> opment

in the past six years, critical because the har <l> borside and <indig> rue

de la </indig> Commune form the southern boundary of Vieux-Montr&eacute;al -

cradle of the city, its greatest tourist attraction, and, second only to

Quebec City's Place Royale, a repository of the nation's past.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#54:1> The 95-acre historic district extends west to rue McGill, east to

<indig> rue </indig> Berri, and north to <indig> rue </indig> St-Antoine -

roughly correspond <l> ing to the perimeter of the old walls of the city.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#55:1> More changes are in store, planned to coincide with the city's

350th-anniversary celebration in 1992.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#56:1> The Mon <l> treal Archeology and History Centre, opening near Place

Royale at the precise site of the first European settlement in Montreal, is

part of a scheme that will restore Mon <l> treal's waterfront to its former

glory. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#57:1> Most of the architecture here is Victorian, although there remain

enough crooked alleys and cockeyed houses from earlier eras to proclaim the

district's 350 years of habitation.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#58:1> The old quarter is enclosed and intimate, the scale human.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#59:1> Around every corner a new scene presents itself - a confusion of

ancient masonry and fire escapes, a carriageway leading to an enclosed

courtyard, a curving row of century-old gray-stone buildings ( no two of them

alike), a blue sliver of the St. Lawrence glimpsed between dwellings. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#60:1> Since the area's revival in the 1960s, scores of field-stone

dwellings and warehouses along the narrow streets have been scrubbed down and

renovated; they are now occupied by shops, restaurants, clubs, businesses,

stu <l> dios, museums, and private homes.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#61:1> The venerable <indig> <it> quar <l> tier </it> </indig> has become a

vibrant place in which to live, work, eat, and play. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#62:1> There's little danger that Vieux-Montr&eacute;al will turn into a

touristy museum piece like New York City's South Street Seaport or Boston's

Faneuil Hall-Quincy Market.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#63:1> Even when it was down at the heels, this was still a working

neighborhood, with banks along rue St-Jacques, law of <l> fices and

courthouses on rue Notre-Dame, and, along lesser thoroughfares, import-export

companies, shipping firms, photography studios, book publishers, printers,

nightclubs, restaurants, even a costume emporium. </p> <O> map </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#64:1> After its revival, Vieux-Montr&eacute;al was still cut off from

the river - its lifeline since the 17th century - by fenced dockyards,

railroad tracks, and a phalanx of five grain elevators that seemed to crush

the old city with their mass.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#65:1> Then, in the late 1970s, the bulk of the dockyard operations shifted

several miles east.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#66:1> Down came the fences and the elevators.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#67:1> What remained were the rail <l> road tracks, several hangars, and

four empty piers as broad as aircraft-carrier decks: Alexandra, King Edward,

Jacques-Cartier, and Victoria.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#68:1> The river had been <quote> " re <l> turned" </quote> to the city, and

a great debate began: What to do with this wonderful new resource? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#69:1> Fortunately, the city spurned the usual pressure to construct a

megaproject and instead chose a modest, step-by-step plan.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#70:1> Two phases have thus far produced grassy, landscaped expanses, ponds,

and flower-filled planters on both sides of the tracks; grade crossings for

pedestrians; cycling paths; and renovation of the 1922 Sailor's Memorial

Tower at the tip of Victoria Pier. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#71:1> People drift down from Place Jacques-Cartier, the heart of

Vieux-Montr&eacute;al, to stroll around the piers or rent bicycles and

quadricycles.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#72:1> Clowns, jugglers, musicians, balloon sculptors, and food vendors add

to the festive air as a once moribund part of town comes alive with activity.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#73:1> Concerts take place on summer nights beneath a big-top tent on Quai

Jacques-Cartier; later in the evening, the musical torch is passed to

Qu&eacute;becois <indig> <it> chanteurs </it> </indig> perform <l> ing on a

beer-garden boat docked at the end of the pier. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#74:1> A flea market occupies part of former Hangar No. 8, while the

hangar's upper level is devoted to one of the Vieux-Port's two major annual

summer exhibitions, <indig> Im <l> ages du Futur </indig> .
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#75:1> This international showcase highlights the latest technological

advances in the visual arts: laser and video displays, computer graphics,

holography, sound-and-light-wave sculptures, computer-synthesized

sound-scapes, and multi-sensory, multi-media installations.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#76:1> Each year the exhibition presents a different country's artists,

cultural organizations, and corporations.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#77:1> Next door in Hangar No. 9 is Expotec, an equally popular annual

exhibition presenting interactive displays about the latest scientific

research and technological develop <l> ments of interest to the general

public.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#78:1> Attracting some 300,000 people, the 1990 exhibition was about sports

of every kind.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#79:1> Also here is the 7-story-high, 70-foot-wide IMAX Super Cinema screen,

which presents films year-round. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#80:1> Those who would like to see Canada at work can tour the Great

Lakes freighter <it> Maplecliffe Hall </it> , which carries grain from

Thunder Bay to a deep-sea transfer terminal at Baie-Comeau on the north shore

of the Gulf of St. Law <l> rence; from late June to early September, business

is slow, so the owners dock the <it> Maplecliffe </it> at the Vieux-Port and

welcome visitors on board. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-014#81:1> Until the 1960s, <bold> Place Jacques-Cartier </bold> , a cobbled

rectan <l> gle sloping down from the ornate City Hall to <indig> rue de la

</indig> Commune, was the city's busiest open-air market ( the only reminders

of this function are flower stands on a narrow median).
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#82:1> Today the plaza justifiably remains the focal point of

Vieux-Montr&eacute;al.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-014#83:1> Place Jacques-Cartier can be magical, especially on a warm summer

night, with the splashing Vauquelin fountain, the shadowy columns on the City

Hall's floodlit fa&ccedille;ade, the sidewalk vendors and street musicians,

the <indig> <it> cal&egrave;ches </it> </indig> drawn by stoic nags snuf <l>

fling battered oat bags. </p> </I>
