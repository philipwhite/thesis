<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-015#40:2> If any of you ladies were fortunate enough to receive one of

those Ropers & Riders calendars for 1990, you would probably have enjoyed the

month of January.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-015#41:2> The CPRA's riding event director, Chris Anderson of <}> <-> Ricky

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-015#45:3> Christmas holidays in Hobbema, Al <l> berta are unique with the

across Canada and the United States.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-015#46:3> A total payoff of &dollar;55,000 brought Canadian and World Champions

to the four-day event beginning on Boxing Day.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-015#47:3> Pre <l> sentations of various Native nations on horseback during the

grand entries and Native dancers added to the spirit of the events, as did

the appearances of Santa Claus riding a flashy saddle bronc. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-015#48:3> Wayne Vold provided the excellent bucking stock and contributed

to the opening ceremonies each day by sing <l> ing the National Anthem. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-015#49:3> Australian cowboy, Bernie Smyth, took the All Around Cowboy

Juice. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-015#55:3> The third performance on Decem <l> ber 28th proved to be very

exciting in the calf roping event.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-015#56:3> Tim Williamson moved to the lead with a very smooth 8.3 second run.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-015#57:3> Two more cowboys went, then it was younger brother, Cliff's turn.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-015#58:3> Capturing the Canadian title in Ed <l> monton the month before,

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-015#61:3> Gerald Willsie, 1989 High Point Win <l> ner and Steer Wrestling

with an 8.3 in the final performance to equal - Tim Williamson's time.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-015#62:3> Only a half sec <l> ond margin separated first place from eight in

this event. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-015#63:3> C.P.R.A. President, Jim Dunn of Bal <l> zac, Alberta marked an 81

on North <l> cott's CFR horse, Dark Alley, in the bareback riding.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-015#64:3> Shawn Vant of Millet, Alberta with a 78 score on Ponoka Stampede, was

one point ahead of two other Alberta cowboys; Bill Boyd of Olds on Crown

Royal, and Cochrane's Keith Ullery mastering come Apart both score 77s. </p>

to the pay window for &dollar;2,141 with a fast time of 4.1.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-015#66:3> This also put him into a tie for the lead in the season standings for

the steer wrestling event with Calgary's Rob Wilson.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-015#67:3> Wilson dogged one down in 4.4 seconds to take fourth place and

&dollar;1,303 </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-015#68:3> There were a number of Montana cowboys that made the trip north

clocked steer wrestling runs of 4.3 to share second and third place money.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-015#69:3> Consort, Alberta cowboy, Darren Zieffle had the spectators

concerned when he took a horn in the ribs from his steer.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-015#70:3> He was fortunate to have only bruised ribs and was released that

evening from hospital. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-015#71:3> An excellent run and time of 14.32 by Bella Kennedy of Bentley,
