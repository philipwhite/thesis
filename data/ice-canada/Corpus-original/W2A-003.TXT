<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#2:1> <h> <quote> 'The Canadian Mosaic: A Melting Pot on Ice' </quote> : The

Ironies of Ethnicity and Race </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-003#3:1> I enter here upon the general area of ethnicity and race <fnr>

<sp> 1 </sp> </fnr> with much interest and not a little trepidation:

interest, because of my own Italian Canadian ethnic background ( I was a

Bortolotti before becoming a Hutcheon); trepidation, because of the manifest

and multiple risks any such discussion entails.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#4:1> Some of these have been suggested in an article by Robert Harney that,

in the context of its attack on Canadian multicultural ideals, has to have

one of the more intentionally ironic titles around: <X> <quote> 'So Great a

Heritage as Ours: Immigration and the Survival of the Canadian Polity'

</quote> </X> . <fnr> <sp> 2 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#5:1> In this article, Harney makes a distinction in terminology between

<quote> 'immigrant' </quote> and <quote> 'ethnic' </quote> : <X> <quote> 'to

be called ethnic in Canada is to be called less, as in <quote> " ethnic

writer" </quote> , and marginal, as in <quote> " ethnic enclave" </quote> '

</quote> ( p. 68). </X>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#6:1> This explains, in his mind, the attraction of the word <quote> 'multicultural'

</quote> ( p. 79) </X> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#7:1> Certainly, if the term <quote> 'ethnic' </quote> were limited, as it

usually is, to non-Anglo or non-French, then the associations have indeed

traditionally been of <quote> 'less' </quote> and <quote> 'marginal' </quote>

within what was once called the <quote> 'vertical' </quote> mosaic of

Canadian social hierarchies. <fnr> <sp> 3 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#8:1> Yet, just as even the English and French were once immigrants to

Canada, so too are they <quote> 'ethnic' </quote> , at least insofar as they

possess distinctive cultural customs and languages.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#9:1> If you don't consider the British as <quote> 'ethnic' </quote> , think

about cricket and Yorkshire pudding. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-003#10:1> Theorists of ethnicity have also made the distinction between

ethnicity as the lived experience of <quote> 'otherness' </quote> , and

ethnicity as <quote> 'governed, packaged, marketed, and consumed' </quote> -

in Canada, as multiculturalism. <fnr> <sp> 4 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#11:1> While not denying that difference, nor denigrating that experience of

alienation ( which I know my own family has faced), I still find myself

reacting against the seemingly cynical view of Canadian multiculturalism that

this suggests.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#12:1> And yet there <it> is </it> a distinction to be made between

multiculturalism as lived and multiculturalism as the rewriting of ethnic

history as well as present life from the point of view of the dominant

Anglo/French cultures.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#13:1> Multiculturalism maps differences - and legitimizes them through

government support for things like academic literary and historical research

and also the various ethnic festivals and events held across the nation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#14:1> But mapping differences can be a positive as well as a negative

thing; it can be a way both of celebrating those differences ( while still

remaining within Canadian culture) and of resisting assimilation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#15:1> And I think that irony is one of the discursive strategies used by

such mar <l> ginalized or <quote> 'minoritarian' </quote> <fnr> <sp> 5 </sp>

</fnr> artists to signal that resistance - per <l> haps even that

celebration.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#16:1> In his poem <quote> 'Canadese' </quote> ( Italian for <quote> 'Canadian'

</quote> ) , Antonino Mazza uses this kind of irony with a certain

deconstructive, critical power: <X> Because life for him has been labour and

struggle, Canadese, remember your father. Don't try to reject your mother

tongue, in our cage, it is wrong; do canaries smother their private song? Be

patient, don't rage, Canadese, in time we'll belong; we'll acquire our own

sense of this land; we'll record life and death of our million births; we'll

have families, above and below the earth. Canadese, you must never forget

what you are .. never! because, when you do, they'll remind you. </X> <fnr>

<sp> 6 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-003#17:1> The addressee of this poem - the <quote> 'you' </quote> - is

specifically Italian Canadian, and so my response here is likely different

from most <w> readers' </w> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#18:1> The ethnicity of the implied reader is an issue not often addressed

in studies of ethnic writing, yet the <quote> 'we / they' </quote> double <l>

ness, which the irony of this poem foregrounds, is as much the basis of the

politics of resistance as the source of the alienation of otherness.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#19:1> And doubleness - of identity, of culture, of loyalties, often of

language - is the basis of the experience of immigration in general, for

anyone, anywhere.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#20:1> But in Canada it continues to define the experience of those of any

<quote> 'different' </quote> ethnicity and race - different from the English

and French white dominants. <fnr> <sp> 7 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#21:1> Smaro Kamboureli writes of her move from Greece to Canada in terms

that acknowledge this: <X> <quote> 'My immigrant condition affords me the (

perverse?) pleasure of a doubled view.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#X22:1> My language is the window that looks onto my home and into my

homelessness.' </quote> </X> <fnr> <sp> 8 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#23:1> Of course, what for a writer can be a <quote> 'pleasure' </quote> ,

however perverse ( or ironic), can often yield pain for others.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#24:1> Yet, as I suggested in the last chapter, in this age of the

postmodern re-valuing of borders and margins as preferred sites of

articulation of difference, many feel that the margins are indeed where the

action is: that resistance and contestation make for more exciting art than

centrisms of all kinds ( ethno-, phallo-, hetero-, and so on).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#25:1> The fact that, in the day-to-day life of either immigrants or

Canadians of <quote> 'different' </quote> race or ethnicity, that

marginalization may not be so valued, or so liberating, does not mean that

irony cannot still be an effective tool for articulating both marginalization

and the challenges to it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-003#26:1> In an important early essay on the <quote> 'ethnic voice'

</quote> in Canadian writing, <fnr> <sp> 9 </sp> </fnr> Eli Mandel noted that

doubleness, even <quote> 'duplicity' </quote> , was what all immigrants live

and grapple with daily ( p. 265).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#27:1> The literature that comes out of this experience itself exists at

<quote> 'the interface of two cultures' </quote> : <quote> 'a form concerned

to define itself, its voice, in the dialectic of self and other and the

duplicities of self-creation, transformation, and identities' </quote> ( p.

274).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#28:1> I have been suggesting that irony is one way of coming to terms with

this kind of duplicity, for it is the trope that incarnates doubleness, and

it does so in ways that are particularly useful to the <quote> 'other'

</quote> : irony allows <quote> 'the other' </quote> to address the dominant

culture from within that culture's own set of values and modes of

understanding, without being co-opted by it and without sacrificing the right

to dissent, contradict, and resist. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-003#29:1> The need to retain this right is especially clear in the work of

those writers who belong to, in the latest terminology, <quote> 'visible

minorities' </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#30:1> Perhaps this has a lot to do with the discrimination that they feel,

even within what we like to think of as liberal Canada.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#31:1> Arun Mukherjee has argued that South Asian writers <quote> 'may be

said to possess that double vision which comes only with alienation from the

dominant group' </quote> . <fnr> <sp> 10 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#32:1> This is the double vision that is a fruitful breeding ground for

ironies, ironies that voice the contradictions that the outsider can see,

even within a seemingly homogeneous culture.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#33:1> Mukherjee feels that one of the most important roles of literature by

ethnic and racial minorities in Canada can be to make the dominant and

dominating culture self-conscious ( p. 95). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-003#34:1> This too - perhaps intensified - is the role of women writers

within these minorities.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#35:1> As many feminist scholars have noted, ethnic women are doubly marked

as outsiders: as female and as racially or ethnically <quote> 'other'

</quote> . <fnr> <sp> 11 </sp> </fnr> The double sense of alienation and

powerlessness that accompanies female <quote> 'otherness' </quote> has led

writers to use a variety of subversive tactics, such as <quote> 'the

authorial strategy of the trickster, purporting to tell one story and project

one persona and actually implying another message, setting out to mediate but

only pretending to do so.' </quote> <fnr> <sp> 12 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#36:1> In other words, the basic trope underlying their subversion and

resistance, once again, is irony: saying one thing, meaning another.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#37:1> Often the politicized challenges of works considered feminist, then,

are also challenges to <quote> 'centred' </quote> or <quote> ' - centric'

</quote> notions not only of ethnicity and race, but also of class and, in

Canada, of geographic and social region. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-003#38:1> A good example would be the multiple ironies of Lola Lemire

Tostevin's poem <fnr> <sp> 13 </sp> </fnr> about her Northern Ontario roots.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#39:1> It opens with an address to <quote> 'general' </quote> ( Canadian?)

readers.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#40:1> For these, she says, <quote> 'the people from my old home town

wouldn't be considered / Real People' </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#41:1> They would not recognize them from their experience of either life or

art: <quote> 'they wouldn't just walk off the page / to remind you of a

mother or a neighbor.' </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#42:1> The ironies are double-directed here, as readers are told that none

of them <quote> 'would comfortably find a place' </quote> here.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#43:1> The tone of the narration, from here on, is the familiar one of

ironic <indig> na&iuml;vet&eacute; </indig> , of the poet's persona as a

child growing up in this town as a Franco-Ontarian, Catholic girl who is

trying to understand her social environment.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#44:1> For instance, she once heard the word <quote> 'cathouse' </quote>

applied to one of the places in town.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#45:1> So first she <quote> 'watched for cats' </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#46:1> When this yielded little, she looked up <quote> 'cathouse' </quote>

in the dictionary, where she found all sorts of <quote> 'cat words' </quote>

- except <quote> 'cathouse' </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#47:1> Among her alphabetical list of these <quote> 'cat words' </quote> is

embedded this satiric, ironic thrust: <quote> 'catgut cat hook / I was

stunned to learn that catholic was defined as universe-/ al and broad in

sympathies and interests.' </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-003#48:1> A Franco-Ontarian writer - like a native, <indig> M&eacute;tis

</indig> , or Acadian one - is <quote> 'other' </quote> in Canada, in a way

that a <indig> Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois </indig> can probably never be, given

Quebec's history and institutions, which have increasingly effectively worked

to protect that particular histori <l> cally francophone part of Canadian

culture.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#49:1> However, whether the culture be <indig> Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois

</indig> , English Canadian, or that of almost any ethnic group, one shared

attribute reappears consistently: they are all usually portrayed as

pronouncedly patriarchal, and this ex <l> plains in part why the feminist and

ethnic resistances often dovetail.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#50:1> As Myrna Kostash has put it, reacting against the notion that there

is no need to attack female oppression ( or ethnic dis <l> crimination)

because these are obvious concerns of <quote> 'human' </quote> liberation:

<X> Well, I think that has been exposed by some feminists for the liberal

fantasy it is, and as an ethnic, I feel much the same.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#X51:1> I'm not <quote> 'just' </quote> a Canadian; I think there is an

obligation among the oppressed minorities and oppressed groups in this

country to redefine themselves from their own experience, with their own

purpose in mind and not be misled by the liberal fantasies of the dominant

culture. </X> <fnr> <sp> 14 </sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-003#52:1> For immigrants, the need to resist that dominant culture - how

<l> ever liberal or well-meaning - may be intensified because of the weight

of cultural tradition, made heavier ( not lighter) by distance and time, by

memory, by a sense of exile or simple nostalgia.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#53:1> Therefore the drive towards self-definition within a new culture may

well involve separation from this ethnic past, at least tem <l> porarily.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#54:1> And irony is a useful device for articulating both the pull of that

tradition and the need to contest it.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#55:1> It is also a way to challenge ethnic stereotyping.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#56:1> Here is Len Gasparini writing to Pier Giorgio di Cicco, a fellow

Italian Canadian poet: <X> Let us string our mandolins and sing O Sole Mio

every night. The joy is ours. Strangled by a spaghetti stereotype, an Italian

is supposed to lay bricks. You build poems with the stars. </X> <fnr> <sp> 15

</sp> </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-003#57:1> I mentioned earlier that what we currently call postmoder <l>

nism has entailed a re-valuing of difference in culture: difference in terms

of gender, race, ethnicity, class, sexual preference.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#58:1> The 'ex-centric' or off-centre is valued over the centre. <fnr> <sp>

16 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#59:1> The postmodern distrust of centres and the hierarchies they imply can

be seen in many ways: in the recoding of the ( denigrated) notion of

regionalism into the positive concepts of the local and specific; in the

focusing of attention on the periphery rather than the metropolis; and in the

general interest in diversity, in the different rather than the same.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#60:1> Part of this is simply an inversion of pre-existing hierarchies,since

all binaries indeed conceal hierar <l> chies, as Jacques Derrida has taught

us.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#61:1> Poststructuralist thought like his has also suggested that all

meaning is created by differences and is sustained by reference to other

meaning.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#62:1> So, while this equally binary inversion operates as a powerful

challenge to the established power of centres ( of economic, political,

social, and cultural power), the postmodern also tries to go beyond this and

to rethink binary oppositions completely in terms of the multi <l> ple, the

plural, and the heterogeneous: <mention> 'and / also' </mention> thinking

replaces <mention> 'either / or' </mention> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-003#63:1> For literary and cultural studies, the end result of this

postmodern reassessment has been a new cultivation of cultural difference as

positively valued diversity and plurality.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#64:1> A good example of this kind of rethinking in the area of ethnicity is

Werner Sollors's book <it> Beyond Ethnicity: Consent and Descent in American

Culture, </it> <fnr> <sp> 17 </sp> </fnr> which convincingly argues that

ethnicity, despite predictions of its demise within industrialized urban

North America, has flourished to the point that ethnic identity is con <l>

sidered a <quote> 'sacred asset' </quote> rather than a <quote> 'heathenish

liability' </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#65:1> While the experience of many North Americans might still belie such

academic confidence, there is no doubt that ethnic and racial minorities play

a very visible role in postmodern culture today.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#66:1> George Lipsitz has suggested that their <quote> 'exclusion from

political power and cultural recognition has enabled them to cultivate a

sophisticated capacity for ambiguity, juxtaposition, and irony - all key

qualities in the postmodern aesthetic' </quote> . <fnr> <sp> 18 </sp> </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#67:1> One of the reasons for irony's key position in postmodernism,

however, is that ex <l> centricity is what in fact defines the postmodern,

and resistance to a dominant ( from within) is part of that definition.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#68:1> Lipsitz points out that, since ethnic and racial minorities can

neither assimilate nor separate completely from the dominant culture, they

are forced into <quote> 'complex and creative cultural negotiations' </quote>

with and against that dominant force, negotiations that involve confronting

it with their own history and traditions.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#69:1> Lipsitz even goes so far as to make the doubleness or <quote> 'bifocality'

</quote> of the ethnic vision the paradigm for <quote> 'the decentered and

fragmented nature of contemporary experience' </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#70:1> In other words, ethnic ( and presumab <l> ly racial) minorities are

paradoxically both marginal and typical: <X> <quote> 'Masters of irony in an

ironic world, they often understand that their marginality makes them more

appropriate spokespersons for society than mainstream groups unable to fathom

or address the causes of their alienation.' </quote> </X>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#71:1> Perhaps.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-003#72:1> But this kind of logic denies the specific kind of doubleness of the

ethnic vision; it risks ignoring the <it> doubled </it> alienation that

particular vision may repre <l> sent in an already alienated and alienating

world. </p> </I>
