<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#12:1:A> Some people <}> <-> would </-> <=> would </=> </}> cringe at the

thought
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#13:1:A> There's so much work to be done but uh there are a lot of things

you might not want to see

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#14:1:B> Oh well I think uh

east which was a medical floor with many older people and uh
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#16:1:B> I was pretty good with older people at <?> this </?>

<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#18:1:B> <}> <-> I </-> <=> I'm </=> </}> glad because <O> laugh </O> maybe

<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#24:1:B> And I've been working there for about ten twelve years
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#25:1:B> Before that <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> only gave them one day

and I was teaching helping in a school
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#26:1:B> I was teaching children to read
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#27:1:B> And when that school closed I <,> decided to give the other day

many of your uh colleagues there volunteers who've been there for a number of

years too
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#31:1:A> Why do you think people stay around the Queen E so much

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#32:1:B> Because it's the best hospital in the city

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#33:1:A> Well that's a simple answer <O> laugh </O>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#34:1:B> <}> <-> They have uh it's the community is uh <,,> it needs

from the highest uh doctor down to the lowest person everybody is equal uhm
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#44:1:B> They greet one another like friends and uh

celebrations
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#53:1:B> And uh it was uh really uh inspiring to see that we have three

hundred volunteers now

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#54:1:A> Boy that is quite a size

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#55:1:B> And <}> <-> <.> the </.> </-> <=> they </=> </}> do all kinds

<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#65:1:B> Yeah <O> laugh </O> all the secrets yeah
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#66:1:B> Well uhm we're very proud of our hospital and like especially like

we have our new emergency which is only eighteen months old and it's just

state of the art
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#67:1:B> It's a wonderful place with a wonderful triage centre
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#68:1:B> And uh it doesn't uh lose anything to any of the big hospitals
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#69:1:B> I think we have the best emergency in the city

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#70:1:A> Hmmm
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#71:1:A> Is everybody like you uh over there <@> Jerry </@>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#72:1:B> Oh yes we're all very uh

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#73:1:A> <{> <[> Enthusiastic </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#74:1:B> <[> Up very </[> </{> very up on hospital because it's <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#75:1:B> We think that it really does a good job in the community
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#76:1:B> And uh it would be a shame to close it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#77:1:B> After all <}> <-> we are </-> <,> <=> the government has </=> </}>

just given us money uh and the go-ahead to have a CAT scan
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#78:1:B> As we speak <}> <-> the </-> uh <=> this </=> </}> construction is

going on
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#79:1:B> And now this is going to go by the boards
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#80:1:B> I can't see it

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#81:1:A> Well tell me about morale then when you heard about this

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#82:1:B> First of all I guess it was a kind of a stunned uh more a

silence
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#83:1:B> Everybody was like it can't be <{> <[> you know </[> because <,>

they've just remodelled all the hospital and uh <}> <-> it's </-> uh <=> it's

</=> </}> beautiful

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#84:1:A> <[> Yeah </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#85:1:B> And uh we know that we do such great work in the community

that you just couldn't figure we'd be one of the ones that were slated
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#86:1:B> And especially too we need an English <.> speak </.>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#87:1:B> Although we have many many French people now
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#88:1:B> I think <}> <-> I </-> uh <=> I'm </=> </}> using my French
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#89:1:B> I'm not perfectly bilingual by any means but <,> I have as many

French people coming as English now
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#90:1:B> And uh it's very much needed in the west end you know <{> <[and uh 

</[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#91:1:A> <[> That's right yeah </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#92:1:B> And uh closing all the west end ones seems to me uhm I think

maybe uh the government might listen
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#93:1:B> <{> <[> Uh </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#94:1:A> <[> So <}> <-> are people </-> </}> </[> </{> <=> are people

</=> uh ready for uh to get a little frisky about this and

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#95:1:B> Oh I think so
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#96:1:B> I think we'll get lots of
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#97:1:B> We have three hundred volunteers that could be out there with

petitions and we have all our wonderful staff <,,> that will be out there

<,,> because they all love the place
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#98:1:B> And uh <}> <-> your </-> <=> it's </=> </}> really <,,> uh I can't

say enough about it how the care that they give

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#99:1:A> Now you want to keep the hospital open for another reason <,>

right

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#100:1:B> Oh sure <,> for <@> Jerry Anderson </@> <}> <-> to </-> <=>

to </=> </}> have a place to go to work <O> laugh </O> uh

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#101:1:A> <O> laugh </O> But also what happens next year
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#102:1:A> You get thirty years right

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#103:1:B> Yeah well <}> <-> I </-> <=> if they </=> </}> close it

before the spring I won't get my thirty year plaque and I mean <}> <-> I'll

be </-> <=> I'll be </=> </}> billing the government for that I guess

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#104:1:A> Well they should tell the premier that

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#105:1:B> <O> laugh </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#106:1:A> I'm sure that'll he'll take that into account
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#107:1:A> Your enthusiasm is absolutely infectious
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#108:1:A> <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> gather uh uh each volunteer passes

that along <}> <-> to </-> <=> to </=> </}> the others working with them

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-042#109:1:B> Yeah well I think the government <.> i </.> they should take

into consideration we have a wonderful cancer care program
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#110:1:B> Our family medicine unit has a <.> in </.>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#111:1:B> Well the people from the General came to our hospital for it <,>

<ICE-CAN:S1B-042#114:1:B> It doesn't have to be if you're a worker that can't get away in

the day to see the doctor
