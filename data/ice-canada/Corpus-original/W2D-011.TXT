<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#2:1> <bold> BY BILL HIRSCH & YVETTE CARDOZO </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#3:1> When you come right down to it, caribou aren't sexy.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#4:1> But they're certainly essential. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#5:1> And watching them migrate is a fascinat <l> ing experience. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#6:1> Late last August, we went to see the caribou as they threaded

their way south from sum <l> mer's coastal feeding grounds to more pro <l>

tected areas for the winter.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#7:1> It was mid-migra <l> tion, and that gave us a chance to watch nature's

cycles at work. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#8:1> Late August is the peak of autumn in the Arctic.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#9:1> Golden dwarf willows and ruby red scrub fill folds of the wrinkled

land so that from the air, it looks like paint trickling between the

mountains.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#10:1> The colours are so strongly separated — grey streaked by red streaked

by yellow — that it looks like a giant paint-by-numbers canvas.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#11:1> We soon learned the colour code: yellow willows like their roots

soaked in water and birch ( red) don't.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#12:1> So when you want high, dry ground, yellow is bad, red is good and

brown ( bare dirt) is best. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#13:1> Our camp was in an idyllic setting of gold-tinged, rolling hills

bordered by high mountain spines that forced the caribou down to the lake

water — and past our tents. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#14:1> No sooner had we stowed our gear than a bull came over the

nearest ridge and strolled towards us.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#15:1> He was magnificent, with thick, dark hair, a white chest and a huge

rack.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#16:1> He walked slowly, seemingly oblivious to our presence, and came

within metres of our tents.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#17:1> The rest of the week, most of the caribou kept a wide buffer between

us and them.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#18:1> But beyond a certain distance, about 100 m, we seemed invisible to

them. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#19:1> <quote> " Caribou, they are really dumb," </quote> an Inuk friend

once told us, just before he shot one.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#20:1> <quote> " They're so dumb, they don't know to run away." </quote>

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#21:1> But caribou aren't dumb.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#22:1> Rifles just weren't part of their evolutionary game-plan, explains

caribou research biologist Ken Whitten. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#23:1> <X> <quote> " For a man with a rifle, a caribou seems incredibly

stupid because it will run right up to you — almost.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#X24:1> They'll sometimes approach an object to get its scent, to confirm

what it is.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#X25:1> They're curious." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#26:1> <X> <quote> " They evolved to cope with wolves and bears, which

they can easily outrun.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#X27:1> So they don't need much of a head-start.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#X28:1> But they haven't had much time to adapt to snow machines, motorboats

and high-powered rifles." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#29:1> For three days, we had been teased by the cari <l> bou.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#30:1> Except for that first bull at camp, the rest had kept their distance

— within binocular range but not quite in comfortable camera range.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#31:1> So we decided to just go hiking.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#32:1> Within a half hour, groups of caribou showed up on the horizon. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#33:1> One veered towards the water but the other, a collection of

bulls, came straight for us.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#34:1> Three of them were huge, with thick white chests and massive antlers.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#35:1> They came closer and closer until they were hardly 50 metres from

us.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#36:1> The lead male lifted his head, but when we fired our cameras, he just

stared.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#37:1> We stared back, for maybe 30 sec <l> onds.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#38:1> Then the animals wheeled and fled. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#39:1> From this close, we could really see how rich their coats looked.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#40:1> Fall hair is best for mak <l> ing clothing.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#41:1> Hide from the upper leg is used for boots, socks and mitts.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#42:1> The muzzle makes good boot soles, and the rest of the skin is used

for pants and parkas. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#43:1> Now a grazing herd came over the horizon and munched its way

towards our small lake.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#44:1> As they got closer, we could hear a curious, rhythmic clicking sound,

like rocks banging together.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#45:1> Caribou have large, concave hooves that spread with each step,

creating better foot <l> ing on all types of ground.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#46:1> The noise comes from ligaments snapping the hoof segments back

together as each leg is lifted. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#47:1> The caribou spend all summer eating, when they're not being

chased by insects.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#48:1> Fast growing early summer plants, high in protein, are used to fuel

growing antlers, which both males and females replace yearly. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#49:1> Fall meat is preferred, as well.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#50:1> Until the rut, hunters favour males because they have the thickest

fat.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#51:1> An average bull is 180 kilograms, twice the size of a cow.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#52:1> Then, as rut nears, the big bulls start to urinate on their hind legs

and rub that against other parts of their bodies.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#53:1> It all has to do with hormones, and the end result is strong-tasting

meat for a couple of months. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#54:1> Within 10 minutes, the cows and calves were drinking.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#55:1> The bulls, carrying large racks still covered in velvet, hung back.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#56:1> The animals we were seeing were just a thin line in what is

actually a 320 kilometre front of caribou moving through the mountain passes.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#57:1> There are three herds of caribou in Alaska: the Western Arctic,

Central Arctic and Porcupine Herds.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#58:1> The Western Herd ambles yearly from the north side of the Brooks

Range to the south.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#59:1> These days, Whitten says, their major wintering areas are far south

of what was used even a decade ago.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#60:1> <X> <quote> " As far south as the Yukon River and west towards the

coast and even reaching the coast in some places." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#61:1> That's because the Western Arctic herd has exploded in size

during the last two decades.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#62:1> The herd reached a low of 75,000 animals in 1977, probably because of

unusually deep snow and large populations of preda <l> tors, but also because

of large harvests by humans.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#63:1> <quote> " There was no closed season and no bag limit on that herd in

the early 70s, and commercial sale of caribou meat was allowed," </quote>

Whitten says.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#64:1> <X> <quote> " There were probably 25,000 animals har <l> vested each

year.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#X65:1> But it wasn't until our people went up and did an aerial census that

we found the numbers had declined so drastically." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#66:1> Predators also declined ( many starved because they couldn't find

caribou).
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#67:1> Bag limits came back, winters were less severe, and the herd

exploded, increasing by 20 per cent per year. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#68:1> Radical fluctuations like this seem to be nat <l> ural,

biologists agree.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#69:1> Historical records only go back to the 1800s but even then, the

numbers yo-yoed, dropping drastically in the 1880s, rebounding big by the

1920s and 30s. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#70:1> However, there's no way of knowing what could happen if their

calving grounds were invaded, as those of the Porcupine herd might very well

be. </p> </I> <O> Photograph </O> <O> Bedecked in finery beneath the closing

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#73:2> Two things set the Artic Winter Games apart from most other

sports competitions - weather and attitude. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#74:2> During the NWT playdowns for this year’s Games, the temperature

hit minus 45&degree; Celsius.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#75:2> <quote> " It's so cold, the gunpowder doesn’t burn properly,"

</quote> groaned a silhouette shooter just in from the deepfreeze.

</quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#77:2> As he huddled over a woodstove, another competitor asked, <quote> "

Is your hat on fire?" </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#78:2> <X> <quote> " No.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#X79:2> It's steaming because I came inside." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#80:2> All the <w> shooters' </w> hats, scarves and beards were caked

with ice.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#81:2> Their hands were so stiff they could barely reload their weapons.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#82:2> In fact, the temperature was considered too cold for Snowshoe

Biathlon.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#83:2> But the rulebook has provisions for such extremes.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#84:2> At Hay River, in a sort of vir <l> tual biathlon, the athletes ran in

place in a gym <l> nasium, then ducked outside to shoot targets. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#85:2> The dog mushers delayed their competition by one day, partly due

to the cold and because bad weather had delayed a team flying in from the

Eastern Arctic.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#86:2> Officials said they didn't want anyone to miss their chance. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#87:2> Niko Inuaraq, a juvenile-class racer from Pond Inlet, wore

traditional caribou and seal-skin to race his family's team.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#88:2> The sturdy work dogs are built for endurance, not sprinting, but

spectators were delighted by the " real dogs." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#89:2> The team ran in a traditional Inuit fan hitch, pulling Niko on a

komatik, a flat sled that resembles a wooden pallet with runners.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#90:2> Niko's father, Charlie Inuaraq, stood immobile in his caribou parka

for the 20 minutes it took Niko to complete the course.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#91:2> He said nothing, his eyes never leaving the horizon, waiting for his

son to reappear out of the ice-fog.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#92:2> The tough High Arctic dogs were actually too hot after running in the

subzero cold.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#93:2> They rolled in the snow to cool themselves off. </p> <O> photograph

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#94:2> Athletes and spectators both fared better at indoor sports.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#95:2> Competition often took on a neighbourhood party feeling, as children

barely tall enough to touch the net took over the volley <l> ball courts

between games.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#96:2> A couple bounced a ball back and forth with their heads.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#97:2> A player sat calmly breastfeeding her little boy as the rest of her

team warmed up.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#98:2> Spectators ringed the gym <l> nasium, ducking when the ball came

their way. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#99:2> Panda, a black Labrador retriever who came to Yellowknife with

the Inuvik indoor soccer teams, didn't seem to care that she was interrupting

warmups as she padded around the St. Patrick's High School gym. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#100:2> The AWG playdowns were refreshingly free of cutthroat

competition.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#101:2> Players wanted to win, but they wanted to have fun, too.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#102:2> At the arena, young hockey players took advantage of a coin-operated

<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#108:3> <h> <bold> Robin Sproule: A Profile in Courage </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#109:3> BY KAREN LAJOIE

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#110:3> It's mid-January and the air in Yellowknife is searing cold.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#111:3> Inside Gerry Murphy Arena, it's a little less so.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#112:3> Shouts echo over the thump of puck on boards as masked, hugely

padded players circle and sprint on the smooth ice.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#113:3> They float in patterns from end to end, in the familiar rituals of

the National Game. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#114:3> There's a slight difference from what you see on TV every

Saturday night, though: all the players scrapping it out today are women.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#115:3> And among them is one of the most remarkable athletes at the 1996

Arctic Winter Games. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#116:3> Goaltender Robin Sproule has competed for the Northwest

Territories in no fewer than 11 straight Arctic Winter games.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#117:3> She's 32 years old, a battered veteran in a game that's played

mostly by the vigorous young. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#118:3> As a child, Robin practiced figure-skating on the ice at Gerry

Murphy Arena and won medals in the sport during in her early AWG years.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#119:3> In 1996, 21 years later, she returned to the same sheet of ice to

try out for the women's hockey team and another trip to Alaska wear <l> ing

the NWT's colours.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#120:3> These Alaska games are Robin's sixth as a hockey player. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#121:3> Hockey is the defining passion of Robin's life.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#122:3> In order to play, she's had to stickhandle her way around

conventional wisdom like a forward threading towards the net. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#123:3> In her time, the diminutive goaltender has been the only girl in

a <w> boys' </w> league, and the only woman in a men's league.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#124:3> Facing 220 pounds of onrushing sharpshooter, she stood her ground,

focused solely on keeping the puck out of the net. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#125:3> Now Robin Sproule is challenging conven <l> tional wisdom again.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#126:3> And if anything, she'll have to focus even harder. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#127:3> After three arthroscopic surgeries, her right knee is held

together by three overlapping braces during practice and games.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#128:3> But bum knee or no bum knee, Robin plans to go all out to earn yet

another medal. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#129:3> That single-mindedness appeared early on, when the 16-year-old

first tried out for the Yel <l> lowknife <w> boys' </w> Midget team in 1979.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#130:3> Coach Dave Grundy ( Staff-Sergeant Grundy of the Yellowknife

RCMP) selected the young goalie for her ability and desire, not her gender.

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#131:3> <quote> " There was a lot of adversity for a woman playing at

the level," </quote> he recalls.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#132:3> <X> <quote> " Other teams would deliberately crash the net, trying

to scare her.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#X133:3> But Robin doesn’t scare easily." </quote> <X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#X134:3> If she had lived down South, Grundy thinks, Robin Sproule would

have played on Canada’s national women’s team.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#X135:3> <quote> " With the right coaching, she could have been national

caliber," </quote> he says.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#X136:3> <X> <quote> " I've seen those women play, and she's every bit as

good.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#X137:3> You have to see the desire in her eyes." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#138:3> Adds team-mate Kari Fell, <quote> " Even in tryouts, Robin is

always the first person in the dressing room." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#139:3> That habit may be part of a necessary psy <l> chological

buildup.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#140:3> <quote> " You have to encourage Robin," </quote> says Fell.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#141:3> <X> <quote> " She starts doubting her abil <l> ities.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#X142:3> She's pretty intense, but she plays better after she gets all

pumped up." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#143:3> Sports have always been central in the lives of both Robin

Sproule and her sister, Sidney.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#144:3> They started figure-skating as toddlers, but Sid <l> ney moved on to

swimming, while Robin pre <l> ferred the slick, cool speed of ice sports.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#145:3> Figure-skating took Sproule to her first Arc <l> tic Winter

Games in Schefferville, Quebec in 1976.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#146:3> At the time, Robin was the youngest com <l> petitor, known as " the

walking parka" because she was so small, her size 10 team uniform hung to her

ankles.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#147:3> And she won her first medal, a gold. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#148:3> Two years later, Robin again took the gold in Hay River.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#149:3> But she soon dropped out of fig <l> ure-skating competition.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#150:3> <quote> " The North wasn't competitive enough, and it was getting

too expensive for my folks, sending me to summer school in Calgary every

year.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#151:3> I knew I couldn't go any further," </quote> she says. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-011#152:3> In high schol, she took up team sports like volleyball and

basketball, twice earning the title of female athlete of the year.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-011#153:3> Basketball and volleyball also took her to three more Arctic Winter

Games and brought her an armload of medals. </p> </I>
