<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#3:1> <h> " SOON DOZENS, THEN HUNDREDS, APPEAR, AND THE BIG COTTONWOODS SAG

UNDER THE WEIGHT OF SO MANY BIRDS" </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#4:1> Brackendale is asleep as the eagles gather on the Squamish.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#5:1> One by one, in pairs and threes, they come down from their night

roosts to the river.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#6:1> Soon dozens, then hundreds, appear, and the big cottonwoods sag under

the weight of so many birds.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#7:1> In the dreary, winter-grey drizzle, a treetop candelabrum of feathered

ivory heads is silhouetted against the granite walls of the Tantalus Range.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#8:1> The air is rank with rotting salmon.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#9:1> Sunrise softens an overcast sky as the eagles move onto the carcasses.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#10:1> The hungry birds are alone in this hour after dawn, scant respite

from the joggers and dogs, pad <l> dlers and tourists that soon will disrupt

their feeding. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#11:1> For as long as the salmon have come home to spawn, the bald

eagles have followed the autumn fish runs to the coastal rivers of British

Columbia.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#12:1> The Bella Coola, Harrison, Dean, Qualicum, Cowichan, and many more.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#13:1> Day after day, each bird devours nearly a tenth of its own body

weight in fish - as much as half a kilo.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#14:1> In a bountiful year, when 250,000 chum return to the Squamish, the

eagles could consume a hundred tonnes of dead salmon.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#15:1> By February, when all the fish have spawned, the feast is over: the

avian carnivores again face the hardship of hunting herring, waterfowl,

rabbits, and rodents. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#16:1> The Squamish River runs down from the Coast Mountains into Howe

Sound, on the northwest side of Vancouver.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#17:1> It is the sec <l> ond-largest river, after the Fraser, bringing fresh

water to the Strait of Georgia.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#18:1> When chum are running in the Squamish, huge flocks of scavenging

eagles congregate near the commu <l> nity of Brackendale, 10 kilometres

upstream from Howe Sound.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#19:1> The birds feed on the banks of the mainstem and tributaries - the

Cheakamus, Cheekye, Mamquam, and Ashlu.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#20:1> In the winter of 1994, the Squamish had the largest concentration of

bald eagles on Earth - 3,769 - 274 more than the world record set in the

1980s at Alaska's Chilkat River. </p> <O> picture </O> <O> IMAGE: above:

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#21:1> <quote> " When you start talking about 4,000 eagles, you

sometimes forget that 25 eagles is a lot," </quote> says Thor Froslev,

curator of the Brackendale Art Gallery.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#22:1> When Froslev organized the first Brackendale Winter Eagle Festival in

1986, some 537 were counted.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#23:1> Each year, with changes in counting effort, weather, and fish runs,

eagle numbers vary considerably.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#24:1> In 1988 more than 2,500 were recorded; in 1991 only 737.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#25:1> The tallying teams were optimistic in 1994, but on the count day no

one expected a world record. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#26:1> <quote> " That day that we had nearly 4,000 eagles, I'm run <l>

ning the board in the art gallery, writing down the num <l> bers as they come

in," </quote> Froslev recalls excitedly. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#X27:1> <quote> " In one area there were 200 eagles, then all of a sudden

there were 600.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#X28:1> I'm going, 'hmm, that's good.'
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#X29:1> But then there was an area where we usually count 600 eagles - there

were 1,365.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#X30:1> I nearly fell off the chair.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#X31:1> It was fantastic." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#32:1> Froslev, a 62-year-old transplanted Dane, is an outdoorsman with

an entrepreneurial bent.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#33:1> To him, thou <l> sands of eagles landing halfway up the highway

between Vancouver and Whistler augur a tourist boon, depen <l> dent on the

good health of his beloved Squamish River.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#34:1> The eagles peak around Christmas when tourism is highest at Whistler

ski village.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#35:1> Eagle viewers are increas <l> ing, but more could be encouraged to

stop over a few hours at Brackendale as they head to the slopes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#36:1> Eighty percent of the Squamish eagles concentrate on a

nine-kilometre stretch of stream between the Cheakamus and Mamquam rivers.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#37:1> Brackendale sits at the centre of this area, on the east bank where

dikes pro <l> vide access for wildlife watchers.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#38:1> The river forms a nat <l> ural boundary, separating the town and

tourists from the west bank, where nobody lives. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#39:1> The only protected place for eagles on the Squamish is a

71-hectare ecological reserve at Baynes Island, set aside to save old

cottonwoods used by the eagles as daytime perches.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#40:1> Local conservationists have asked the provincial government to create

a 1,077-hectare eagle refuge along both sides of the river.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#41:1> Alaska's Chilkat Bald Eagle Reserve, by comparison, is 20,000

hectares. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#42:1> <quote> " We need a lot more protection on our rivers," </quote>

Froslev stresses. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#X43:1> <quote> " We need that timber on the far side for the eagles, and to

help slow the runoff.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#X44:1> It's no good hav <l> ing a river, trying to have fish in it, trying

to encourage and enhance birds, unless you've got trees." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#45:1> Recent research suggests that roosting trees could be as

important as the food that attracts the eagles.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#46:1> With adults weighing between three and six kilograms, they

consistently choose the largest trees.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#47:1> On many coastal rivers they perch during the day on the stout

branches of mature cottonwoods, close to the water and fish. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#48:1> At night the eagles roost communally, sometimes as far as five

kilometres from their food.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#49:1> Some night roosts are deep in old-growth coniferous forests,

sheltered from winter winds, rain, snow, and people.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#50:1> The same roost sites may be used year after year, yet biologists are

uncertain why eagles pick particular places.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#51:1> If these night roosts and daytime perches are logged, there's no

guarantee the birds will simply move to another stand of trees.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#52:1> They could be forced to abandon a much-needed feeding site. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#53:1> This year more than 1,600 wintering eagles gorged themselves on

spawning salmon in the Fraser Valley.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#54:1> Half these birds foraged the banks of the Harrison River, a Fraser

tributary that usually has the third-highest annual count on the continent.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#55:1> Some 18 communal night roosts are known in the lower Fraser where

logging companies are working with wildlife experts to reduce disturbance to

wintering eagles.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#56:1> Seasonal logging in some areas has been delayed until the eagles have

left the streams.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#57:1> At Carey Islands, 10 kilometres downstream from Agassiz, Scott Paper

Ltd. became the first B.C. forestry firm to preserve a communal night roost

for bald eagles. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#58:1> Eagle advocates hope industrialists at Squamish, on the opposite

side of Vancouver, will follow the Fraser Valley example.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#59:1> The seaport of Squamish has already displaced much of the estuary

with its logging, rail yards, dikes, and dredging.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#60:1> Upstream, logging has begun on the west bank, where the eagles have

enjoyed at least some sanctuary from the Brackendale bustle. </p> <O> picture

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#61:1> Other concerns are pressing.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#62:1> BC Rail wants to expand its operations in the lower valley.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#63:1> An American airline is pushing for scheduled service into Squamish

Municipal Airport, which now takes only charter flights.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#64:1> And increasing helicopter traffic at tree level along the river

corridor is often scaring off feeding eagles. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#65:1> <quote> " We've got a gem, an absolute world-class gem of a

concentration of eagles up there," </quote> says Dave Dunbar of the B.C.

Wildlife Branch in Surrey. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#X66:1> <quote> " It's an envious posi <l> tion to be in for a province to

have something that's a world spectacle, yet a lot of people take it for

granted." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#67:1> One would hope we'd heed the warnings from earlier in this

century when disdain for North American birds of prey almost caused their

extinction.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#68:1> Like other preda <l> tors, eagles were exterminated by humans as

vermin.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#69:1> Even more devastating was DDT, an insidious pesticide that reduces

the calcium content in eggs, causing them to break.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#70:1> It was spread liberally across North American farms shortly after the

Second World War.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#71:1> Eagle popula <l> tions were still crashing in 1970 when Canada

seriously restricted the use of DDT.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#72:1> In 1972 it was banned in the U.S., across Canada in 1990. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#73:1> Dunbar now is helping assess the bald eagle's recov <l> ery.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#74:1> A bird and non-game specialist, he's responsible for province-wide

eagle counts, which began in 1986.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#75:1> Each year on a day in mid-January, hundreds of volunteers don winter

woollies and gumboots to scour riverbanks, beaches, and wetlands.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#76:1> The emphasis is on the coast, where ice-free waters, abundant salmon,

herring, and waterfowl entice eagles from Alaska, Montana, Idaho, Washington,

Oregon, and Interior B.C. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#77:1> This year 6,129 eagles were counted in B.C.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#78:1> The province's total mid-winter population is estimated at 20,000 to

30,000 eagles, about one-third more than in all of the lower 48 states.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#79:1> With an Alaskan population of 30,000 to 40,000 wintering eagles, the

heraldic American national emblem has only this year been downgraded from an

endangered to a threatened species in the U.S. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#80:1> With a guesstimated nesting population of 9,000 adults, B.C.'s

bald eagles are far from endangered.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#81:1> But their day-to-day life is nonetheless fraught with hazards,

particularly on the urbanized south coast.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#82:1> Nanaimo vet <l> erinarian Ken Langelier examined 490 dead, injured,

or ailing bald eagles between 1988 and 1994.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#83:1> He discov <l> ered that one of the most frequent killers - 17.6

percent - is electrocution. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#84:1> Langelier contends that the accelerated pace of oceanfront

development is the cause.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#85:1> As houses go up, trees come down, depleting nesting and perching

sites.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#86:1> Utility poles servicing new subdivisions are an eagle's next best

choice.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#87:1> A skilful fisher, a bald eagle may satu <l> rate its wings with salt

water as it swoops down to pluck a fish from the sea.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#88:1> When it perches atop a power pole and spreads its wings a full two

metres to dry, it may touch two wires, electrocuting itself as it shorts out

the neighbourhood.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#89:1> Langelier, who has submitted a report to BC Hydro, suggests that

wires be strung farther apart and eagle perches be placed above the lines.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#90:1> Another common killer is poisoning - 11.4 percent in Langelier's

study.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#91:1> When they eat tainted prey, eagles ingest carbofurans, barbiturates,

mercury, and dioxins. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#92:1> One of the most agonizing toxins is lead.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#93:1> During the autumn hunting season, eagles often swallow lead shot when

feeding on dead or dying waterfowl.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#94:1> <quote> " Lead poisoning is a real insult to the bird's whole

physiology," </quote> Langelier explains. <X> <quote> " It affects the blood

vessels, especially in the heart, so they actually develop tiny infarcts, or

blockages, like little heart attacks.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#X95:1> Some bald eagles with lead poisoning simply starve to death because

they can't breathe, hear, or see, or don't have the physical stamina to

capture food.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#X96:1> Or they can be so acutely poisoned that they go into convulsions and

die." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#97:1> Thanks to Langelier's vociferous persistence, the government

banned hunters across B.C. this year from using lead shot to shoot waterfowl.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#98:1> <quote> " A lot of people feel that eagles are extremely abundant

here and there's no need to worry," </quote> observes Dave Dunbar. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#X99:1> <quote> " I just feel that would be a dangerous attitude toward a

species that is highly vulnerable." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#100:1> Ironically, promoting respect for wild eagles also poses a

threat.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#101:1> Squamish eagle viewers <quote> " are having a pro <l> found impact

on the <w> birds' </w> ability to forage there," </quote> Dunbar warns.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#102:1> The eagles are most active in the morn <l> ing, but early-rising

birdwatchers often frighten feeding eagles up into the trees. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#103:1> At Victoria's Goldstream Provincial Park, a " quiet zone" allows

the eagles to feed in peace.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#104:1> In the early 1990s, an average of five dozen foraged the lower

reaches of the Goldstream River, where access was restricted.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#105:1> When the quiet zone was expanded this year to encompass the entire

estuary, the number of eagles jumped to 90. </p> <O> picture </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#106:1> Park naturalist Carol Berryman has witnessed the effect people

have on foraging eagles.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#107:1> On one winter morning the tide was low and the salmon carcasses were

exposed, yet there were no eagles on the flats.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#108:1> Berryman then noticed two people walking on the estuary.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#109:1> She chased them off and several eagles immediately came down to

feed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#110:1> <quote> " People are really good about not going out there when

you explain why," </quote> says Berryman.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#111:1> A video camera and monitor now are set up in a nature house above

the estuary to provide a televised view of the birds.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#112:1> Those who want a closer look can bring high-powered spotting scopes.

<X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#X113:1> <quote> " They see many, many more eagles: they just can't get

close." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#114:1> Hikers, cyclists, kayakers, and river rafters on the Squamish

may face similar restrictions, says Dunbar. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#X115:1> <quote> " We could just merrily go on promoting wildlife viewing

for eagles and kill the very thing that we're trying to promote ....
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#X116:1> We've got just a little golden egg here in British Columbia.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#X117:1> Truly, the province is blessed with a special thing and we've got

to make sure we can hang onto it.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#X118:1> We should promote it in a way that doesn't harm the birds."

<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#121:2> <h> TEN TIMES THE SIZE OF STANLEY PARK, VANCOUVER'S UNKNOWN

WILDERNESS JEWEL IS BEING EATEN AWAY BY DEVELOPMENT AND GARBAGE </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#122:2> After hours of hiking through waist-high Labrador tea and sala,

I'm beginning to appreciate the enormous size of Burns Bog.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#123:2> We enter a grove tea of stunted trees, and my guide, Don DeMille,

points out mature pines, the tallest barely two metres high.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#124:2> <quote> " Like the bonsai forest?" </quote> he grins.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#125:2> I'm more concerned with the ground, quivering beneath me like a

giant waterbed.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#126:2> <quote> " The lagoons aren't far," </quote> DeMille says, striding

ahead.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#127:2> Lagoons in a bog?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#128:2> So much has surprised me on this hike: I shrug and follow him. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#129:2> Barely out of the " magic forest," I stop, stunned by the wild

beauty ahead.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#130:2> A series of lagoons, bright yellow with blooming water lilies.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#131:2> Brown and red sphagnum moss carpets the sides of the lagoons.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#132:2> Two hawks shriek overhead as they spiral upward, their broad tails

glowing red.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#133:2> The soporific scent of Labrador tea float in the air. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#134:2> Like many residents of British Columbia's Lower Mainland, I'd

always associated Burns Bog with the Greater Vancouver Regional District's

massive garbage dump.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#135:2> The huge landfill, in Delta, south of the City of Vancouver, takes

in part of the bog. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-029#136:2> I realize now that this is hardly a dump: it's a wilderness in

the midst of a metropolis, between the Fraser River and Boundary Bay.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-029#137:2> A staggering 4,000 hectares, Burns Bog is 10 times the size of

Vancouver's Stanley Park. </p> </I>
