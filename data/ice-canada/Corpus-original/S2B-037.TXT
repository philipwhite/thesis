<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#1:1:A> On today's feature report we'll try to find out what Alberta's

doing to prevent global warming <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#2:1:A> The irony of the greenhouse effect is that life on Earth depends on

a warm climate
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#3:1:A> The problem is it's a case of too much of a good thing
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#4:1:A> Since nineteen sixty the concentration of carbon dioxide the most

important greenhouse gas has gone from three hundred and seventeen to three

hundred and fifty-seven parts per million in the atmosphere
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#5:1:A> That's a thirteen percent increase in only thirty-five years
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#6:1:A> Scientists say carbon dioxide levels have not been this high for a

hundred and sixty thousand years
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#7:1:A> The average global temperature has gone up too about point five

degrees
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#8:1:A> This may not sound like much but the difference between now and the

last ice age is only about two and a half to five degrees Celsius
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#9:1:A> Scientists are predicting a two and a half to five degree increase

in average temperatures by the middle of the next century
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#10:1:A> I asked <@> Hubert Daring </@> of the Pembina Institute in Drayton

Valley why we should worry about the greenhouse effect in Alberta

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#11:1:Z> <O> speech, 1 min 5 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#12:1:A> If global warming were simply a matter of ecosystems moving

north perhaps the consequences wouldn't be so bad but as Doctor <@> Morris

Sengorem </@> of the University of Calgary explains ecosystems don't change

overnight

<$ZA> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#13:1:Z> <O> speech, 35 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#14:1:A> So the climate may change enough to move an ecosystem such as

the boreal forest north but the soils can't just pick up and come along for

the ride
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#15:1:A> The boreal forest would essentially be caught between a heat wave

and the underdeveloped soils of the sub arctic
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#16:1:A> I asked <@> Hubert Daring </@> if such outcomes represent worst

case scenarios

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#17:1:Z> <O> speech, 55 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#18:1:A> In nineteen ninety Lucien Bouchard then the federal

Environment Minister committed Canada to stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions

at nineteen ninety levels by the year two thousand
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#19:1:A> The federal government's answer to stabilizing greenhouse gas

emissions is the Voluntary Challenge
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#20:1:A> But since nineteen ninety Alberta's carbon dioxide emissions have

increased by fifteen percent making Alberta the largest greenhouse gas

producing province in Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#21:1:A> <@> Jim Bauer </@> is with Alberta Environmental Protection

<$ZB> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#22:1:Z> <O> speech, 45 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#23:1:A> The Pembina Institute did an analysis of the first hundred and

eighty-nine submissions to the Voluntary Challenge Registry in Ottawa and

according to <@> Hubert Daring </@> the results are less than inspiring

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#24:1:Z> <O> speech, 30 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#25:1:A> Officials from Alberta's Energy Department told us they're

excited by the high levels of participation and that it's a question of

whether the glass is half full or half empty
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#26:1:A> They say flaws in the voluntary system will be cleaned up in round

two and that we have to give corporations a chance to show results
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#27:1:A> According to <@> Tim Feely </@> of Alberta's Clean Air Strategic

Alliance Alberta's fossil fuel industries are very concerned about this issue

<$ZC> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#28:1:Z> <O> speech, 30 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#29:1:A> But just as concern over greenhouse gases is building two of

Alberta's largest greenhouse gas producers are talking about major expansions
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#30:1:A> Suncor and Syncrude in Fort McMurray are already responsible for

producing eight percent of Alberta's carbon dioxide emissions
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#31:1:A> According to <@> Roland Gump </@> Environmental Specialist for

Suncor the company will reduce C O two emissions back to nineteen ninety

levels by two thousand and five
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#32:1:A> This while doubling producion of oil

<$ZD> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#33:1:Z> <O> speech, 10 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#34:1:A> In the struggle to put the brakes on global warming we know

that all fossil fuels are not created equal
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#35:1:A> According to <@> Hubert Daring </@> coal produces twice as much

carbon dioxide as natural gas and oil produces about one and a half times as

much
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#36:1:A> Oil sands synthetic crude on the other hand produces ten times as

much C O two as conventional crude oils says <@> Daring </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#37:1:A> This may be why some American states are so interested in Alberta

natural gas
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#38:1:A> If they replace coal with natural gas they could reduce their

greenhouse gas emissions by as much as fifty percent
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#39:1:A> The trouble is Alberta gets the C O two bill for producing the

natural gas
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#40:1:A> According to <@> Hubert Daring </@> energy switching and efficiency

are only part of the first step in curbing greenhouse gas emissions

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#41:1:Z> <O> speech, 45 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#42:1:A> Despite that fossil fuels appear to present significant and

unaccounted environmental cost movements towards renewable energy continue at

a snail's pace
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#43:1:A> That's it for our feature report </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#44:2:A> Canada is responsible for two percent of the greenhouse gas

emissions on Earth
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#45:2:A> While China releases four and a half times as many greenhouse gas

emissions the average Canadian is responsible for seven hundred and fifty

percent more emissions than the average Chinese
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#46:2:A> Among Canadian provinces Alberta is the greenhouse kingpin <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#47:2:A> Not only is Alberta the largest emitting province in Canada carbon

dioxide emissions have grown by fifteen percent since nineteen ninety <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#48:2:A> This despite Canada's promise to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions

at nineteen ninety levels by the year two thousand <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#49:2:A> There are some glimmers of hope however
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#50:2:A> Gas companies like Nova are looking for ways to curb their

greenhouse gas emissions <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#51:2:A> Traditionally before work was done on a pipeline the gas was vented

into the atmosphere
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#52:2:A> By using compressors to push the gas into sealed areas of the

pipeline repair crews can now minimize the methane released while making

repairs
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#53:2:A> Nova estimates this one change is preventing nine thousand tonnes

of methane from being released each year
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#54:2:A> Methane is eleven times more potent than carbon dioxide in causing

global warming <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#55:2:A> And that's it for this week's Facts and Trends
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#56:2:A> I'm <@> Annie Gillis </@> </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#57:3:A> <@> Jim Hanley </@> is a seasoned social and environmental

activist
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#58:3:A> He organized a national grassroots campaign to protect South

Moresby National Park on Canada's west coast in the mid nineteen eighties
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#59:3:A> It was the largest and most successful park campaign ever mounted

in Canada <,> involving people from coast to coast
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#60:3:A> He began this campaign after living and working with the Haida

people in the Queen Charlotte Islands for almost a decade
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#61:3:A> Before it was over the Conservative federal environment minister of

the day had kissed the earth and pledged to create a national park there <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#62:3:A> <@> Hanley </@> later <,> led a world tour to expose the plight of

the Penan people of Borneo who were losing their rainforest homeland to

loggers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#63:3:A> He's traveled to more than seventy countries around the world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#64:3:A> He is the author of numerous books including <@> Places at the Edge

</@> and <@> A Discovery </@> a book about getting kids back in touch with

the land
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#65:3:A> He spends half of his time in Canada and the rest in Thailand

writing books and working for rainforest cultures around the world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#66:3:A> As we in western consumer-oriented society struggle to find

sustainable development solutions <@> Jim Hanley </@> has been observing

helping and ultimately trying to save sustainable cultures around the globe
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#67:3:A> I asked <@> Jim Hanley </@> how he thinks Canada is doing at

practicing sustainable development

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#68:3:Z> <O> speech, 1 min </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#69:3:A> Humans have lived on the Earth for about three point five

million years
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#70:3:A> For most of that time humans lived as hunter-gatherers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#71:3:A> The population increased at a rate of about one person every five

years

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#72:3:Z> <O> speech, 2 min 10 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#73:3:A> <@> Hanley </@> says we talk about sustainable forestry in

Alberta and British Columbia but the Mentawai people are actually practicing

it

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#74:3:Z> <O> speech, 30 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#75:3:A> The sago palm is one of more than fifteen hundred palm species

in this hundred and sixty million year old rainforest ecosystem

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#76:3:Z> <O> speech, 2 min 5 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#77:3:A> The Mentawai culture is just one example of a so-called

primitive society living and working sustainably in their ecosystem <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#78:3:A> For many of us in western society the dream of a utopian life in

the serene suburbs has turned into long commutes high stress and a distinct

shortage <}> <-> of <.> she </.> </-> <=> of leisure </=> </}> time
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#79:3:A> <@> Hanley's </@> not suggeting we all immediately adopt the

lifestyle of the Mentawai people but perhaps their's and the cultures of

others around the world can each provide a piece of the answer in our search

for sustainability
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#80:3:A> Next week we continue our journey through culture and sustainable

development with author <@> Jim Hanley </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#81:3:A> We'll find out how the Penan of Borneo met Saks of Fifth Avenue in

New York and how car sales in southeast Asia are turning rainforests into

rubber plantations
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#82:3:A> You're listening to the Chevron Ecofile
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#83:3:A> Now here's <@> Annie Gillis </@> with this week's Ecofacts and

Trends </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#84:4:A> Here's something a little different this week
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#85:4:A> From the recent Sustainable Edmonton Society's Striking A Balance

Conference we present the top five future indicators of sustainability <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#86:4:A> Number five
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#87:4:A> Within fifteen years five percent of Alberta homes have solar

shingles on their roofs and they'll be producing their own heat and power <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#88:4:A> Number four <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#89:4:A> In one decade ten percent of workers will leave the driving to the

internet and telecommute to work from their homes <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#90:4:A> Number three <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#91:4:A> After yard naturalization becomes a raging fad dandelions are no

longer scorned and dozens of species of songbirds and wildlife reappear in

urban neighbourhoods <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#92:4:A> Number two <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#93:4:A> Within a decade more community cooperatives spring up to get small

grocery stores back in neighbourhoods
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#94:4:A> As a consequence local food is better marketed and more people

learn the names of their neighbours
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#95:4:A> And finally the top future indicator of sustainable development is

<,,> Ottawa swears of greenhouse gas emitting tar sands projects and

asphalt-friendly infrastructure programs
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#96:4:A> Instead the feds encourage solar power <,> light rail transit <,>

and the marketing of new sustainable technologies <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#97:4:A> That's it for this week's Ecofacts and Trends
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#98:4:A> I'm <@> Annie Gillis </@> </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#99:5:A> Last week we began our series on culture and sustainable

development with an interview with author and activist <@> Jim Hanley </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#100:5:A> He was the architect of the campaign to protect South Moresby as a

Canadian national park in the mid nineteen eighties
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#101:5:A> Since then he's worked tirelessly on behalf of <}> <-> <.> en </.>

</-> <=> the environment </=> </}> and rainforest people around the world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#102:5:A> Last week he described the Mentawai people of <?> Seburoot </?> in

southeast Asia
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#103:5:A> It's a culture that lives sustainably in one of the oldest

rainforests on Earth
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#104:5:A> To <@> Hanley </@> they seem a happy and content people with

enough leisure time to leave anyone in the western world aghast
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#105:5:A> Today we continue our discussion with author and activist <@> Jim

Hanley </@> about culture and sustainable development <,,> <&> pipe music

</&>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#106:5:A> In view of humanity's potential to dominate the Earth Albert

Einstein's analysis seems rather pragmatic
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#107:5:A> He said <,> <quote> man has lost the capacity to foresee and

forestall </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#108:5:A> <O> quote continues </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#109:5:A> Western society seems to have developed some capacity to foresee

things
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#110:5:A> The real question remains in the forestalling department
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#111:5:A> It's perhaps why we in the so-called first world spend enormous

amounts of time navel gazing and searching within our market-based system for

ways of making our consumer lifestyle sustainable
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#112:5:A> But <@> Jim Hanley </@> has spent time with cultures like the

Mentawai of <?> Seburoot </?> the Penan of Borneo and the Quechua of the

Amazon
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#113:5:A> Many of these cultures are already socially environmentally and

economically sustainable
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#114:5:A> I asked <@> Jim Hanley </@> if there's anything western society

can learn about sustainability from other cultures

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#115:5:Z> <O> speech, 35 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#116:5:A> <@> Hanley </@> thinks we have to get beyond the recycling

stage to take seriously more challenging concepts like reduction <,>

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#117:5:Z> <O> speech, 2 min 30 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#118:5:A> In our quest to develop new markets the western world

certainly seems to have become culturally imperialistic
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#119:5:A> The western consumer lifestyle's intoxicating
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#120:5:A> It's addictive
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#121:5:A> And according to <@> Hanley </@> it's endangering sustainable

cultures and mowing down rainforests throughout southeast Asia

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#122:5:Z> <O> speech, 1 min 5 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#123:5:A> The unbridled economic development that's racing through

southeast Asia today reminds <@> Hanley </@> of Canada in the nineteen

fifties
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#124:5:A> In this frenzy of economic development people are not sitting

around debating sustainable development
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#125:5:A> In fact <@> Hanley </@> argues that many countries are actually

moving away from sustainability

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#126:5:Z> <O> speech, 1 min 50 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#127:5:A> One by one diverse and once sustainable cultures and

rainforests are being swallowed in the name of economic development

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#128:5:Z> <O> speech, 40 sec </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#129:5:A> Despite all this <@> Hanley </@> remains hopeful
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#130:5:A> It will take creativity and he says some sacred notions will have

to be shed along the way but there are solutions
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#131:5:A> Some of which exist in other cultures
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#132:5:A> Next week is forestry in Alberta sustainable
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#133:5:A> Join us as we try to find out if the forest and the trees will be

around for future generations
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#134:5:A> You're listening to the Chevron Ecofile
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#135:5:A> Now here's this week's Ecofacts and Trends </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-037#136:6:A> Material World A Global Family Portrait by Sierra Club books

demonstrates the incredible economic disparity found around the world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#137:6:A> In terms of sustainability however it's not always the rich who

are the richest
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#138:6:A> The book compares thirty families from thirty countries to

illustrate the great differences in material goods and circumstances that

make up rich and poor societies
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#139:6:A> Of the thirty families reported on twenty-one have a T V but only

nine have books
<ICE-CAN:S2B-037#140:6:A> Four of the thirty families had computers while five use a mortar

and pestle or similar tool to grind grain for food </I>
