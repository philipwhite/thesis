<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#1:1:A> Right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#2:1:A> We want to get something <,> more meaningful out of it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#3:1:A> So I'll ask you does the image remind you <{> <[> <,,> </[> of

anything in particular

<$ZQ> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#4:1:Z> <[> <O> response </O> </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#5:1:Z> The crucifixion
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#6:1:Z> But of course you only see the vertical part <,> of the image
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#7:1:Z> Right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#8:1:Z> Would you like to see the horizontal <?> this </?> cross is

completed <X>

<$ZP> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X9:1:Z> <O> responds </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X10:1:A> <O> laugh </O> Okay </X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#11:1:A> It's just one way of pushing that even further
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#12:1:A> But <,> can you see how this sculpture is on a base <,,> and we uh

barely see the legs underneath the base <,> cos it's slightly recessed <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#13:1:A> But it creates a space between the base and the floor
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#14:1:A> See what I mean by that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#15:1:A> And how it's filled with a shadow <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#16:1:A> So ya just let your eyes focus on that <,> shadow
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#17:1:A> Am I in the way <,> for some of you <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#18:1:A> Okay I won't move <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#19:1:A> For let's say five or ten seconds then we'll look up at the

vertical beam <,> for another few seconds <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#20:1:A> Do you want me to get out of the way <&> Tape cuts out </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#21:1:A> optical illusion but you should see a faint white line that

completes the crosses
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#22:1:A> See what I mean <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#23:1:A> Have most of you seen it <X> <&> Audience responds affirmatively

</&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X24:1:A> Okay

<$ZQ> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X25:1:Z> <O> makes a point </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X26:1:A> <O> laugh </O> Actually it works really well if you <,>

crouch down but </X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#27:1:A> <}> <-> <.> Kay </.> </-> <+> okay </+> </}> so we'll come and

we'll look at it much more closely <,,> <&> Tape cuts out </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#28:1:A> Uh well when we get up close <}> <-> you can start </-> <=> you see

the surface </=> </}> of the sculpture
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#29:1:A> You can see that it's rusty
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#30:1:A> It's made out of core tin steel
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#31:1:A> And we actually <,> uh also see this pronounced rusty line <,>

right here <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#32:1:A> What does that make you think of <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#33:1:A> The blood <,> right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#34:1:A> So uh if you think of what I just did I just asked you what you saw
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#35:1:A> I sure that I pushed a little bit further by <,> having you look at

the shadow but <,> what <,> you <,> just told me comes from you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#36:1:A> I didn't say this is this this is this
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#37:1:A> So again just to reiterate what I said before what we get out of

these works depends entirely on what we give to them
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#38:1:A> If we come to this <,> with a background completely foreign to

Christianity then we're not going to see this as the image of the crucifixion
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#39:1:A> Right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#40:1:A> You're going to see it in a different way
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#41:1:A> Uhm <,> I think one of the <}> <-> <.> s </.> </-> <=> sad </=>

</}> things about this painting is that it's true we bring our background to

the work and many people <,> just brought this huge price tag <}> <-> with

<.> the </.> </-> <=> with them </=> </}> as the background and they could

only look at it as a consumer object
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#42:1:A> So <}> <-> they </-> <=> <,> they </=> </}> never let the

experience go beyond being a shopping centre right where you're <,> surprised

when the price is more expensive than you thought it would be
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#43:1:A> So uhm you know just look at these works I'd say and the artist

made them for you was hoping that you'll probably get or that you'll get

something out of them
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#44:1:A> So it's really up to us and the more we have to give <,> the more

we'll get out of it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#45:1:A> Does that make sense <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#46:1:A> You have any questions <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#47:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#48:1:A> Ehm we will continue into the Impressionist Room <&> Tape cuts out

</&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#49:1:A> So we're in the room with uh Impressionist and Post-Impressionist

artists
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#50:1:A> This is a painting by uh Vincent Van Gogh
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#51:1:A> Have you heard about him
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#52:1:A> Ya
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#53:1:A> Do you know anything about him <&> Two audience members respond

</&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#54:1:A> Uh <,> <O> laugh </O> I think the story goes I'm not sure how
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#55:1:A> Or the legend goes anyway that he sold one painting in his lifetime

and uh <,> that was to his brother or something
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#56:1:A> Or his brother was an art dealer anyway <X>

<$ZR> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X57:1:Z> <O> makes a point </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X58:1:A> Ya it's true he did a lot of self-portraits
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X59:1:A> He did a lot of his paintings within <,> just a few years
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X60:1:A> Anything else that you know about him

<$ZS> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X61:1:Z> <O> makes a point </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X62:1:A> I don't know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X63:1:A> I guess you only know the price when it's sold but <,> one of his

paintings <,> sold for ninety-eight million
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X64:1:A> <}> <-> Kay </-> <+> Okay </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X65:1:A> So <,> uh <}> <-> it wasn't </-> <=> it was </=> </}> bigger than

this
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X66:1:A> This is on paper
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X67:1:A> But uhm you know like ah once you get into the millions there's

not much difference between <O> laugh </O> fifty million and eighty million

right

<$ZS> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X68:1:Z> <O> makes a point </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X69:1:A> Ya you know in those days people were just labelled as insane

and lived in institutions
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X70:1:A> You know he <}> <-> <.> ch </.> </-> <=> chopped </=> </}> off his

ear
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X71:1:A> All of these things that are the subjects of movies <}> <-> and

</-> <=> and </=> </}> books <&> Audience members discuss amongst themselves

</&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X72:1:A> He didn't sell anything </X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#73:1:A> <}> <-> It's actually <.> wi </.> </-> <=> it's <}> <-> <.> wi </.>

</-> <=> around </=> </}> this time </=> </}> where you have this break <,>

or the <}> <-> this </-> <=> beginning of this idea </=> </}> about the

artist starving and alienated from society instead of the typical artist
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#74:1:A> And that's why there's been so many <,> movies and books written

about him because <}> <-> he </-> <=> he </=> </}> lives kind of this

quintessential uhm alienated artist life
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#75:1:A> But all of this <,> is aside in a sense
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#76:1:A> But I think that it's all related because uhm <,,> when we look at

his paintings more than the Memling we just <,> saw <}> <-> in the first </->

<=> in the second </=> </}> room or other artists I think with Van Gogh

somehow we get a sense <}> <-> of </-> <=> <,> that </=> </}> <}> <-> it </->

<=> his </=> </}> paintings capture <,> his personality or we have a feeling

that we know the artist himself through his art
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#77:1:A> And I think <}> <-> it it </-> <=> uh the </=> </}> reason why is

perhaps uhm a useful way of looking at his work <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#78:1:A> For instance when we look at the grass growing in the background is

he copying exactly what he sees <,> repeating the same angles and trying to

<}> <-> medicul </-> <=> meticulously </=> </}> <,> copy nature as it is

exactly <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#79:1:A> No
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#80:1:A> Right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#81:1:A> But <}> <-> we <.> s </.> </-> <=> what we get </=> </}> for the

first time is the artist deciding himself <,> mostly hes at this time <&>

implied comma </&> what this painting's going to look like
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#82:1:A> So we have this subjective view
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#83:1:A> Uh in this case <}> <-> the </-> <=> uhh each paint stroke </=>

</}> coincides <}> <-> which </-> <=> with </=> </}> a blade of grass so it

kind of makes sense
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#84:1:A> But for instance if you look at the stems <,> here <,> you can see

this blue outline
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#85:1:A> Irises don't have blue stems right or blue outlines on them <,> so

we can see that the artist is even though he's inspired by nature as a

subject matter he's deviating from it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#86:1:A> He's deciding to in this case be influenced by Japanese prints <,>

that do have these <,> black or bold outlines
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#87:1:A> So artists go <}> <-> for other </-> <=> to other </=> </}> sources

<,> to make their art
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#88:1:A> Also with Van Gogh you know we just spent a few minutes talking

about his life
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#89:1:A> Did we talk about Hans Memling's life <,> or Barnett Newman's life

not so much
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#90:1:A> <}> <-> With <.> mo </.> </-> <=> with modern art </=> </}> or I

guess not Barnett Newman I shouldn't use an example but <,> the Renaissance

artists we're not so interested in their lives but with modern art <,> when

we look at their paintings we <}> <-> <.> f </.> </-> <=> concentrate </=>

</}> on the artist's personal vision <}> <-> and </-> <=> or </=> </}> their

ideas their style rather than the subject matter
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#91:1:A> I'm not going to go on for five minutes about what kind of irises

they are and what time of year they grow or you know <}> <-> the <.> specif

</.> </-> <=> the specificities </=> </}> about the subject matter but we're

more interested in how it's painted
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#92:1:A> And that's basically something that we could generalize with all

modern art is we're interested in how it's painted <,> more <,> than what is

painted
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#93:1:A> Does that make sense
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#94:1:A> Ya
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#95:1:A> So ah any questions about Van Gogh
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#96:1:A> The reason it's under glass is because it's on paper and uh it's a

fairly fragile support
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#97:1:A> The paper has been mounted on canvas
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#98:1:A> So <}> <-> it's </-> <=> it's </=> </}> fairly secure
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#99:1:A> We have two other paintings by Van Gogh in this room <,,> the <,>

flowers on uh either side of the far wall <&> Tape cuts out </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#100:1:A> Somebody asked to see a Picasso
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#101:1:A> Who was that <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#102:1:A> Anybody
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#103:1:A> Nobody's <,> owning up to it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#104:1:A> Did somebody mention Picasso <,,> as an artist they wanted to see

<X>

<$ZT> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X105:1:Z> <O> audience member asks other audience members a question

</O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X106:1:A> Okay </X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#107:1:A> I guess I made that up
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#108:1:A> Okay <,> <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#109:1:A> Anyway ya <O> laugh </O> here's <O> laugh </O> a painting by uh

Pablo Picasso
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#110:1:A> Actually <,> ehm <,,> <}> <-> we </-> <=> we've </=> </}> just <X>

<$ZU> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X111:1:Z> <unclear> phrase </unclear>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X112:1:A> Ya okay

<$ZT> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X113:1:Z> <O> Get's A's attention </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X114:1:A> Good
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X115:1:A> I'm not losing my mind <O> laugh </O> </X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#116:1:A> Uhm <,,> we've literally gone full circle and uh <,> I mean in the

galleries but also <,> in the history of art <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#117:1:A> When we started with that painting <,> Hans Memling the

Renaissance painting where all of these objects were meticulously painted I

said that the ideal at that time was <}> <-> to <.> pa </.> </-> <=> to treat

a painting </=> </}> as if you were looking through a window outside of the

<.> wor </.> in uh sorry outside into the world
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#118:1:A> Ehm so you would substitute the window frame for the painting

frame and you got this feeling of space
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#119:1:A> What we get with Picasso is it's as if it's the same the same

window is literally broken
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#120:1:A> So all of the sudden we see these <,> flat planes that are

intersecting and it creates <,,> a surface all of its own with its own

interests
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#121:1:A> It's not trying to pretend to represent trees or forests or

something that exists in the world but it's a surface that has its own entity

that exists on its own
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#122:1:A> <}> <-> I </-> <=> having </=> </}> said that uhm there are

certain elements that we can recognize
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#123:1:A> The title of this work is The Small Table
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#124:1:A> You see any elements of this table <,,> <O> audience members

respond </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#125:1:A> Ya maybe the legs or something here that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#126:1:A> Ehm you see part of a guitar <O> audience members respond </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#127:1:A> Ya
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#128:1:A> I'm thinking more of <,> here are the strings and then the upper

part of the guitar up here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#129:1:A> See the wallpaper on the wall behind it <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#130:1:A> Ya
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#131:1:A> <}> <-> There's </-> <=> See </=> </}> the wallpaper back there
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#132:1:A> And then these letters <}> <-> are they </-> <=> <,> are they </=>

</}> actual letters or are they paintings of letters <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#133:1:A> Is there a difference between letters and paintings of letters
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#134:1:A> No
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#135:1:A> Cos letters are a two dimensional sign for something
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#136:1:A> Right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#137:1:A> So <}> <-> there's <,> you can't it it </-> <=> there's </=> </}>

no difference really
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#138:1:A> So by putting letters on the surface what the artist is saying

this is a flat surface on which these things are signs
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#139:1:A> So <}> <-> it's it's </-> <=> <,,> it's </=> </}> a way of

treating <O> laugh </O> <X> Ah well

<$ZT> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#X140:1:Z> <O> interrupts A </O> </X>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#141:1:Z> So he's saying I'm not trying to say this is a real bowl of fruit

but this is something on its own

<$ZT> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#142:1:Z> <O> Gets A's attention </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#143:1:Z> It's paint on a canvas
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#144:1:Z> So it's affirming the fact this is two dimensional and it's not

this space
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#145:1:Z> You know we're looking at this in nineteen ninety-five
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#146:1:Z> We just saw Barnett Newman's Voice of Fire which is <,> totally

<,> flat and <,> has no object <,> represented or depicted in it at all
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#147:1:Z> So we have to think of looking at this in nineteen nineteen where

this was quite new to see these spaces and ah forms represented in a

completely <,> new way
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#148:1:Z> So <,> generally <}> <-> we </-> <=> I guess we </=> </}> could

call this a Cubist painting although uhm something like that round one is ah

a much better example <,,> of typical <,> Cubism <&> Tape cuts out </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#149:1:Z> I'll bring you back down into the Canadian Galleries
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#150:1:Z> We'll just quickly pass by the Chapel <&> Rideau Street Convent

Chapel </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#151:1:Z> I'll show you where it is anyway
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#152:1:Z> And then the Group of Seven and then <,> uhm what you can do is

find the elevator from off there
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#153:1:Z> Do you know <}> <-> what </-> <=> how </=> </}> to get there <&>

Tape continues as a conversation between A and a few members of the group

</&> </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-031#154:2:A> I'm working here at the museum
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#155:2:A> I'm in the Education department
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#156:2:A> And we're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> be doing an

exhibition today called Rights and Realities
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#157:2:A> You've got the uhm <,> <unclear> word </unclear> material for it

so you've at least seen some of the slides and you know a little about what

you're going to look at
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#158:2:A> <}> <-> Kay </-> <+> okay </+> </}> we're going to break it up

into <}> <-> a <.> cou </.> </-> <=> a couple </=> </}> of different ways of

one going through the exhibition and two talking a little bit about work that

you're doing yourselves <,> combining this all in
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#159:2:A> It's really nice having a small group cos I like it to be really

informal
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#160:2:A> So as much talking back and forth
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#161:2:A> If you have questions ask
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#162:2:A> You know <}> <-> I'm </-> <=> ya I </=> </}> like to go off the

track sometimes if there's something <,> about the exhibition or about

something in photogrqaphy that you want to know more about
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#163:2:A> First thing I'm going to do <,> is tell you something about the C

M C P <&> Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography </&> <,> this museum
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#164:2:A> Have you ever been here before <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#165:2:A> So this is all your first trip
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#166:2:A> Alright I can give you some background on the institution cos that

helps you understand what the collection is all about
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#167:2:A> Cos we have ah a collection that's really split into two really

distinct uhm categories
<ICE-CAN:S2A-031#168:2:A> That being uhh documentary photography and what's considered art

photography or experimental <,> photography uhm using different mediums <,>

other photographic <,> style and genre
