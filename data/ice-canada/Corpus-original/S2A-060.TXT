<I>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#1:1> I mean you can do the same technique of sound blankets if this is on a

tripod as you can <,> with that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#2:1> Only this has got a head start <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#3:1> Right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#4:1> But <,> okay take a five minute break
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#5:1> I'm going to go call this <?> guy </?> and then <,> I shall return <&>

tape cuts out </&> <O> audience members laughing and talking </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#6:1:A> Okay so now <,> that's how you load
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#7:1:A> When we're done you guys can play with mags try loading it <,> but

there's more you got
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#8:1:A> So the next thing to do is to adjust your eye piece to your eye <,>

the viewfinder
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#9:1:A> There's two people who need to have the viewfinder <,> adjusted the

camera operator and the camera assistant

<$ZD> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#10:1:Z> <O> question </O>

<$ZZ> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#11:1:Z> <O> comment </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#12:1:A> Director <,,> doesn't have to see the focus
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#13:1:A> There's usually video assist <,> and they'll see it through that

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#14:1:A> The reason why the camera assistant and the camera operator the

camera operator will see the frame <,> get the shot but once the shot's going

<,,> the shutter moving in front of his eye causes everything to be slightly

soft anyhow <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#15:1:A> <}> <-> <w> 'Kay </w> </-> <+> okay </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#16:1:A> And so they can't tell if you're in focus or not if you're the

camera assistant
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#17:1:A> They can tell if you're <,> dramatically out of focus <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#18:1:A> All right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#19:1:A> But they can't tell if you're slightly softer focus or if you're

sharp
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#20:1:A> So that's why you need to be <unclear> word </unclear> in your

focus cos it's your job as the camera assistant <,> to get the focus
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#21:1:A> So <,> what I did on this camera is I showed a way to <,,> set the

eye pieces
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#22:1:A> And I'll show you in detail how you get your eye piece
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#23:1:A> But what you do is you find a <,,> mark <,,> as a guide mark
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#24:1:A> And then <,> you find focus and you put another piece of tape and

that's yours
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#25:1:A> And then you put <,> the camera operator or the camera assistant in

another colour
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#26:1:A> And don't knock this <,,> because if you knock it then <,> you have

to fight to open it and move it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#27:1:A> And the camera operator never wants to have it out of focus <?> his

</?> eye piece
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#28:1:A> Hopefully he has the same eyes
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#29:1:A> There's a lot of latitude in that <,> for the focus
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#30:1:A> But if you're the camera assistant and you've just taken some marks

and now you've <,,> gone back <}> <-> you </-> <=> you're </=> </}> done and

it's for the camera operator you must put it back to the camera operator's

eye
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#31:1:A> Cos if the camera operator starts looking goes everything's out of

focus check your focus check the focus and you go my focus is fine
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#32:1:A> And you go my focus is fine
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#33:1:A> And then you go <,> whoops <,> sorry <,> they're <}> <-> gonna </->

<+> going to </+> </}> be like hey come on we just lost some time panicking

about the image <,> let's work here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#34:1:A> The next thing you have to do once you get the focus done is you as

a camera assistant must show up on set <,,> with these
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#35:1:A> These are cushions <,> for the eye piece
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#36:1:A> <}> <-> <w> 'Kay </w> </-> <+> okay </+> </}> if you don't show up

on set with these it's like a big sign of disrespect to your camera operator
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#37:1:A> The production should pay for them <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#38:1:A> They cost five dollars apiece
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#39:1:A> I have some left over from another production that <,> you know

I've kept with me in case the next production I go on doesn't have them
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#40:1:A> The reason why you have them is <,> that eye piece is plastic <?>

for one </?> <,> you sweat <,> in a hot room <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#41:1:A> If you're in that eye piece for sixteen hours a day <,> for four

weeks <,> you're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> have a ring of

acne and <{> <[> infection </[>

<$ZZ> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#42:1:Z> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#43:1:A> This you change every day <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#44:1:A> The next thing is <,> if it's cold out and you sweat your eye then

freezes to the plastic <&> audience laughter starts </&> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#45:1:A> And so <,> what happens now is they've actually got <,> <&>

audience laughter stops </&> you put this on and then they've got an electric

heater inside the eye piece now that when it's cold you plug into the camera

<,> and it starts to heat the eye piece <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#46:1:A> But the plastic will still burn the skin <,> all right from the

cold cos it'll freeze so you have to have this on as well

<$ZC> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#47:1:Z> <O> question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#48:1:A> This you can buy at Panavision Moliflex Michel Trudel <,>

wherever you get camera equipment

<$ZB> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#49:1:Z> <O> question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#50:1:A> Ya <,> you take <,> off the lens <,,> and you aim to the

brightest light source
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#51:1:A> If you don't have one <,> the camera assistant and the camera

operator trade back and forth <,> shine a flashlight <,> into the gate
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#52:1:A> Warn the person looking through that it's going to happen cos it

could cause retina burn <,> and then adjust the eye piece <,> accordingly
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#53:1:A> The way you test is go completely out of focus for your eye and

move into focus on the grid inside the eye piece
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#54:1:A> Once that's sharp <,> pass it <,,> then you turn backwards <,,> and

you'll get focused for your eye piece
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#55:1:A> Mark it <,> then let the <,> other person do the same <,,> <O>

short, off-topic exchange with a new speaker </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#56:1:A> That's the same for every camera <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#57:1:A> Okay it's the same mechanism on this <,> this the new ones out <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#58:1:A> It's the same thing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#59:1:A> So then you move to the lenses <O> cough </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#60:1:A> For this camera <,> to load the lenses <,> is very simple
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#61:1:A> Up here is a little tooth
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#62:1:A> I don't know if you can see it <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#63:1:A> A little tooth inside <O> audience murmurs </O> <,,> on the top <O>

audience murmurs </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#64:1:A> Okay <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#65:1:A> <}> <-> <w> 'Kay </w> </-> <+> okay </+> </}> what you do with that

<,,> is there's a hole <,> so male female and you enter <O> audience murmurs

</O> <,,> and that's it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#66:1:A> The lens is installed <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#67:1:A> <}> <-> <w> 'Kay </w> </-> <+> okay </+> </}> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#68:1:A> Now the thing with this is that you could put three lenses on <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#69:1:A> I suggest that if don't <?> need </?> your lenses on make sure the

caps are on even though it is sealed inside
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#70:1:A> It's just better protection <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#71:1:A> So <,,>

<$ZZ> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#72:1:Z> <{> <[> <O> question </O> </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#73:1:A> <[> Okay <}> <-> there's <,,> </[> </{> </-> <=> <}> <-> <.>

th </.> </-> <=> there's </=> </}> </=> </}> <,,> three ways I've seen the

gate being checked
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#74:1:A> Two of them are correct
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#75:1:A> One is <?> from </?> first-year and second-year students who don't

know how which is to take the door off <,> and look in which is <,> you lose

film
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#76:1:A> To check the gate it's the same way to move the registration pin

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#77:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#78:1:A> It moves the shutter <,,> and the pin at the same time <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#79:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#80:1:A> Now there's two ways to check the gate <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#81:1:A> One is to press down on these two <,> buttons here <,> that are all

the way around
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#82:1:A> Each one <}> <-> is </-> <=> <}> <-> it </-> <=> it </=> </}> </=>

</}> loosens <,> the lock
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#83:1:A> Slide it out <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#84:1:A> Move the uh shutter so that you can see the film <,> and there's

your film inside <,> <unclear> maybe three words </unclear> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#85:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#86:1:A> And you can check the gate with a magnifying glass and flashlight
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#87:1:A> There's another way to check the gate <,,> and I use this one

because <,> it's easier to see <,>

<$ZZ> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#88:1:Z> <O> question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#89:1:A> Hair dirt dust
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#90:1:A> But what happens is when you take the lens off frequently <,> you

actually allowing dust in
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#91:1:A> So the fastest <,> and best way to check the gate <,> without a

magnifying glass is to use the magnifying glass which the lens is <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#92:1:A> So you open the lens up all the way <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#93:1:A> Focus at infinity F-stop here T eight <,,> and then <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#94:1:A> I don't know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#95:1:A> I doubt you can see it but <,> if you look at the right angle with

the flashlight <,> you will actually see a magnified version of the plane of

the film
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#96:1:A> And then if you work around each corner <,,> you can see if there's

any dirt in the film
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#97:1:A> You don't have to take anything off the camera <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#98:1:A> You save time and you don't allow dust in

<$ZZ> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#99:1:Z> <O> question </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#100:1:Z> <{> <[> <O> statement </O> </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#101:1:A> <[> It's more accurate <,,> </[> </{>

<&> millimetre </&> frame
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#103:1:A> There's stuff that can be there that you might not see <,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#107:1:A> No you look in the lens <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#108:1:A> And it's <unclear> word </unclear> a magnifying glass and I can

see the entire mechanism <,> perfectly
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#109:1:A> And I can see <,> now the felt <,> already ripping through <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#110:1:A> I mean pulled down

<$ZD> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#112:1:Z> <O> question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#113:1:A> If you look in <,> look at the very top

look </-> <=> to take the lens off </=> </}> on this <,> the first thing you

have to do <,> is loosen <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#183:1:A> <}> <-> <w> 'Kay </w> </-> <+> okay </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#184:1:A> Here this outside ring <,,> you have to loosen it and it says in

which direction
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#185:1:A> It says <mention> loose </mention> <,,> and <mention> fixed

</mention> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#186:1:A> All right <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#187:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#188:1:A> There's no pressure <?> in these </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#189:1:A> Once it's turned it's turned and it's locked
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#190:1:A> So you loosen it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#191:1:A> The next step is to take the lens out <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#192:1:A> You can't do it on the table so I'm <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going

to </+> </}> do it here but I'm going to show you what I'm going to be doing

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#193:1:A> I'm <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> be pressing this

silver button here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#194:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#195:1:A> This silver button here unlocks <,> the teeth that hold onto the

bayonet mount <,> inside
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#196:1:A> It's a different type of lens <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#197:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#198:1:A> So <,> all you do <,> is press this <,,> and it's out
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#199:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#200:1:A> It's a bayonet <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#201:1:A>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#202:1:A> <}> <-> <w> 'Kay </w> </-> <+> okay </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#203:1:A> You <}> <-> gotta </-> <+> have got to </+> </}> get used to a lot

of military terms
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#204:1:A> For some reason <w> that <,> 's </w> come into film but magazines

bayonets <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#205:1:A> Okay and to put it in <,> it's the same thing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#206:1:A> You lock <,> and you close this ring <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#207:1:A> And <,> you're done <,,> and the lens is in
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#208:1:A> It's tight
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#209:1:A> There's no problem
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#210:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#211:1:A> That's how you load <,> the lens in
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#212:1:A> Now if you're using prime lenses on this <,> all you have to do is

take the prime lens out
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#213:1:A> Put it into a new blimp <,,> which looks like <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#214:1:A> But never leave the case <{> <[> by the way <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#215:1:A> No </[>

<$ZC> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#216:1:Z> <[> <O> question </O> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-060#217:1:A> That's not the lens
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#218:1:A> That's a blimp to prevent sound
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#219:1:A> Never leave the case on set or anywhere unlocked <,,> or you will

be kicked off set
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#220:1:A> All right
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#221:1:A> There's just something <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#222:1:A> All you need to do is lock one of them but don't leave them

unlocked <,,> unless it's open <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#223:1:A> Here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#224:1:A> This is the blimp <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#225:1:A> It's to prevent sound
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#226:1:A> This one doesn't work because there isn't a ground glass <,> which

is a clean piece of glass to send the sound back into the camera
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#227:1:A> But you can always take the ground glass from this one and put it

in here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#228:1:A> <}> <-> <w> 'Kay </w> </-> <+> okay </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#229:1:A> Take the ground glass off and turn this knob
<ICE-CAN:S2A-060#230:1:A> Again it says where and <,> how to open it <,> </I>
