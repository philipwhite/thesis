<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-026#1:1:A> And I have to ask Mister Speaker what this says about the kind

of Canada <,> that government envisions
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#2:1:A> What kind of constitution will it be if corporations have rights

such as to pollute the property they own when children have no recognized

rights to health care in this country <&> crowd response, 3 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-026#3:1:A> Surely Mister Speaker our goal for Canada <,> must not simply

be to further the rights of private interests but to further the rights of

Canadian families and to further the public good <&> applause, 10 seconds

</&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-026#4:1:A> <O> French, 1 minute 10 seconds </O> <&> applause, 5 seconds

</&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-026#5:1:A> A constitution Mister Speaker <,> is in a word about freedom

<,,> the rights to equality to recognize diversity the rights of individuals

<,> as enshrined in the charter of individual rights and freedoms <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#6:1:A> But I say Mister Speaker <,> that there is no freedom without public

health care
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#7:1:A> There is no freedom for the worker without a job
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#8:1:A> There is no freedom for the woman without equality
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#9:1:A> There is no freedom for the child without education
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#10:1:A> There is no freedom for the minority without human rights <&>

applause, 15 seconds </&>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-026#11:1:A> A charter of social rights would direct governments to provide

<,> quality health care work toward full employment move society towards

equality provide education for our young and ensure that the human rights of

all are respected <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#12:1:A> A charter of social rights Mister Speaker <,> is about creating

greater freedom
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#13:1:A> Surely that is a goal <,> that all members of this House <,>

embrace
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#14:1:A> Mister Speaker as we enter this remarkable period in our history

<,> the question confronting Canadians is <,> can we agree upon a vision <,>

a vision of this country a destination <,> that we can all share
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#15:1:A> I believe we can do that <,> Mister Speaker
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#16:1:A> Canadians are a caring and a tolerant people
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#17:1:A> We are a people who <,> celebrate the richness of our society and

value the bonds we share
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#18:1:A> We have a history of drawing on each other's strengths <,> and

compensating for each other's weaknesses
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#19:1:A> We have a future <,,> if we choose it <,> of a stronger partnership

a shared prosperity equality <,> and freedom
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#20:1:A> I recently read an article about the opening of ah <,> a new school

in Toronto <,> and during that opening the school choir performed <,,> some

<,,> compositions
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#21:1:A> Seventy-five children from every racial <,> and every cultural

background seventy-five very different children growing up together and

learning to live together <,> and singing together and among the songs they

sang were <,> Dare to Dream <,> and Look Beyond Tomorrow
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#22:1:A> Let us think of these children Mister Speaker as we enter this new

phase <,,> in the development of Canada and of our constitution
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#23:1:A> Let us dare to dream <,> and let us look beyond tomorrow <&>

applause and crowd reaction, 20 seconds </&> <&> tape cuts out </&>

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S2B-026#24:1:Z> <O> Speaker introducing private members' bill before House

</O>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-026#25:1:B> <indig> Monsieur le President </indig> uh <,> this is the

first time I've had the privilege of winning a draw on private members'

business and I was delighted that my uh motion <}> <-> was </-> <=> <,> was

</=> </}> drawn in the uh recent draw and I can <,> now present it to the

House
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#26:1:B> Uh I have a number of items on the order paper <}> <-> in the </->

<=> uh under the </=> </}> uhh private members' business section <,> uh and

I'm pleased to at least have one come forward even if it's uh for a brief

debate <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#27:1:B> I had hoped that perhaps at the end of the hour the government

might allow the motion to pass <,> uh so that we could uh <,> possibly see

some government action <}> <-> on this </-> <=> in this </=> </}> particular

area <}> <-> of <.> wh </.> </-> <=> which </=> </}> I know the government is

in fact considering <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#28:1:B> <}> <-> <.> M </.> </-> <=> Many </=> </}> Canadians Mister Speaker

are unaware of the plight of the Ukrainian-Canadians who were interned during

World War One <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#29:1:B> In fact uh when the war broke out <,> the government said that <,>

Canadian- uh Ukrainians who had immigrated to <,> Canada from the western

Ukrainian territories of Galicia <,> and <}> <-> <.> Buc </.> <.> Bukavee

</.> </-> <=> Bukovina </=> </}> both of which were then part of the

Austro-Hungarian Empire <,> uh were enemy aliens and they posed a threat to

national security <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#30:1:B> Mister Speaker uh the government took the view that this threat

required that these <,> particular persons who were in many cases Canadian

citizens <,> ought to be interned and held in camps for the duration of the

war and accordingly about five thousand <,> Ukrainian-Canadians were in fact

interned by the federal government in twenty-six camps that were located

across Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#31:1:B> One of those camps happened to be in my riding of Kingston and the

Islands <,> and was in the famous old fort there Fort Henry uh which was

built sometime <}> <-> in the nineteenth </-> <=> in the middle of the

nineteenth century </=> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#32:1:B> Approximately eighty-eight thousand others Mister Speaker most of

them uh Ukrainian-Canadians were forced to report regularly to local police

and to internal <,> uh security authorities
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#33:1:B> This uh in spite of the fact that in many cases these persons posed

absolutely no risk uh security or otherwise to the Canadian state <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#34:1:B> I'd like to read a quotation from a book written by Lubomyr Luciuk

a constituent of mine Mister Speaker who's a professor <}> <-> at the </->

<=> uh at </=> </}> Queen's University in the Department of Geography
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#35:1:B> Uh Mister Luciuk uh <,> is a well-known Ukrainian-Canadian <}> <->

and </-> <=> and </=> </}> member of the uh committee that is seeking redress

in this case <,> and he has written a pamphlet called A Time for Atonement uh

subtitled Canada's First National Internment Operations and the

Ukrainian-Canadians Nineteen Fourteen to Nineteen Twenty
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#36:1:B> And I'd like to quote from his book <,> page nineteen
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#37:1:B> <quote> <O> from the mentioned book </O> </quote> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#38:1:B> Again he's quoting
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#39:1:B> <quote> <O> continues from the mentioned book </O> </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#40:1:B> Mister Speaker uh <,> the <}> <-> internment </-> <=> <,>

internment </=> </}> uh went on for a considerable period <,> uh until

nineteen twenty in fact <,> but uh the internment was not the only problem

faced by these <,> citizens
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#41:1:B> In nineteen seventeen uh many members will recall the government at

the time passed <}> <-> the Wartimes Elections Act </-> <=> the Wartime

Elections Act </=> </}> which disenfranchised most Ukrainian-Canadians as

well as many others
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#42:1:B> Uhh uh members will recall that the vote was given to <}> <-> women

of men <}> <-> <.> serv </.> </-> <+> serving </+> </}> </-> <=> uh uh wives

of men serving </=> </}> in the Armed Forces
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#43:1:B> It was also uh taken away from <}> <-> persons of German origin

</-> <=> Canadians of German origin </=> </}> and other uh groups that were

involved in the First World War on the other side
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#44:1:B> It was not <,> an election act of which Canadians can be proud
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#45:1:B> In fact uh frankly it was a national disgrace
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#46:1:B> Uh the government rigged the elections very much in its favour so

that it could win uh the nineteen seventeen election campaign uhm uh which

saw the <}> <-> <.> U </.> </-> <=> Union </=> </}> government as it then was

run and win the election in that year <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#47:1:B> They paid for it in due course as a historical footnote because of

course in nineteen twenty-one uh they were thrown out and replaced with a

very sound administration under <,> the very distinguished and capable

William Lyon MacKenzie King <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#48:1:B> In nineteen eighteen an already censored uh Ukrainian language

press was closed down
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#49:1:B> Uh and this obviously right near the end of the war
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#50:1:B> During the war Ukrainian-Canadians were often maligned in regional

and national newspapers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#51:1:B> They were forced to work as poorly paid labourers in remote areas

and were often relocated away from their homes and their families <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#52:1:B> Those imprisoned had their <}> <-> <.> prof </.> </-> <=> property

</=> </}> confiscated as I've already indicated
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#53:1:B> Some committed suicide while they were imprisoned
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#54:1:B> And some were killed in unsuccessful escape attempts
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#55:1:B> When the war ended a large number <}> <-> of the </-> <=> uh of the

</=> </}> Ukrainian-Canadians were still interned and the government changed

their status from that of enemy alien to Bolshevik and kept them locked up

<,> for fear that they might be sympathetic with the new <,> communist regime

in the Soviet Union
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#56:1:B> And not until nineteen twenty were the camps <,> finally closed

down
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#57:1:B> There was never any evidence presented in any public place <}> <->

that <.> ex </.> </-> <=> that the </=> </}> Ukrainian-Canadians posed a

threat to national security and indeed the government never produced any

evidence to that effect at all
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#58:1:B> Indeed in January nineteen fifteen the British Foreign Office

informed the federal government that Ukrainian-Canadians should be treated as

<,> friendly aliens
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#59:1:B> The government was told that many Ukrainians like other

nationalities within the Austro-Hungarian Empire were opposed to

Austro-Hungarian rule and would not therefore be sympathetic <}> <-> with

</-> <=> with </=> </}> Canada's enemy <,> in the war
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#60:1:B> The motion that I have put before the House <,> is one that is

supported <,> by the Ukrainian Canadian Committee
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#61:1:B> That committee wishes the government to formally acknowledge the

unjust and unwarranted treatment that these persons received during the First

World War
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#62:1:B> They would like to have the event commemorated by having historical

markers established at the various internment sites including at Fort Henry

in Kingston which was the first site used as an internment camp
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#63:1:B> I should also note as an historical footnote that the same fort was

used during World War Two <,> to house prisoners of war <,> and indeed the

International Red Cross uh made statements concerning its use <}> <-> as a

</-> <=> as a </=> </}> prisoner of war camp that it was not a suitable place

to house prisoners so one can only imagine uh what the condition was uh

during the First World War when no international organization apparently was

involved in checking on the internees
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#64:1:B> The Ukrainian Canadian Committee has asked the firm of Price

Waterhouse to compile a study on the financial losses of the internees
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#65:1:B> The report is due later this autumn and once it is complete the

committee would like to discuss the matter of redress with the government <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#66:1:B> The treatment of Japanese <}> <-> <.> Canadian </.> </-> <=> <,>

Canadians </=> </}> who were interned during World War Two has clearly

established some kind of precedent
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#67:1:B> However uh it's certainly clear that given the <}> <-> <}> <-> <.>

ma </.> </-> <+> many </+> </}> </-> <=> <,> number </=> </}> of years that

have elapsed since this internment took place very few if any of the

internees must still be alive <,> and accordingly the committee is not

seeking a redress on an individual basis but rather in the establishment of a

trust <,> uh fund for the Ukrainian community in Canada which could be used

for various purposes of that community <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#68:1:B> Uh <}> <-> Mister </-> <=> uh Madame </=> </}> Speaker the purpose

of the motion that I have put before the House <,> is to urge the government

to look at the facts look at the record and see if something cannot be done

that would in some way <,,> commemorate <,> the evil that was perpetrated by

our country on these people at that time
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#69:1:B> These were innocent citizens of our country who were never

convicted of any crime <,> who just happened to come from an area with which

Canada was at war
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#70:1:B> Because of that <,> they were deemed uh <,> unsuitable to <,> carry

on their daily lives on their farms and their homes wherever they happened to

live in Canada were rounded up and herded into these camps <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#71:1:B> They were separated from their friends from their families from

their communities and held far longer than was necessary solely uh because

the government perceived there may be a security risk to our country because

of the fact they came from that particular part of Europe
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#72:1:B> With great respect uh <,> it is clearly a situation that calls for

some kind of relief
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#73:1:B> Uh I'm not suggesting as I indicated earlier that payments be made

to individuals and neither is the Ukrainian Canadian Committee
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#74:1:B> The committee seeks redress for the community and seeks to have the

fact of this internment commemorated in plaques at the various locations

across Canada where these internments took place
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#75:1:B> In closing perhaps I could quote uh my uh friend Mister Luciuk and

Bohdan Kordan both members of the Ukrainian Canadian community <,> uh when

they published an article in the Kingston Whig-Standard <&> newspaper </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#76:1:B> The uh article I think uhh summarized at least the views of their

community and they wrote as follows
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#77:1:B> <O> quote from previously mentioned newspaper </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#78:1:B> Madame Speaker I know that the government is sympathetic to the

plight of these people uh or to the plight that they suffered <}> <-> in any

</-> <=> in any </=> </}> event these many years ago
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#79:1:B> I know that the government is considering moving on this issue
<ICE-CAN:S2B-026#80:1:B> I urge them to take the matter in hand <,> handle it with dispatch

<,> and seek to come to an arrangement that is satisfactory <,> to ensure

that the fact that this type of thing went on in our country is not forgotten

but is indeed commemorated <,> uh perhaps as a sad reminder of how sometimes

we fall off our notions of fairness and equity and justice which we so often

take for granted in Canada today </I>
