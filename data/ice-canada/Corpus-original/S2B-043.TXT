<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-043#1:1:A> It has been argued that this development of feminist Geography

parallels developments in other humanist geographic research such as Marxist

<,> and <,> <?> phenomenological </?> studies <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#2:1:A> As <unclear> two words </unclear> although the content of the

questions <?> asked differs <?> in these disciplines <,> researchers who <?>

asked about </?> social <unclear> word </unclear> about class relations and

about social meaning in human action experience a similar process of emerging

dissatisfaction with the capacity of a given disciplinary framework's comfort

handling their questions and the changes which inspired them
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#3:1:A> The debates among human geographers questioned the definition of

Geography as a <}> <-> <.> so </.> </-> <=> solely </=> </}> spatial science

and reintroduced human environmental relations as essential concerns <?> of

the discipline </?> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#4:1:A> <unclear> word </unclear> feminist geographers in the United States

in Canada and in Great Britain concur that feminism did come later to

Geography than to other social sciences <,> and that its influence has been

both remarkably negligible and <unclear> word </unclear> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#5:1:A> But few of these theorists questioned why it was that the

theoretical and empirical achievements of feminism have been almost

completely ignored in Geography
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#6:1:A> I suggest that feminism has not succeeded in significantly

influencing traditional geographic thought because of the singularly

androcentric <,> that is male-dominated or male-centred nature of the

discipline
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#7:1:A> Now male dominance is neither specific to Geography <?> nor to other

</?> <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#8:1:A> It pervades all society <,> and as such it is reflected in our

institutions
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#9:1:A> But perhaps male dominance is especially prevalent in Geography <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#10:1:A> <?> Jenna Martin </?> and </?> Susan Manson </?> briefly considered

the reasons for the <}> <-> <.> me </.> </-> <=> meagre </=> </}> <unclear>

word </unclear> feminism in Geography and they conclude that the answer lies

in the <unclear> word </unclear> number of women in the discipline

historically
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#11:1:A> They say <,> <quote> the number of women involved in generating

knowledge in a given discipline appears to be important in determining the

degree to which feminism is absorbed in <?> a specific academic </?> research

institution </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#12:1:A> As all knowledge is a social creation it reflects the conditions

out of which it is produced and <?> transmitted </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#13:1:A> Geographic knowledge and theory <unclear> a few words </unclear>

with men's knowledge and theory and <unclear> word </unclear> men who have

defined its focuses and interests have defined the fields the areas and the

acceptable lines of study and research
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#14:1:A> It is true that historically the discipline of Geography in Britain

in the United States and in Canada is a male-dominated profession
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#15:1:A> Although <unclear> word </unclear> students are equally represented

at undergraduate levels men are predominant <unclear> maybe three words

</unclear> especially on the physical side of the discipline
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#16:1:A> And of the few female students who do enter the graduate levels the

attrition level is high
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#17:1:A> One study from the United States shows that feminist or female

graduate Geography students not necessarily feminists have <unclear> word

</unclear> the highest uh attrition rate of all the social sciences
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#18:1:A> In fact some recent statistics published in nineteen eighty-nine in

Ontario show that Geography is the most male-dominated social science
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#19:1:A> There are fewer women at the Masters P H D and <unclear> word

</unclear> levels in Geography than in any other social science including

what I would consider traditionally male bastions of economics law and

political science
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#20:1:A> To <?> give an <?> example closer to home I'm the only female of

the <?> seven </?> first-year <}> <-> P H D <.> stud </.> </-> <=> P H D

students </=> </}> in Geography here at <@> Dean's </@> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#21:1:A> But the male-dominated nature of the discipline as suggested by <?>

Susan Manson </?> is not a sufficient explanation of the meagre <}> <-> <.>

im </.> </-> <=> impact </=> </}> of feminism in Geography
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#22:1:A> We need to take one step backward and ask why there are so few <?>

females </?> in Geography <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#23:1:A> I argue that it <}> <-> is </-> <=> is </=> </}> related to the

nature of the discipline of Geography which is inherently androcentric <,>

and in sharp conflict with the nature of feminism
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#24:1:A> In fact nearly all of the human <?> Geography </?> <unclear> maybe

two words </unclear> has been a study of the <unclear> word </unclear> world

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#25:1:A> Geography like any other discipline is a product of its times
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#26:1:A> The origins of Western Geography penetrates back to the ancient

Greeks in the fifth and fourth century B C <,> where the first <?>

philosophers </?> the Ionians including <unclear> a few words </unclear> and

so on first began to ask questions with the shape and origin of the Earth
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#27:1:A> It's interesting that the first philosophy which emerged from the

West was the philosophy of nature <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#28:1:A> Their aim was to create a man-made philosophy which could explain

and control the <?> whims and irrationality </?> of nature <unclear> word

</unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#29:1:A> Women were excluded from the ranks of these philosophers and

<unclear> phrase </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#30:1:A> Although Geography is currently divided into the human Geography

and physical Geography the emergence of Geography initially from a physical

science that is <}> <-> Geography </-> <=> or Geology </=> </}> uh the study

of the Earth's surface is significant <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#31:1:A> This may partially explain why Geography has traditionally been

more male-dominated than other social sciences as hard physical sciences have

historically been seen as a male endeavour and it may partially explain why

it traditionally <?> stresses <?> the landscape a landscape which is formed

and <?> interpreted </?> by the male gaze <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#32:1:A> <unclear> a few words </unclear> described this role of the male

gaze in shaping the landscape
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#33:1:A> She interpreted the European occupation of the <unclear> word

</unclear> in the United States personified in the female body in overtly

sexual terms <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#34:1:A> The association that was prevalent in ancient Greece of women with

the private sphere and men with the public has continued in Western <?> minds

</?> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#35:1:A> As geographers throughout history have traditionally been men it is

understandable how Geography <}> <-> has <.> pro </.> </-> <=> has focused

predominantly </=> </}> on public that is male spaces
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#36:1:A> Hence it is not surprising that in <?> those </?> places on the

Earth where we could see the greatest interaction between man and his

environment such as the ancient Greek <}> <-> adore </-> <=> agora </=> </}>

or in contemporary urban areas it is evident that in these places they have

been constructed by and for men <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#37:1:A> As women have been associated with private spaces they have

relatively little opportunity to modify the landscape traditionally studied

by geographers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#38:1:A> As Linda McDowell notes <quote> geographers unlike sociologists

usually exclude the small scale and the <unclear> word </unclear> for

consideration ignoring the material world the social and spatial

relationships that take place within buildings </quote> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#39:1:A> <O> quote continues </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#40:1:A> McDowell is <}> <-> an </-> <=> an </=> </}> example of urban

Geography <}> <-> which is </-> <=> which has </=> </}> traditionally

considered the production of the built environment the distribution of the

urban space how households gain access to certain types of housing in

particular parts of towns and cities but they stop at the front door <,> and

they ignore questions about the sexual division of labour within the home or

the structural <unclear> word </unclear> relations within the households
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#41:1:A> Thus Geography's emphasis on large scale and macro processes

provides another reason for the degree to which Geography has remained

remarkably untouched by feminist theory <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#42:1:A> As Lloyd suggests <}> <-> <.> Geo </.> </-> <=> geographers </=>

</}> might consider the <unclear> word </unclear> <,,> uh of interiors as

expressions of a culture reflecting women's activities but <,> it is

important to <,> realize that this women's culture is <unclear> word

</unclear> in a predominantly male architecture and design
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#43:1:A> In this paper I've attempted to understand the reasons behind

Geography's reluctance to adopt feminist insights as this will provide a

stronger vantage point from which to <}> <-> <.> ta </.> </-> <=> tackle </=>

</}> its historically androcentric nature <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#44:1:A> This nature of Geography explains why feminism was <unclear> word

</unclear> to Geography and why feminist Geography and insights <}> <-> in

</-> <=> of </=> </}> feminist theory in general are so little known by

geographers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#45:1:A> Feminist Geography provides a direct challenge to this

androcentricity
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#46:1:A> <?> It's to <?> admit the gender bias of traditional geographic

theory and to transform radically the structure of our knowledge of reality

and our obsession <?> of states of things </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#47:1:A> This discussion also contributes to the current debate of whether

feminist theory and researching should be added as one thread among many

within human Geography or whether a feminist perspective might be developed

within all the subdivisions of human Geography <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#48:1:A> I see <}> <-> <.> Geo </.> </-> <=> feminist Geography </=> </}>

now as fitting into Helene Cixous's framework of binary oppositions <,> where

feminist Geography is in an unprivileged position to traditional that is

non-feminist Geography <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#49:1:A> Cixous who posits <indig> &eacute;criture f&eacute;minine </indig>

as a solution to male discourse would have undoubtedly argued that feminist

Geography should remain as a separate <?> endeavour </?>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#50:1:A> <?> Linda Peet </?> argues that feminist Geography as a separate

specialist course on feminist Geography would combat continuing sexism and

encourage female students to <?> sit in </?> the academic environment <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#51:1:A> This would <unclear> word </unclear> <?> to initiate <?> a

practical challenge to the male-dominated <unclear> a few words </unclear> of

academia since as </?> Morgan <}> <-> Hanson </-> <=> Hanson </=> </}> </?>

has argued <quote> the more women are involved in the dissemination of

knowledge the greater degree to which feminism is likely to be appropriated

<unclear> word </unclear> research processes </quote> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#52:1:A> But an integrationist approach would also combat sexism and it

would also encourage more women to go into Geography
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#53:1:A> I argue that the inherently androcentric nature of Geography

indicates that it is vital for Geography to wholeheartedly adopt feminist <}>

<-> <.> insig </.> </-> <=> insights </=> </}> within all of human Geography
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#54:1:A> If feminist Geography remains as a separate and marginalized

subdiscipline it will present a weaker challenge to the highly androcentric

nature of Geography
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#55:1:A> Thus I advocate a feminist perspective within all streams of human

Geography as feminism has the potential to radically transform the entire

discipline of Geography as well as all of its attending theories

methodologies and <unclear> word </unclear> <,,> <&> applause </&> <O>

although theories about the role of the reader and the subjectivity of the

reading process abound to date there have been few controlled studies within

reader response circles which actually test reception theories
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#66:2:A> In fact <,> few reader response scholars have provided the

community with any significant empirical data to date <,> to back up their

various hypotheses or to justify the conclusions they draw of what readers

<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#67:2:A> Reader Response to <@> a Few Great Books </@> the Empirical <@>

Study Book </@> a collection of original essays I've edited for <@> Burton de

Gravel </@> in the series <@> Approaches to Literature </@> aims to fill this

texts
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#68:2:A> Its contributors scholars from around the world reveal in this book

the degree to which expert and non-expert readers use literary devices and

reading strategies to make their judgements and propose interpretations
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#69:2:A> By supplying us with some sought after hard facts <,> these

scholars advance our understanding of the nature role and importance of

textual levels and codes interpretive strategies and socio-historical

determinacy
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#70:2:A> They do so by applying theories and techniques from many

disciplines to concrete examples and reproducible experiments
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#71:2:A> The results of their empirical studies suggest <,> that text counts

that interpretive strategy counts <,> and that culture counts
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#72:2:A> On several levels and to varying degrees their research indicates

that what we read <,> how we read and who we are all determine meaning
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#73:2:A> Their empirical studies of the way ordinary readers read may also

help us understand how expert readers read <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#74:2:A> For instance <,> and this I refer to part one of <}> <-> the </->

are actually based on real and measurable criteria one can then suppose that

literary critics also base their interpretations of text on definable and

<ICE-CAN:S2B-043#75:2:A> In the same way and this I refer to the second half <@> Reduction
