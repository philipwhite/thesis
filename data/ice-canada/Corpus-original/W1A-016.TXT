<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-016#1:1> The role of women in <ul> A Fringe of Leaves </ul> , is described

as being <}> <-> dependant </-> <+> dependent </+> </}> on the men of their

society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#2:1> Women, like Ellen, are icons in the society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#3:1> They are nothing more than show pieces to the men who 'care' for them.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#4:1> <ul> A Fringe of Leaves </ul> is primarily a novel constructed around

the development of the individual natural character of a woman once she is

free from the constraints of her society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#5:1> By the end of the novel Ellen has become in touch with her primitive

sexual nature but then must, again, enter back into her role that had

originally been set out for her. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-016#6:1> Moving to London from the Caribbean <quote> was their first lesson

in cities </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#7:1> It is also their first lesson in Western European society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#8:1> " A Wedding in Spring" deals primarily with the attempt to become "

Western" and to fit into the ways and lifestyles of the British.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#9:1> Attempting to integrate into this Western society is fully established

with the actual wedding.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#10:1> However, trying to make this transition becomes awkward.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#11:1> It proves difficult, if not impossible, to hold a traditional 'white'

wedding for the people of Caribbean <del> descent </del> background that also

try to hold on to some of their past culture without disrupting their newly

found lifestyle. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-016#12:1> Fada, in <ul> Master of the Ghost Dreaming </ul> has an

interesting role.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#13:1> It is one <del> of </del> that fulfills <del> <unclear> unclear word

</unclear> </del> a paternalistic image, as well as one of leadership.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#14:1> He is the white 'ruler' of this small island of aboriginal people who

have been severely <del> rep </del> oppressed by the onset of colonization in

Australia.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#15:1> However, he is not of superior intellectual power to these people,

particularly to <}> <-> Ludjee </-> <+> Ludgee </+> </}> and <}> <->

Jangamuttak </-> <+> Jangamuttuk </+> </}> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#16:1> These two characters are superior to Fada as they are in control of

their dreaming.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#17:1> They are capable of making the transition between reality and

dreaming.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#18:1> Fada is inferior because he does not understand the powers of

dreaming, nor does he understand its significant presence in the spiritual

world of the aboriginal people.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#19:1> <}> <-> Ludjee </-> <+> Ludgee </+> </}> and <}> <-> Jangamuttak </->

<+> Jangamuttuk </+> </}> both appease Fada and make him believe that he is

superior to them while all along <del> he is </del> they are working towards

removing his presence from the island which they do eventually accomplish.

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-016#20:1> Dr. Bridget is a superior Doctor in <ul> Of Customs and Excise

</ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#21:1> However, she has returned to India after being in England for most of

her life and <del> she <.> a </.> </del> does not understand the Hindu

culture as much as she thinks she does.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#22:1> She, at first, believes Dr. Naigar to be a harsh woman that is quite

primitive in many of her medical practices.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#23:1> Later, Dr. Bridget learns that it is not all important to know just

medicine but it is equally important to be in touch with the culture of the

people you are helping.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#24:1> When Parvati comes into the clinic with her mother-in-law to find out

how far along she is in her pregnancy, Dr. Bridget learns quickly that she

must lie, because Parvati's pregnancy is further along than her <}> <->

marraige </-> <+> marriage </+> </}> , in order to save this young woman's

life.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#25:1> Hinduism is a harsh culture in which the women are completely

subservient to their husbands.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#26:1> Sex is a sin that would be paid for by death if it is discovered to

have taken place outside of <}> <-> marraige </-> <+> marriage </+> </}> .

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-016#27:1> Lawson's image of women in his version of " The Drover's Wife" is

very much exemplified by this quote.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#28:1> <del> She <.> sur </.> </del> The Drover's Wife survives in this

version.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#29:1> She is seen as the idealistic woman who is considered somewhat of a

heroine because she goes outside of the female role in order to save her

family.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#30:1> However, Lawson also maintains her sense of being the weaker sex as

well.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#31:1> Tommy is old enough to be <quote> amused </quote> by his mother.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#32:1> He is socialized enough to be aware of the separation between men's

and woman's roles.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#33:1> He no longer considers his Mom as his hero, but rather, now,

considers her as his equal.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#34:1> The younger child still depends on his Mom to be the 'hero', he has

yet to learn these gender roles in society. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-016#35:1> This poem, and these lines, tell the tale of a lost culture that

now belongs in a museum.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#36:1> The imposition of colonialism has covered over this culture.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#37:1> Now, it stands, isolated, in a museum to be mocked at.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#38:1> The colonial attitude of being superior to the culture which they

were attempting to destroy was their saving grace.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#39:1> This feeling of superiority had to be maintained in order to feel

morally right in 'civilizing' the savages.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#40:1> The cultures of the aboriginal people must learn how to survive time

by, perhaps, learning the trick of quietly being <}> <-> perserved </-> <+>

preserved </+> </}> , then quietly unfolding and being culturally reactivated

when the time is right. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-016#41:1> Ellen Roxburgh in <ul> A Fringe of Leaves </ul> and <del> the

</del> many of the women in Of <ul> Customs and Excise </ul> are depicted as

profoundly different than the men which surround them.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#42:1> <del> Both </del> In both works the women are forced to move away

from what they realize as the woman's place in society and to look back and

either change themselves to become enlightened unto the fact that they are

individuals apart from their men or to realize their roles in life are as

important as the men's and to maintain the restraints of the social structure

is their priority.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#43:1> Ellen's journey, specifically, is one that consist primarily of

discovering her primitive sexual nature.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#44:1> Maya, too, in <ul> Of Customs and Excise </ul> is able to discover

her blatantly sexual side.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#45:1> However, many of the other women in <ul> Of Customs and Excise </ul>

are aware that they must uphold their traditional roles in society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#46:1> Parvati, in particular, is an interesting character because in her

youth she had gone against her rigid social structure and had sexual

relations outside of her <}> <-> marraige </-> <+> marriage </+> </}> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#47:1> She suffers immensely for this act because she becomes pregnant as a

result of this affair and, therefore, pays the price the rest of her life.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#48:1> Her husband is unkind to her and to her daughter Maya.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#49:1> Parvati gives up her own freedom in order to give her daughter a

chance that she, herself, never had. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-016#50:1> Generally, the women are seen as much different than the men in

these two works because they are identified in regards to the men which

surround them.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#51:1> They live in a purely paternalistic world which, in itself, offers no

freedom to these women.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#52:1> The men, in contrast, are able to characterize themselves.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#53:1> In other words they stand alone in their social context.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#54:1> For example Austin Roxborough is a separate entity <del> , but </del>

in his society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#55:1> He is an individual man, a scholar, a man of high regard.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#56:1> Whereas, his wife, Ellen, <del> is </del> seen as his wife, is also

seen of high social stature because Austin is successful and <del> not

because she is </del> Ellen is Austin's wife.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#57:1> She is his property and is described through his characteristics and

not through her own.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#58:1> Parvati is much in the same position.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#59:1> Her husband is a successful man, therefore, she is seen as

successful.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#60:1> These women do not have an individual description.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#61:1> Ellen is able to escape these <del> circumstances </del> social

restraints for a while due to some extraordinary circumstances, in which she

is captured by an aboriginal group after a shipwreck and is eventually lead

back to civilization by a convict named Jack Chance.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#62:1> It is ironic, that she is capable of finding an individual identity

in a savage land amongst savage men.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#63:1> Although her western world is more civilized in <del> one </del> some

respects, it did not allow her the chance to completely know herself.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#64:1> Of course, as <del> this </del> <ul> A Fringe of Leaves </ul> tends

to be more of a sexual journey than anything else, it does take a man, Jack

Chance, for her to become in touch with her sexual side.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#65:1> She is once again, identified in relationship to a man.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#66:1> However, the important thing IS that he is outside of her social

realm and <del> is therefore </del> would be considered by her world as a

savage.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#67:1> He is more civilized to her than her very civilized husband Austin.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#68:1> It is interesting that Austin had always treated her as an object

while Jack is capable of loving her as a woman, regardless of society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#69:1> In fact, there are no societal constraints in <del> <unclear> unclear

word </unclear> </del> the relationship between Jack Chance and Ellen.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#70:1> This is, perhaps, where the only difference lies. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-016#71:1> Maya, is also given freedom to a certain extent.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#72:1> Her mother Parvati gives her an exit to the oppressive paternalistic

Hindu society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#73:1> Parvati shoves money under Maya's door one evening giving her a way

to move away from the home and to go to school.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#74:1> The modern Canadian society which Maya finds herself in, is much more

accepting than the traditional Hindu household that she had grown up in.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#75:1> Like the other women, Maya had been described in terms of her Father

and not in terms of herself.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#76:1> Maya is in a difficult situation in that she is <del> <.> betw </.>

</del> caught between two worlds, between the paternalistic oppressive Hindu

world and the western Canadian world.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#77:1> Her friends are Canadians who offer her a picture of the life she

could have if she could escape her Father.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#78:1> Parvati loves her daughter so much and believes her daughter should

have the chance to be defined on her own, and in her own terms.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#79:1> Maya takes this opportunity and for a while completely disregards her

culture.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#80:1> However, she realizes how much her mother has been through and, in

the end, goes back <del> in <.> t </.> </del> to comfort her, and to hold her

<del> when </del> even though she couldn't earlier, when she was still in

Parvati's womb. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-016#81:1> These women, although with very different circumstances, are all

restrained because they live in a very paternalistic society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#82:1> The women in <ul> For Customs and Excise </ul> are particularly

related to their ability to have male children.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#83:1> Their value is based completely on this ability.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#84:1> Ellen Roxborough is, <del> also </del> defined in regards to her

husband's position in society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#85:1> Women basically are of no value on their own.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#86:1> Although they learn to outgrow their roles or to sink into them, they

never are able, to <del> completely able to </del> find an identity to

themselves without the interference of men.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#87:1> Perhaps the most positive image is of Maya, who, after much personal

suffering, is able to bridge the waters between her traditional <}> <-> hindu

</-> <+> Hindu </+> </}> culture, in order to help her Mother, and her new

found Western existence. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#88:1> <h> <ul> Close-UP </ul> : </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-016#89:1> This poem provides the image of a Western woman in the midst of a

newly colonized country.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#90:1> The <quote> sunhat </quote> , a proper European piece of wardrobe is

seemingly protecting her from the harsh new world sun which she is not yet

used or does not wish to become used <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear>

</del> to.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#91:1> The storm which approaches may be representative of the ideal of

colonialism, as an oppressive force, just as the storm itself is able to

possess the land without much warning, so does colonialism possess the land.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#92:1> This woman is apparently struggling with the <}> <-> barreness </->

<+> barrenness </+> </}> <del> and </del> of the land.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#93:1> It conflicts with her because it is uncivilized like her.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#94:1> She is attempting to overcome its hostility.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#95:1> Although she is pulled in two different directions: her <quote> white

roots </quote> are at her feet, symbolizing the land that she has left

behind.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#96:1> She has, in fact, uprooted herself, and the <quote> overhanging

tussock" cuts her hands </quote> , symbolizes the violence of the new land

which she has entered.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#97:1> <del> The </del> Her body image is important, she is being pulled and

stretched between two lands.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#98:1> The last line is significant in that she holds onto her past Western

views in this untamed land.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#99:1> She is attempting a most cultured task, painting, in the mostly

unlikely place.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#100:1> It seems futile for her to attempt to paint the <del> <unclear>

unclear word </unclear> </del> untouched landscape, yet, in another sense in

it obviously very important to her <del> to </del> or else she wouldn't go

through such a lot of work to make it possible.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#101:1> She is, therefore, unwilling to give up her civilized lifestyle in

order to fit into this uncivilized world.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#102:1> <del> She is </del> The image of this woman greatly contrasts that

of her immediate surroundings.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-016#103:1> She seems as the <}> <-> violater </-> <+> violator </+> </}> of the

land in the poem, and not as the violated. </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-016#104:2> The decay of the veteran should mark the decay of loyalty to the

British Empire so that the West Indies can build their own nationalist

feeling and identity. <O> end of paragraph <O> </p> </I>
