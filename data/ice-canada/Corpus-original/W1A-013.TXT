<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-013#8:1> The author is Milton.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#9:1> It is from <del> the <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> Lycidas.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#10:1> which is a reflection on his friends death.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#11:1> Milton is questioning the working of God as insensitive and uncaring.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#12:1> <del> The </del> Like the confused army which ends up killing each

other Milton wonders why God has killed his companion. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-013#13:1> The author is William Wordsworth from <ul> The Preface to Lyrical

Ballads </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#14:1> Wordsworth explains that poetry is not spontaneous creation but the

result of a quiet reflection on a past experience remembered in a <?> moment

</?> of tranquility. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-013#15:1> The author is William Shakespeare from <ul> The Tempest </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#16:1> These lines are said by Ariel who is explaining that all the people

on the island are changing who they are, or they are discovering who they

truly are.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#17:1> The are changing from their perceived self to the <del> honest </del>

self they really are, <quote> something rich and strange </quote> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-013#18:1> The Author is John Donne. The lines are from <ul> The Flea </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#19:1> The narrator is trying to convince a woman to have sex with him and

he compares their love making to a bite of a Flea.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#20:1> Donne uses a metaphysical conceit to compare a Flea, to lovemaking,

the <?> church </?> and marriage.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#21:1> In this way he tries to make her loss of virginity as nothing more

trivial than a flea bite. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-013#22:1> The Author is Alexander Pope.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#23:1> The lines are drawn from <ul> The Rape of the Lock </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#24:1> Clarissa helps the baron to cut off a Lock of Belinda's hair <del> ,

</del> by giving him the scissors the <quote> two-edged weapon </quote> of

which to cut it.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#25:1> Clarissa is a character which some women side with who do not want to

side with Belinda <del> because </del> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#26:1> In this way it pits women against women and forces them to laugh at

their sex. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-013#27:1> The Author is <del> T.S.Eliott </del> Kate Sterns from <del> <ul>

The Wasteland </ul> </del> <ul> Thinking About Magritte </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#28:1> This is a reflection on how it seems one must travel through the

toughest and worst to get at the best.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#29:1> You must put up with petty annoyances of day to day living before you

are rewarded.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#30:1> As with Maxine her husband Old River was the person she hated most

because he beat her and was mean but she had to move through that because she

remembered who he was and loved him best. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-013#31:1> The author is Christina Rossetti from <ul> The Goblin Market

</ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#32:1> This illustrates the dependence of women on other women.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#33:1> We should always depend on our sisters because they will be the one

thing that sticks by us in times of thick or thin, <quote> calm or stormy

weather </quote> good or bad times. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-013#34:1> The author is Joseph Conrad from <ul> Heart of Darkness </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#35:1> Marlow is explaining that once we <del> are </del> were all like the

savages in the heart of Africa but we have evolved through our culture to

become civilized.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#36:1> It is our culture which gives us language and knowledge therefore the

people in Africa are seen as mindless <del> primitaves </del> primitives.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#37:1> A split between the European belief system and the African. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-013#38:1> A metaphysical conceit is a comparison between <}> <-> to </->

<+> two </+> </}> unlike objects.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#39:1> Unlike a Petrarchan conceit which compares two similar objects on a

basis of physicality and similitude a metaphysical conceit compares two

things in an intellectual way.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#40:1> It compares two dissimilar objects or ideas
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#41:1> John Donne uses a metaphysical conceit in his sonnet " The Flea".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#42:1> In this sonnet Donne compares the flea to love-making, the church,

and marriage.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#43:1> The flea bites both the lover and his conquest and he compares this

to <del> their </del> a marriage because the two of them ( their blood) have

become one ( in the flea).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#44:1> He also compares her killing the flea to love making.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#45:1> It is no greater sin that she lose her virginity than her killing the

flea which Donne also represents as the Church . ( <del> it's </del> its

body).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#46:1> This type of conceit is used to draw an intellectual comparison

between two things.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#47:1> By comparing their love-making or marriage to a flea-bite Donne is

able to make the important seem trivial.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#48:1> It is a way of convincing someone of something by making it seem like

they are not really giving up anything at all.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#49:1> By comparing two dissimilar things is also slightly confusing so as

to <}> <-> acquiese </-> <+> acquiesce </+> </}> to something before actually

knowing what it is. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-013#50:1> Over the many centuries of literature, many different attitudes

towards women and by women have been expressed.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#51:1> Women have travelled from a time of illiteracy and no representation

to an era in which <del> women </del> they are able to assert themselves

freely.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#52:1> These attitude changes are seen in Geoffrey Chaucer's <ul> Wife of

Bath </ul> , Aphra Behn's <ul> Oroonoko </ul> , and Virginia Woolf's <ul> A

Room of One's Own </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#53:1> Through changes in era, authorship and content, are we able to see

how the attitudes about women have changed.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#54:1> Women have travelled from <del> illiteracy </del> a male dominated

patriarchal society to one in which women are able to express their views and

beliefs as freely as men. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-013#55:1> In the middle ages, the time Geoffrey Chaucer wrote the <ul> Wife

of Bath </ul> , women were an illiterate and unrepresented part of society.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#56:1> The women were inferior to the men and were portrayed as such in

literature.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#57:1> In Chaucer's the <ul> Wife of Bath </ul> , the wife of Bath espouses

all the stereotypes held of women.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#58:1> Having five husbands she is seen as the cause of man's downfall.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#59:1> The wife of Bath is fully aware of these stereotypes because her

fifth husband told her of <?> women's </?> manipulation and unworthiness yet

she uses these stereotypes against men in order to lead a life of

independence and promiscuity.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#60:1> However the <ul> Wife of Bath </ul> should not be regarded as a

correct account of women during <del> that </del> the middle ages because it

is written by a man and expresses a man's point of <}> <-> veiw </-> <+> view

</+> </}> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#61:1> Women <del> are still </del> were an illiterate and unrepresented

part of society and therefore unable to write of their plight themselves.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-013#62:1> However, this changed in the Romantic period.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#63:1> As Virginia <}> <-> Woolfe </-> <+> Woolf </+> </}> once said <quote>

we should all lay flowers on the grave of Aphra Behn </quote> because it was

she who first gave women a voice.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#64:1> <ul> Oroonoko </ul> , by Aphra Behn is one of the first novels

written by a woman.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#65:1> Novel writing was one of the first occupations that opened up for

women as acceptable in society, along with motherhood and homemaking <del> (

during the Romantic Period) </del> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#66:1> Women were slowly gaining literacy as well as representation with

women like Aphra Behn.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#67:1> Aphra Behn's story of Oroonoko - an African prince who becomes

alienated by a domination of men and his strive for freedom although it means

his certain death is especially understood by women because for many years

they suffered much of the same alienation and subordination to the male

patriarchy and domination of the eras.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#68:1> Behn portrays that women too, like Oroonoko must strive for their

freedom no matter what the cost.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#69:1> Finally <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> some of these

attitudes of male control were changing <del> to </del> and women, by writing

novels, were able to earn a living for themselves. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-013#70:1> This is one of Virginia <}> <-> Woolfe's </-> <+> Woolf's </+>

</}> arguments in <ul> A room of one's own </ul> written in the nineteenth

century.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#71:1> Women were finally gaining an education as well as representation but

they were still under the forces of patriarchal control.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#72:1> In <ul> A Room of One's Own </ul> the narrator expresses an inability

to enter a library on a college campus without <quote> a letter of

recommendation </quote> from a dean and was unable to <quote> walk on the

grass </quote> unless accompanied by a male.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#73:1> Men, even in this century are trying to control the actions of women.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#74:1> <del> Woolfe </del> Woolf petitions that women need to have a <quote>

room of one's own </quote> and to earn an independent income so that they can

write effectively and efficiently as this way they will not be subject to the

interruptions arriving <?> : </?> in their home from husbands and children.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#75:1> Woolf also petitions that women break the male model of writing to

create a <quote> female sentence </quote> in this way she seems to be asking

to break the male patriarchal control to create a female space in society, a

<quote> room of one's own </quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#76:1> We must be able to live independently and of our own means in order

to break the patriarchal control which has been instilled in society for many

centuries.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#77:1> We must break out of what Joseph Conrad calls <quote> that beautiful

world of their own </quote> which is the <del> place </del> slot men <del>

put </del> designate for women in society, into a <quote> place of one's own

</quote> where women put themselves as an equal part of society, not

inferiors.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#78:1> Virginia Woolf's <ul> A Room of One's Own </ul> can be seen as one of

the first feminist critiques of a still mainly male dominated society; Women

must not be that manx cat looked on as an oddity, but as a normal and <?>

</?> equal </?> part of <del> life </del> society. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-013#79:1> Although many attitudes have changed many still stay the same.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#80:1> Women are still <del> and </del> an underrepresented part of our

society and culture.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#81:1> Many stereotypes of women still exist of women's inferiority to men

and this in turn helps to perpetuate the male patriarchal control over

society and women.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#82:1> Women firstly, must be like the <ul> Wife of Bath </ul> who <del> are

</del> is independent and use the stereotypes against men.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#83:1> <del> And they </del> Secondly, we must be like Aphra Behn's

Oroonoko, who realizes his subordination and alienation and who strives for

freedom no matter what the cost.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#84:1> Finally, we must do as Virginia <del> Woolfe </del> Woolf says and

find a <quote> room of one's own </quote> we must discover what our place in

society is and will be in the future.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#85:1> The attitudes about women and by women have travelled and changed

throughout history and literature and this change is an integral part for

women to gain an equal status and representation. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-013#86:1> The form of this poem is a sonnet.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#87:1> It is a petrarchan sonnet because it consists in form of two

quatrains making up an octave and two <del> sestets </del> tercets making up

a sestet.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#88:1> <del> <?> Its's </?> </del> Its movement moves from a deliberation of

the world in a sad way <del> <.> w </.> </del> in the quatrains to a turning

of mood to one of anger in the tercets. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-013#89:1> The problem is that the world is <quote> too much with us

</quote> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#90:1> The nature of this problem is that mankind has subdued nature to use

it for his own will.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#91:1> We are using something which does not belong to us <quote> Little we

see in nature that is ours </quote> <+> . </+>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#92:1> Man; instead of using their powers to help nature, instead get and

spend it and <quote> lay waste to our <?> power </?> </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#93:1> <quote> We have given our hearts away </quote> <?> </?> nature </?>

and the things nature provides is our <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear>

</del> lifeblood yet we destroy it.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#94:1> The solution the poet offers is that Nature uprise and destroy man.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#95:1> To again take control of what was its to begin with.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#96:1> Proteus and Triton are both Gods of the sea.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#97:1> The sea will lash out against man. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-013#98:1> This poem is unlike the poems of the renaissance in that it does

not compare love to anything.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#99:1> It does not have a tormented lover and a love object but it has a

tormented man and his thoughts of nature which is seen as a feminine thing.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#100:1> As in the renaissance poetry when descriptions are given of the love

objects so is nature described eg. lines 5 and 6.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#101:1> Similarly the man is also forced to compete for the love object so

the narrator of this poem competes with science and technology for <}> <->

natore </-> <+> nature </+> </}> - expresses a love of nature. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-013#102:1> The poem would belong to the Romantic period which ran from 1789

to 1832.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#103:1> The themes and concerns <}> <-> are </-> <+> of </+> </}> this poem

are characteristic of the time period because during the Romantic period was

the rise of Industrialization, science and technology.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-013#104:1> One main concern is of the destruction of nature eg in 3. <O> rest

of paragraph </O> </p> . </I>
