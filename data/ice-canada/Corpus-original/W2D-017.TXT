<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#1:1> <h> <bold> MAKING THE GRADE </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#2:1> <it> by Terry Davis </it>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#3:1> Thirty years from now, when I have a grandchild on each knee, both

eager to hear tall tales, I'll probably tell them about the three days I

spent on Quebec's Ste. Marguerite River in 1989. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#4:1> My tale will begin innocuously enough.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#5:1> I'll tell them that I had just flown back from an unsuccessful trip to

the Kegaska, a pret <l> ty-as-a-picture river on Quebec's lower North Shore,

and that I was a little tired when I climbed into my car, at six in the

morning, for the eight-hour drive from Montreal to Sacre-Coeur. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#6:1> But the sun was out, it was warm, and I was off to fish a river

I'd never seen before.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#7:1> That alone would have been enough to lift my spirits nine times out of

10.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#8:1> On this trip, however, my angling companions were to include Lee and

Joan Wulff, both fly-fishing legends in their own time.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#9:1> My growing happiness was mixed with a little fear and trepidation.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#10:1> Lee has accomplished more with a fly rod than any other angler in

history, and Joan isn't far behind.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#11:1> I would be thrown in with the elite of my recently adopted sport, a

rank amateur casting with the pros. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#12:1> At least that's how I viewed it.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#13:1> I didn't want to be the odd man out in this deal, the only one of our

group not to hook a fish.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#14:1> But given my lack of experience, and the fact that I was still

struggling to perfect some sort of casting technique, I knew this was a

distinct possibility. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#15:1> For the moment, though, being behind the wheel of my car, with my

fly-rod beside me, was enough.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#16:1> And the scenery was great.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#17:1> I'd taken the South Shore route, driv <l> ing from Montreal to Quebec

City, then continuing on to Rivi&egrave;re du Loup.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#18:1> At that point I took a break from driving, crossing over to the upper

North Shore on the ferry to St. Simeon.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#19:1> From there it was just a short hop, via Tadoussac, to the ZEC office

in Sacre-Coeur. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#20:1> In addition to myself and the Wulffs, this trip, organized by the

Quebec government, was to include John <}> <-> Randolpf </-> <+> Randolph

</+> </}> , the editor of <it> Fly Fisherman </it> magazine, Nelson Bryant,

the outdoor columnist for the <it> New York Times </it> , Andr&eacute;

Bellemare and George Gruenefeld, who fulfill the same roles for Quebec's <it>

Le Soleil </it> and Montreal's <it> Gazette </it> respectively, and Jeannot

Ruel, an editor with Quebec's largest outdoor magazine, <it> Sentier,

Chasse-P&ecircumflex;che </it> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#21:1> There were also a number of participants from the Quebec Ministry

of Recreation, Hunting and Fishing ( MLCP), which is responsible for managing

the province's salmon rivers ( under a special arrangement with the federal

government).
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#22:1> Andr&eacute; Boucher, the MLCP's director of public relations would

be our host, aided by Raynald Loiselle, also with the PR depart <l> ment, and

Pierre Fillion. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#23:1> The moving force behind the whole ex <l> pedition, however, was

Lee Wulff.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#24:1> During the 60 or so years that he has fished for Atlantic salmon, Lee

has formed some pret <l> ty strong opinions on how the resource should be

managed, and he wanted to explain some of these ideas to the Quebec angling

community.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#25:1> Having a sort of open forum between representatives from the Quebec

government and the media seemed to be the best way to go. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#26:1> Of course, Lee had another reason for wanting to visit the Ste.

Marguerite.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#27:1> For several years now, the master angler has been trying to win a

sort of bet he's had with the students who attend his Lew Beach, New York,

fly-fishing school.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#28:1> It seems that one of them had trouble believ <l> ing that the hook

Lee was using in a fly-tying demonstration – a number 28 – was big enough to

catch any sort of fish, let alone an Atlantic salmon. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#29:1> Since then, Lee has managed to land a few grilse on similar, tiny

flies, but never a salmon over 10 pounds.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#30:1> And he'd heard that the Ste. Marguerite, which has a num <l> ber of

long, tranquil pools, could be the place to achieve that goal. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#31:1> When I reached Bardsville, where we were quartered for our

three-day stay, I joined a group of people on the bank of Paquet Pool, and

watched an angler work a dry fly over a fish that refused to rise.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#32:1> Listening to the people who sat near me, sharing the warmth of the

afternoon sun, I learned that the river was lower than it had been in the

past 40 years.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#33:1> Still, a couple of fish had been taken that morning. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#34:1> Bardsville proved to be a marvelous place, reminding me of the

private camps I've seen on the Grand Cascapedia.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#35:1> Its clean white cabins are snuggled in a nest of towering pines, and

the river flows gent <l> ly just behind them.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#36:1> Some of the nicest pools on the Ste. Marguerite are located within a

few hundred yards of camp. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#37:1> Later, I would learn that my analogy to the Cascapedia's camps

was not far off.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#38:1> The original Bardsville was built around 1872 by Willis Russell of

Quebec and his partner from Philadelphia, Robert Powell.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#39:1> The two men eventually concluded a deal with a group of Americans,

led by James Grant of New York, who founded the Ste. Mar <l> guerite Salmon

Club in 1886. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#40:1> Back then, Bardsville consisted of a single cabin, one of many

built along the Ste. Marguerite by Powell and Russell.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#41:1> It was common practice for club members and their guests to start a

fishing trip at the club's main camp.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#42:1> Then, after a day's fishing, they would be poled upriver by canoe to

the next cabin, finishing their trip at Bardsville three or four days later.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#43:1> It was, recalls L&eacute;once Defour, who guided Lee when he

fished the Northeast branch, a hard trip in the days before out <l> board

motors came on the scene.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#44:1> He wasn't kidding.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#45:1> Even with outboards, parts of our trip up the Northeast branch were

difficult.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#46:1> There were times when it seemed that the canoe was making no headway

in the fast-flowing water, although the motor was going full out. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#47:1> During dinner, our first night in camp, Lee had a chance to talk

to the group about the Atlantic salmon, and what he believes must be done to

save the species.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#48:1> He's come to the conclusion that salmon should be given game-fish

status by the Canadian govern <l> ment ( see Game-Fish Status a Must, ASJ

1/90), a move that would effectively end the commercial fishery off

Newfoundland.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#49:1> If the government decides, for whatever reason, that it can't stop

the netting, why not ban the commercial harvesting of large salmon?, asks

Lee.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#50:1> Let the commercial fishermen take nothing but grilse ( by regulating

net-mesh size), which would give the remaining, large salmon more chance to

spawn.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#51:1> Maybe, just maybe, a lot of the country's rivers would regain a run

of large fish, which Lee believes are geneti <l> cally superior to grilse.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#52:1> Over the next three days, Lee would return to this theme often,

doing his best to convince us that it would be the best course of action for

the government to follow.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#53:1> We, however, tended to be equally, if not more, interested in Lee's

stories of his fishing ex <l> ploits in Newfoundland, and in his little

number 28 flies. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#54:1> The next morning, I teamed up with John Randolph in section two

of the river.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#55:1> Like many of the salmon streams managed by ZECs, the Ste. Marguerite

is divided into controlled access and unlimited access water.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#56:1> On the controlled stretches of the river, access is limited to one or

two rods per pool, while unlimited access water is open to any number of

anglers ( who are expected to move through a pool on a rotational basis,

allowing everyone a chance to fish).
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#57:1> In both cases, the cost of a day's fishing is often minimal. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#58:1> With the growing popularity of salmon fishing, controlled access

water is highly sought after.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#59:1> Most ZECs, in an effort to ensure that every angler has an equal op

<l> portunity to fish these pools, have developed a lottery reservation

system.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#60:1> In the case of the Ste. Marguerite, a phone-in lottery is held during

the last week in March.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#61:1> On some other rivers, a card lottery is used. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#62:1> John and I, in section two, would be fishing in limited access

water, so we would have a pool more or less to oursel <l> ves.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#63:1> We made a quick stop at pool 28, but, seeing that Andr&eacute;

Boucher and Joan had established themselves there, we con <l> tinued on down

the road to Bras D'Alain. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#64:1> Our guide for the day was R&eacute;mi Gauthier, one of three

Gauthier brothers who are thus employed on the Ste. Marguerite.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#65:1> I was to fish first, as the junior member of the team.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#66:1> Following R&eacute;mi's advice, I selected a black and yellow fly

that Bill Bryson had tied for me in Nova Scotia, and waded into the river.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#67:1> The fly was one of the smallest I had, but it was probably too

big, given the level of the water.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#68:1> I fished it the way I would have in a turbid pool, starting short and

then lengthening my line, even though the fish were easy to see in this

clean, quiet water. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#69:1> Soon, I had gotten as much line out as I was going to, which

wasn't a lot.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#70:1> There was a bit of a wind blowing, the brush along the shore was a

little close, and I was a little unsure of myself.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#71:1> But I was drifting my fly over fish – they just weren't that

interested in it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#72:1> After I'd given Bill's creation a good workout, I turned the pool

over to John, who tied on a little bomber and went to work himself.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#73:1> He's a man that has worked all the kinks out of his casting stroke.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#74:1> Wind, bushes, audience and all, his fly was al <l> ways right where

he wanted it to be, work <l> ing directly over the salmon that lay in the

shade on the far side of the pool. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#75:1> At first, the fish didn't react to John's offering.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#76:1> But he adjusted his casts, drop <l> ping his fly on the water with a

slack line, and letting it float straight downstream.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#77:1> The fish liked this drag-free approach, and it wasn't long before

John was fast to a lively grilse.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#78:1> He landed the fish quickly, enjoying its leaps and runs, and then

released it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#79:1> Prior to this year, anglers in Quebec could only land one salmon

per day on most Gasp&eacute; rivers and on some North Shore streams like the

Ste. Marguerite.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#80:1> John, then, was done fishing for the day.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#81:1> But he stayed at the pool, doing his best to see that I was casting

over fish, and giving me some pointers on fishing the tiny bomb <l> er he'd

lent me. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#82:1> I came close, but I just couldn't get enough line out to put my

fly over the main concentration of salmon.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#83:1> I even fell once, trying to wade out farther into the river. (
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#84:1> Its bottom is rock covered for the most part, and slippery.)
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#85:1> But I wasn't that deep at the time, and didn't go all the way in.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#86:1> After about an hour, R&eacute;mi suggested we get his canoe, and

fish farther down the pool.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#87:1> John, standing on the bank, had seen some good-sized salmon there,

and said more seemed to be coming upriver. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#88:1> The canoe was small, and a little un <l> stable, so I did my

casting from a sitting position.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#89:1> I should have taken a fish, too, but my inexperience proved costly.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#90:1> In one case, I failed to see a small salmon coming after my fly –

being intent on watching a 20-plus pounder that I was fishing over – and I

picked up my line too fast.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#91:1> Then, when I did finally have a grilse rise to sample my of <l>

fering, I had too much slack line out, and didn't get the hook set in time.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#92:1> But it was an exciting morning, if frustrating.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#93:1> I'd had a rise, and I'd fished over a lot of salmon.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-017#94:1> That afternoon, before I headed out for the evening's fish <l> ing,

John gave me a few casting pointers on the lawn outside the res <l> taurant.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-017#95:1> Despite John's expert coaching, and a lot of effort on the part

of R&eacute;mi, who did his utmost to get me into a fish that evening, I

would not take a salmon on the first day. <O> rest of paragraph </O> </p>
