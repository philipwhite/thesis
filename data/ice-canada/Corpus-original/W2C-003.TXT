<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#5:1> Despite what some peo <l> ple think, no elections for a government

of Nunavut are being held in the Eastern Arctic. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-003#6:1> <bold> Iqaluit </bold> , N.W.T.

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#7:1> The Tungavik Federation of Nunavut is electing a new president and

vice-president Feb. 26, and ex <l> ecutive director Thomas Suluk is concerned

people are misinterpreting the issues involved. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#8:1> " This is an election of federation officers only," says Suluk.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-003#9:1> " A lot of peo <l> ple mistakenly believe the election is for a

government of Nunavut." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#10:1> Suluk says the confusion arises because the TFN election follows

closely the recent signing of its land claim. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#11:1> " People are jumping the gun on this," says Suluk.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-003#12:1> " While many of the issues faced by the new president and

vice-president will relate to land claims and self government, this election

itself will not decide division of the territories or representation in a new

ter <l> ritory." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#13:1> Suluk says he's even received enquiries as to where a new Nunavut

capital would be located. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#14:1> He says one of the jobs of any new TFN officers will be

explaining to the public the difference between the organization and the pro

<l> posed territory of the same name ( <mention> Nunavut </mention> is

Inuktitut for <mention> " our land." </mention> ) </p> </I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#18:2> Iqaluit is finding it harder to quit the Baffin Regional Council

than it first thought. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#19:2> The town council voted itself off the regional body Feb. 20 but

councillors were <}> <-> suprised </-> <+> surprised </+> </}> to learn they

didn't have the authority to do so. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-003#20:2> <h> <bold> Iqaluit </bold> , N.W.T. </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#21:2> According to the Regional and Tribal Councils Or <l> dinance

member com <l> munities can only depart after getting two-thirds ap <l>

proval from their municipali <l> ty by plebiscite. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#22:2> " It's creating a lot of com <l> motion right now," says Iqaluit

mayor Yvon Blan <l> chette.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-003#23:2> " But after the dust settles it may be beneficial." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#24:2> Iqaluit's frustration with the regional council's effec <l>

tiveness and the little value it said it gained for member <l> ship dues,

stirred up the debate. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#25:2> Iqaluit is the only tax-based community in the region and

councillors didn't always identify with small town concerns. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#26:2> " The Baffin Regional Council should look at the big picture,"

says Blan <l> chette.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-003#27:2> " I've attended the last three meetings and there was too much atten

<l> tion paid to individual con <l> cerns that would have been better served

by bringing them to regional offices of the territorial government." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#28:2> At the BRC's annual general meeting in January Blanchette was

asked whether Iqaluit was in or out.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-003#29:2> He put the BRC's ques <l> tion to the town's council and got back a

<mention> no </mention> vote. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#30:2> Blanchette had advised that Iqaluit remain in the regional body.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-003#31:2> But he and the council were both <}> <-> suprised </-> <+> surprised

</+> </}> to find, on check <l> ing the regulations, that they had never

left. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#32:2> " I don't think the town will move for a plebiscite now," says

Blanchette.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-003#33:2> " So it looks like we'll be staying in.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-003#34:2> I believe the Baffin Regional Council has work to do and Iqaluit

should be a part of it." </p> </I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#38:3> Banish the offenders, says MLA Red Pedersen ( Kitikmeot West),

rather than the victims of family violence and sexual assault in small

Northern com <l> munities. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#39:3> He told the legislative assembly that too often vic <l> tims are

forced to flee their community to protect their safety or that of their

children. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#40:3> They often face great hardship, while the perpetrator lives

comfor <l> tably in the family home and in the home community. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#41:3> Even when the offender is punished, says Pedersen, a jail

sentence is no deter <l> rent since it's often viewed as a holiday: a free

trip to Yellowknife and free meals. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#42:3> " It's no punishment at all." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#43:3> Instead, Pedersen says, a judge could forbid the of <l> fender to

come within 400 miles of the victim so con <l> tact would be impossible.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-003#44:3> In the North, the offender would be forced to go to another

community. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#45:3> The concept of banish <l> ment is familiar to the Inuit culture,

where ostracism was used as a control within a community. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#46:3> Justice Minister Michael Ballantyne said restraining orders can

be put on peo <l> ple, but they would expire once the sentence is com <l>

plete.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-003#47:3> " I'm not sure the latitude within our justice system presently

allows it," said Ballantyne. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#48:3> MLA Tony Whitford ( Yellowknife South) said in an interview that

he doubts it would be legally possible to banish someone, based on a

precedent set in Saskatchewan. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#49:3> Ballantyne added more education and dialogue should take place at

the broader community level, and not just initiated by the justice system.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#50:3> But Pedersen says action needs to be taken, and quickly. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#51:3> " For who are we being reasonable?
<ICE-CAN:W2C-003#52:3> For the victim or the criminal?" he asked.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-003#53:3> " You say that longer sentences do not solve pro <l> blems yet we are

prepared to sentence the victims of these attacks, the women, to life in

Yellowknife." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#54:3> " Society is unfair to the victim," says Tony Whit <l> ford.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-003#55:3> " I think society goes out of its way to protect peo <l> ple's

rights, but in some cases I think they go too far to protect the rights of

the individual that has commit <l> ted a crime." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#56:3> Ballantyne says there are more resources going into a victims

program this year and he will be looking at new ways to offer victims sup <l>

port, such as counselling for job opportunities and legal recourse. </p> </I>

pond at its Polaris mine on Little Cornwallis Island. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#121:9> A pipeline from the mine is supposed to settle tailings on the

bottom of Garrow Lake, but there have been breaks in it.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-003#122:9> " There have been a series of spills over the years," says Dave

Nickerson, head of the ter <l> ritorial water board. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#123:9> Garrow Lake has stable levels of water that do not cycle

<ICE-CAN:W2C-003#124:9> The pipe was designed to bring the tail <l> ings to the lake bottom

where they would stay.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-003#125:9> But the breaks have led to higher levels of heavy metals close to

surface than the water board is prepared to allow. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#126:9> The water board wanted Cominco to install a better system for

monitoring the distribution of tailings, but the company balked at the

prospect. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-003#127:9> Now Cominco is challenging in federal ap <l> peals court the

water board's right to regulate its activity. </p>

impose dif <l> ferent contamination stan <l> dards than those required by the
