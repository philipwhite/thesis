<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#1:1> <h> <bold> PCs take aim at slumlords in revised bill </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#2:1> By Donald Campbell </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#3:1> The Filmon government introduced new housing legislation yesterday

to give it tougher powers to fight slum landlords and reform the manner in

which landlord-tenant disputes are settled. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#4:1> The bill is a fine-tuned, but largely unchanged, version of a

similar bill withdrawn earlier this year by the Tory minority government

after a lobby by influential businessmen, including a landlords association

and the Winnipeg Real Estate Board. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#5:1> The legislation, known as Bill 13, gives the province broader

powers to take action against slum landlords by collecting rents from an

entire building to be used to carry out repairs. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#6:1> It also creates a Residential Tenancies Branch to deal with

landlord-tenant disputes and establishes a three-member commission to hear

appeals. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#7:1> The operation of the branch and the commission would be monitored

by a new advisory committee with representation from landlords and tenants.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#8:1> There were widespread fears by tenants groups and anti-poverty

fighters that the bill would be gutted to favor the <w> landlords' </w>

concerns and rammed through the house under the new Tory majority. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#9:1> While both sides of the debate were digesting the contents of the

119-page bill yesterday, they said they were happy with their first

impressions. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#10:1> " I don't think we've taken out anything substantial from the

bill," said Urban Affairs Minister Gerry Ducharme.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#11:1> " We think it is very progressive legislation and something that both

landlords and tenants can live with." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#12:1> If there was a major change, it occurred in the provisions

allowing the government to appoint a receiver to carry out repairs to a

rundown apartment. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#13:1> Under the previously proposed bill, tenants were allowed to

request the appointment of a receiver-manager to act on their behalf. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#14:1> The manager-receiver was to <}> <-> he </-> <+> be </+> </}>

given sweeping powers to oversee repairs. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#15:1> A lien was to be placed on the property giving the province, not

the mortgage holder, the first right to recover the costs. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#16:1> Under the newly proposed law, a tenant still has the right to

request a receiver-manager be appointed to carry out repairs. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#17:1> However, the courts must determine if an institution holding a

mortgage against the property is unwilling <quote> " within a reasonable

period of time" </quote> to carry out the repairs. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#18:1> Also, the cost of the repairs must take into account the

estimated revenue earned from the building over a six-month period. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#19:1> NDP housing critic Doug Martindale, who has previously headed the

Winnipeg Housing Concerns Group, said the change was won by the landlords <}>

<-> throught </-> <+> through </+> </}> pressure on the Tories. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#20:1> " It certainly wasn't the <}> <-> <w> tenants' </w> </-> <+>

tenants </+> </}> who wanted that changed," he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#21:1> He also said the law should ensure security deposits paid by

tenants to landlords are held in trust by the province and that condition

reports at the time of occupancy be mandatory. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#22:1> The new bill permits landlords to continue holding deposits in

their own trust accounts.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#23:1> The previous bill forced landlords to report the location of those

accounts to the province. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#24:1> The new bill makes condition reports mandatory only if requested

by a landlord or tenant. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#25:1> Lewis Rosenberg, head of the Professional Property <w> Managers'

</w> Association, said he has not had time to read through the new bill and

said he could not comment until next week. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#26:1> David Smith, president of the Winnipeg Real Estate Board, said he

was pleased the government allowed groups from both sides of the debate to

participate in the consultation process. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#27:1> " It looks like a good piece legislation," he said.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#28:1> " It also offers a good due process approach where is you don't like

a decision, you could have it appealed." </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#29:2> <h> <bold> Crown to appeal probation for sex assault </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#30:2> By Patrick McKinley </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#31:2> The Crown will appeal the sentence of a man put on two <w> years'

</w> probation for a sexual assault that transmitted gonorrhea to an

eight-year-old girl. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#32:2> Justice Minister Jim McCrae said yesterday he does not believe

the sentence imposed on Bruno Cristopher Hiller reflects the seriousness of

his offence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#33:2> " We're trying really hard to restore faith in our justice system

and sometimes it's hard when we get sentences that are inappropriate in our

estimation," he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#34:2> " This one is and we will appeal it and that's the only avenue

open to us." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#35:2> Hiller was originally sentenced to six years in prison in

February after a trial in which he refused legal counsel.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#36:2> But the Manitoba Court of Appeal ordered a new trial, ruling among

other things that Hiller made mistakes defending himself that infringed on

his right to a fair trial. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#37:2> Last week, in the second trial, where Hiller had a lawyer, Judge

Raymond Harris reduced the sentence to probation.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#38:2> Hiller had already served six months in custody. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#39:2> Manitoba Liberal Leader Sharon <}> <-> Caistairs </-> <+>

Carstairs </+> </}> charged yesterday that a pattern seems to be emerging in

which the courts treat violence against children less seriously than they

treat other forms of assault. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#40:2> " Like all parents, I am once again dismayed at a sentence which

clearly implies that sexual abuse of children is not considered a serious

offence," she said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#41:2> Carstairs noted she raised a case last year in which a man who

abused a cat was given a stiffer sentence than some offenders who abused

children. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#42:2> She said she has to question whether the courts understand how

serious child sexual abuse is when a stabbing in a Main Street hotel results

in a more serious sentence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#43:2> " The child will live with that all of their life." </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#44:3> <h> <bold> Oil companies warned to keep gas prices in line </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#45:3> By Patrick McKinley </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#46:3> The province is warning oil companies it will slap controls on

gasoline prices unless they keep prices in line. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#47:3> Toughening the government's stance, Consumer Affairs Minister Ed

Connery said yesterday he wrote to oil companies this week to remind them

that protecting consumers from price-gouging is the province's main concern

during the crisis in the Persian Gulf. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#48:3> Connery, who met with oil company executives about a month ago,

said he has called them into his office for a second series of meetings next

week. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#49:3> The meetings were called to outline the regulatory options the

government is considering, he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#50:3> One of those options is to have gasoline prices reviewed by the

province's Public Utilities Board, as the NDP Opposition has demanded. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#51:3> But Connery said he is concerned that would commit the province

to a long-term process of regulating prices in the industry and may not

guarantee a price reduction. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#52:3> He said the other option would be to set up a commission of

inquiry to report to cabinet order. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#53:3> The letter to oil companies comes after sabre-rattling by Premier

Gary Filmon last week. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#54:3> Filmon said that even after higher Canadian taxes were deducted,

Manitobans were paying more for gas than residents in Grand Forks and Fargo

were paying for gas trucked in through Manitoba. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#55:3> He said at the time he did not think that was justified. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#56:3> Winnipeg gas prices - 56.9 cents a litre before Iraq seized

Kuwait - soared to 66.1 cents before falling back to 64.9 cents,

coincidentally with Filmon comments. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#57:3> NDP consumer affairs critic Jim Maloway ( Elmwood) said he hopes

and believes the government's recent actions indicate it is getting set to

impose price regulation. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#58:3> " I think that it's only a matter of time now before they will be

forced into it," he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#59:3> Connery downplayed Maloway's suggestion that price controls are

imminent, saying the government has the option of letting the oil companies

continue to determine pricing. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#60:3> But he did say he wants to quiz company officials on recent

industry predictions that prices will head up again. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#61:3> " We want them to explain to us if it has to go up, why?
<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#62:3> What is the rationale?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#63:3> " The consumer has to be treated fairly in the marketplace and

that is our main concern," he said. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#64:4> <h> <bold> Schools warned after boy abducted </h> </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#65:4> Wolseley-area schools have been warned to be on the lookout after

a man abducted a 10-year-old boy Thursday while he was on his way home from

school, Winnipeg police said yesterday. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#66:4> Police spokesman Eric Turner said the youth, who was not

assaulted in the incident, was walking home near Clifton Street and Wolseley

Avenue when he was called over by a man who then pulled him into a waiting

car. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#67:4> Turner said the youth was in the car for almost two hours, being

driven around the city's west end. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#68:4> The boy was eventually able to break free from the man and ran to

a gas bar. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#69:4> The man is described as 28 to 32 years old, with an average

build, unshaven with a brown moustache and shoulder-length, straight brown

hair. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#70:4> He was wearing a long grey jacket, black pants, black and white

Chip and Pepper shirt and white Nike runners with pink lettering. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#71:4> The car is described as an older model dark green station wagon.

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#73:5> Vandals tipped over 31 tombstones at St. John's Cathedral in

Winnipeg's north end, but caused little damage. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#74:5> Police say the disturbed headstones were discovered by the

cemetery manager when he arrived for work early yesterday morning. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#75:5> A church spokesman said the gravestones were uprighted

immediately with no damage to the graves, some more than 80 years old </p> .

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#76:5> The disturbed tombstones are located in the southeast end of the

cemetery, near the intersection of Anderson Avenue and St. John's Avenue.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#77:5> The church spokesman, who did not want to be identified, said the

Anglican Church has considered putting up lighting to thwart vandals at

night. </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#79:6> <h> <bold> Jack to appeal conviction </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#80:6> <O> start of story and paragraph not on this page </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#81:6> His lawyer says he will appeal the verdict. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#82:6> Meanwhile, family and friends of Christine and Brian Jack - many

of them witnesses during the 10-week trial that began Sept. 10 - said they're

glad the trial is over and are satisfied that justice was done. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#83:6> " At least it's over.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#84:6> We can start to live our lives again, but we'll never forget our

daughter," Christine's mother, Valetei Reiter, said in an interview from her

home in New Jersey. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#85:6> " I know deep in my heart Christine will never return to us.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#86:6> I think the verdict yesterday just confirms it," Reiter said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#87:6> She said she now must face one of the hardest tasks to come out

of the conviction - telling the two Jack children. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#88:6> " I haven't told them about the verdict yet.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#89:6> I don't know how to," Reiter said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#90:6> She said the Jack children - seven-year-old Kirstin and

nine-year-old Adam - will also likely be told about the circumstances

surrounding yesterday's verdict, including the fact their mother is likely

dead. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#91:6> With the verdict in, a memorial service for Christine can now be

held by friends and family, she said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#92:6> Lidijia Jancovec, an old family friend whom Christine considered

an aunt, said from her Selkirk home that while the children haven't been

specifically told about all the circumstances surrounding the case, Adam has

remarked that he " doesn't want to see his father because he hurt his

mother." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#93:6> Cheryl MacMillan, Christine's long-time friend, said yesterday

she believes Christine is dead and " if he did do it, it would be better if

he admitted it." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#94:6> Jack's lawyer, Richard Wolson, said his client will be appealing

the verdict. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#95:6> " I just met with Brian, he's somewhat downtrodden, very

disappointed in the verdict, but has confidence that somewhere down the line,

he will be vindicated," he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#96:6> " He feels that he's not guilty.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-015#97:6> That's been his position from the very beginning and that's his

position today," Wolson said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#98:6> He said that as far as he is concerned, there is not proof beyond

a reasonable doubt that Christine is dead and that Brian killed her. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#99:6> Among the points Wolson will be appealing will be how Winnipeg

police handled the investigation. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#100:6> He has said that while all evidence pointing to Jack's guilt was

pursued, evidence that would vindicate him was ignored. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#101:6> Calling the investigation <quote> " one-sided and inadequate,"

</quote> Wolson at one point during the trial asked for a mistrial on grounds

police withheld information of witnesses who had reported seeing Christine

after she went missing. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#102:6> Hewak, however, did not grant the mistrial, although he added

he, too, was shocked police had not made full disclosure of the alleged

sightings to Wolson. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-015#103:6> Deputy police chief Paul Johnston said that while he is willing

to accept a certain amount of criticism over how police handle murder

investigations, he believes Wolson's remarks " went beyond the legitimate".
