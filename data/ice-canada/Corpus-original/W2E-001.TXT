<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#1:1> <h> Canada can't survive our poisonous cynicism </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#2:1> It is almost impossible to believe, but a year ago the Ottawa

Citizen made a mistake.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#3:1> It welcomed its readers to the last decade of the century. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#4:1> As Mother and other readers of this column know, the decade begins

only tomorrow, just 10 years before the 21st century starts.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#5:1> That conclusion rests on the reasonable assumption that no one

acknowledged living in " year nothing" and that somebody or other started

counting at <mention> " one" </mention> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#6:1> I wish this column to rectify any resulting confusion, but this

may be an impossible task. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#7:1> And yet, it is a time to be astonished by what has happened to us

in this decade.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#8:1> Shortly before it began - on May 20, 1980 - Quebec had voted almost 60

per cent against even a flirtation with sovereignty.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#9:1> An even higher percentage of Quebeckers convinced themselves that

separatism had disappeared in our time, to be replaced by the new fashion of

entrepreneurship.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#10:1> The rest of Canada was relieved and complacent. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#11:1> Before the end of the decade, not only have separatists been

enjoying their new lease on life, but they have finally spread the doctrine

of inevitability.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#12:1> This has been their greatest tactical triumph.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#13:1> It has created the bandwagon effect, now persuading even Quebec

anglophones to declare early for the winning side.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#14:1> Local separatists find their usual support among unthinking Canadians

far beyond the frontiers of Quebec. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#15:1> The search for the scapegoats who created this mess for Canada

has also started, and it will have no end.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#16:1> Since you insist, we will share two of our own prejudices with you,

underlining that they are not necessarily the most important factors, but

they are being little recognized </p> .

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#17:1> Jacques Parizeau was the first to realize the critical importance

to his separatist cause of our economic union with the United States.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#18:1> The Quebec business community, growing enormously in power, was the

fail-safe of Confederation at the beginning of the decade.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#19:1> Whatever the final judgment of the so-called free-trade agreement, it

quickly robbed federalism of its main support in Quebec.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#20:1> By the end of the decade, business had moved to a position that spans

neutrality and an unexpected desire to adventure. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#21:1> The other scapegoat is the press that gets blamed for everything.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#22:1> George Bain, probably Canada's most experienced and insightful media

watcher, has drawn attention to the knee-jerk assumption of most broadcast

and print journalists that, in any dispute from immigration to Indians to

ozone, government must always be wrong.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#23:1> Then the press complains about the public cynicism towards

politicians and politics that has been largely created by journalists who

prefer prejudices to homework.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#24:1> The law of averages must surely prevent even our present prime

minister from being wrong all the time. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#25:1> Maybe Meech Lake was not the answer to our constitutional woes,

but the galloping cynicism towards politicians created in Canada a mindset

that encouraged the rejection of just about any solution.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#26:1> If the words were not wrong, the process was wrong.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#27:1> The se1f-destructive consequence of our extreme cynicism towards our

political system is a readiness to throw out every baby that comes in a

government bath.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#28:1> For Quebeckers, public cynicism toward political leaders greatly

eased the path to separatism.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#29:1> For other Canadians, the same cynicism made almost any political

solution unacceptable - except the unthinkable solution. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#30:1> Even if the press has largely destroyed faith in our political

institutions and in the men and women who run them, it is never too late to

try being sensible.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#31:1> Democratic governments are rarely 100-per-cent wrong, 100-per-cent

stupid or 100-per-cent dishonest.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#32:1> As you always taught us, Mother, we should never question human

motives, but only the actions that flow from them. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#33:1> Whether people are fighting for federalism, for Quebec

independence or simply for a workable world, a little mutual trust and

friendly respect could be useful.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#34:1> Some objective analysis of what system looks most promising to human

beings would be refreshing on every continent. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#35:1> The first days of a new decade seem like a good time to start.

</p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#36:2> <h> Let us count our blessings for a merry Christmas day </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#37:2> The real art of being merry lies in making the right comparisons.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#38:2> The path to happiness of the season does not lead us back to the

imagined joys of Dickensian Christmases, or even the twisted memories of our

own lost youth.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#39:2> Whether we admit it or not, both were full of terminal hypertension

and stress you would not believe. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#40:2> No, to be merry, we must think of the things that we can be

demonstrably happy about.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#41:2> Since it may seem to be a dwindling list, we would like to offer our

help in making your Christmas really jolly, if not downright laughable, by

recalling some upbeat facts of life. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#42:2> First, let us all rejoice, that we are one year closer to the

next federal election than we were last Christmas.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#43:2> Doesn't that cheer 86 per cent of you? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#44:2> We in the Outaouais rejoice that we all have real mayors, good or

bad.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#45:2> If God had not been with us, She might have put us in Ottawa where

the mayor reportedly works for a developer and drops by City Hall to pick up

a second cheque. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#46:2> We can also be happy that economic union ( which the government

calls <mention> " free trade" </mention> ) has not yet been completely

effective.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#47:2> Well, it may already have paved the way for our separation from all

of Canada, and made a few hundred thousand people jobless, but, we are told,

the real results are yet to come.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#48:2> <quote> " Every Christmas better than the next!" </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#49:2> That's what we always say. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#50:2> We are not yet a world-class city ( like Scranton).
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#51:2> We in the Outaouais are optimistic that we will never depend on bush

league baseball to swell our pride, but we admit that we are behind in our

crime.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#52:2> Frankly, our murder rate is disgracefully low in the international

scheme of things.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#53:2> Washington is nudging 500 murders far this year, while the whole of

our national capital region can find only 10.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#54:2> That includes Gatineau's two terminations with extreme prejudice, but

not a single one in Cantley - yet.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#55:2> There are still eight days to go, and we are thinking about it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#56:2> Don't be depressed by our lagging mayhem.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#57:2> With the iron will of the Tory gun lobby, and the spaghetti-like

determination of our minister of justice, we'll soon be on a level playing

field with the Americans. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#58:2> Meanwhile, let us be happy that no one has been completely killed

during discussions at the councils of La Peche or Val des Monts.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#59:2> Most of the wounded councillors are healing nicely. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#60:2> The sewage seeping into the Gatineau from the unrepentant

householders of Chelsea has slowed to a trickle.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#61:2> Swimming in the river should be excellent between now and late April.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#62:2> We will not have a theme park at Mont Cascades.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#63:2> That should set hearts <w> a-dancing </w> .
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#64:2> Of course there's talk of having one in the lovely Meech Creek

Valley, perhaps combined with the largest garbage dump this side of the

Sparks Street Mall.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#65:2> But we have to put our garbage somewhere, don't we?
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#66:2> Especially when the Outaouais collects no blue boxes outside the City

of Gatineau. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#67:2> We don't have to worry about the country's future.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#68:2> We have that from no less an authority than federal Transport

Minister Benoit Bouchard.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#69:2> Questioned about the timing of his &dollar;300-million transfer of

assets into Montreal's space agency, he said he wanted <quote> " to manage

the country of today." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#70:2> Finally, all the church-going people of the Outaouais have a

special reason to be happy.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#71:2> They do not live in Ontario where a mayor, whose name is a household

word wherever it is known, was apparently discussing matters of <}> <-> s-x

</-> <+> sex </+> </}> : <quote> " I'm not interested in that kind of thing,"

</quote> he was quoted as saying. <X> <quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#X72:2> " I'm a church-going person." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#73:2> Here in the Outaouais, people are still interested.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#74:2> That, despite all, is what helps make it such a Merry Christmas. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#75:2> And that wish goes from us to all of you - even to those who live

in Ontario, Canada. </p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#76:3> <h> Selling out to public pressure </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#77:3> Just before the 17th tinny rendition of Rudolph the Red-Nosed

Reindeer engulfs us in the sweet love of Christmastide, may we be permitted

one more dyspeptic comment about the way the universe is unfolding? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#78:3> This particular universe is the <w> Outaouais' </w> own Museum of

Civilization.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#79:3> Well, now, we are not sure it is the <w> Outaouais' </w> own, for it

may secretly belong to the Mayor of All Hull.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#80:3> He is so proudly possessive of it that whenever a reference is made

to 'Ottawa's Museum of Civilization,' he threatens to steal Mayor Jim

Durrell's Green Creek sewage plant, perhaps Ontario's cultural equivalent.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#81:3> Whoever is in charge of the museum has a problem.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#82:3> It has something to do with freedom of expression.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#83:3> If we recall Article 2 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, that is

a good thing, guaranteed regardless of race or creed to any special interest,

voting bloc and potentially violent mob.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#84:3> Except that in Quebec, if you get a whole bunch of freedom of

expression, you may run a bit short on social peace, which is an even better

thing. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#85:3>

<p> Do you follow me? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#86:3> Well, come back to the Museum of Civilization.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#87:3> ( It's that older building just behind the curving Petro-Canada gas

station.)
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#88:3> This autumn it was to have a new travelling exhibition called Into

the Heart of Africa, sponsored at much public expense by the prestigious

Royal Ontario Museum.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#89:3> It was an examination of Canadian missionary and military experience

in turn-of-the-century Africa, prepared under the direction of a respected

University of Toronto anthropologist named Jeanne Cannizzo. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#90:3> Some ladies and gentlemen objected to Dr. Cannizzo's

interpretation of Africa of a century ago.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#91:3> Presumably their scholarly work on that era qualified them to make

telling criticisms of the display.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#92:3> That could enhance the interest of the exhibition as we unwashed

viewers weighed the merits of differing views.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#93:3> No, they did not say anything relevant within our hearing, but simply

dismissed it as <quote> " racist and stereotyped." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#94:3> We don't know what they mean, because by noisy street

demonstrations, threats against museums, disruption of university classes,

and pulling the levers of power, they blackmailed participating museums into

cancelling the exhibit.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#95:3> You see, the museums <quote> " didn't want trouble." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#96:3> Canada's Museum of Civilization was one of those that succumbed

to the mob.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#97:3> We are ashamed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#98:3> We don't know whether it was a good exhibition, because we were

not allowed to see it.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#99:3> If we judge the credentials of its sponsors, and the care the Museum

of Civilization must have exercised before contracting to receive it, the

exhibit, however controversial, must have been worthy of our attention.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#100:3> But somebody <quote> " didn't want trouble." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#101:3> The kind of trouble the mobsters were prepared to incite was

seen in Dr. Cannizzo's university classes where she was <quote> " harassed,

abused, and attacked" </quote> by a small claque that prevented her from

lecturing.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#102:3> The harassment was so violent that, on medical advice, she withdrew

from teaching on indefinite sick leave, and her course was dropped.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#103:3> The university president apologized, but took no action against the

mobsters who alone had freedom of expression. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#104:3> It was bad enough that the Museum of Civilization should have

bowed to such intimidation and denied us the opportunity to judge a scholarly

work.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#105:3> What is even worse is that this is, as far as we know, the first

time that a major federal institution in Quebec has given aid and comfort to "

social peace" as a preferable alternative to freedom of expression. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#106:3> We have heard no one in the Outaouais object publicly to the

museum's decision.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#107:3> In the years to come, we expect to hear the museum's policy quoted

to justify attacks against individual freedom, against individual rights, or

against a minority culture. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#108:3> Banning a cultural display because it might cause controversy

was a chilling precedent to create - especially in this place, at this time.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#109:3> Not even the drafters of Quebec's language laws went that far. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-001#110:3> No, it was the Government of Canada that sold our rights across

the river.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-001#111:3> But one day, it could be the anglophone minority that has to pay.

</p> </I>
