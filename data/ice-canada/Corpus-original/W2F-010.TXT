<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#1:1> RITA WEST
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#2:1> <h> In Sickness </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#3:1> " Mrs West, would it be fair to say that you and your hus <l> band

march to different drummers?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#4:1> I am sitting up in bed wearing the rose-sprig flannelette night

<l> gown I have borrowed from Nora.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#5:1> Mine is one of four beds in a green room on the surgical ward of the

old Halifax Infirmary.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#6:1> Dr Scranton leans against the wall, one arm behind his back.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#7:1> His head is turned away from me, but I can imagine smugness puffing

out his face as he addresses his five students </p> .

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#8:1> " Do you mean are my husband and I happy together?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#9:1> Sometimes," I answer.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#10:1> " But what does that have to do with this?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#11:1> I fell sick overnight.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#12:1> It's my body that's diseased, not my mind.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#13:1> Isn't it your business to cure bodies?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#14:1> I feel my skin like a wick drawing moisture out of my body.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#15:1> The IV pole jangles harshly against the metal bed frame.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#16:1> I have to lie down. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#17:1> " It is not for you to determine what our jobs are, Mrs West.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#18:1> Diagnosis is a matter for trained professionals, as you can well

appreciate.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#19:1> If you could heal yourself, you would not have chosen to come here at

a time when the government is closing a quarter of the beds in this hospital.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#20:1> Now perhaps you would be so good as to answer some questions for

these doctors." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#21:1> There are no questions today.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#22:1> The students have poked and prod <l> ded me almost daily for the

three weeks I have been in this bed.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#23:1> They feel sorry for me and I for them, we are all embarrassed in our

common dependency.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#24:1> And debased. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#25:1> " Let's say goodbye for now to our little medical enigma," Dr

Scranton invariably smirks as he leads them out. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#26:1> " <w> Rantin' </w> Scranton is what we all call him behind his

back," Heather the nursing assistant from Half Island Cove confides.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#27:1> " Rages and fumes just like an old bull.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#28:1> Still he's the only GI specialist in Halifax, so I guess we have to

be beholden to him." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#29:1> I have my own list of creditors and Dr Scranton does not rank

among them.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#30:1> It is a list I review often in the overhead glare of the blue light

which spills into the open doorway from the corridor at night.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#31:1> Like everything else in the hospital, it has an associated unpleasant

sound.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#32:1> The corridor lights, invisible and inaudible dur <l> ing the day, by

night emit a tightly squeezed, high-pitched scream.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#33:1> Heard only by the sick and the hounds of hell.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#34:1> But I know I have to guard against this type of inner comment.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#35:1> Or in seconds my pillow will harden into abrasive rockface under my

head and I will have to pack my mouth with starched sheet. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#36:1> Far better to stave off night terrors and those hounds with

ritual, a litany of thanks owed to the people who let me change my life.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#37:1> Like the list of people I nightly commended to God for safekeeping

when I was a child, before I could let myself drift off to sleep.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#38:1> Such an onerous enumeration.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#39:1> If I accidentally forgot someone I loved or fell asleep before I said

their name aloud, they would fall prey to unimaginable horrors the next day.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#40:1> Or still worse, that very night.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#41:1> All my fault.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#42:1> Only now I was the one left off a list.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#43:1> Still culpable though.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#44:1> And I could no longer remember what my old bargain <l> ing leverage

had ever been.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#45:1> In chronological order, then, I am indebted to: </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#46:1> &bullet; My Cape Breton neighbour, Rita, who, worn with watching

my despair over six winters, reminded me that there would never be an ideal

time to leave, and insisted that I phone the library school in Halifax, long

distance, right then and there from her trailer at the top of a hill in the

spilling rain as our two cabin-fevered three-year-olds raged around us; </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#47:1> &bullet; The library school prof who answered the phone that grey

mid-morning, not at all nonplussed by the wavering inquiry regarding

admission a month after applications had closed, who even held out the

possibility of a scholarship once I had divested myself briefly of a shining

academic history, albeit ten years past; </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#48:1> &bullet; The landlady who chose me over 16 other would-be tenants

in a city where three-quarters of the " for rent" ads dictated " adults only"

because <quote> " the little fellow looked so dear asleep in the back seat of

the car" </quote> when we came to look at the flat; </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#49:1> &bullet; My husband's mother who flew in to the rescue from

California the first week of October and stayed through till Christmas, when

I phoned her in desperation after a month with a child repeatedly home sick

from day care, and no agency willing to send a sitter because I had no

television set; </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#50:1> &bullet; Dear Nora in the upstairs flat, who, after I had ripped

off my nightshirt and thrown myself face down on the cool linoleum floor,

crazy with the itch and sting of red welts which had puffed up my whole body

after weeks of diarrhea, wrapped me in a wet sheet and rocked me in her arms

until I settled, then told me gently it was time to let it all go; phoned my

husband in Cape Breton to come and take my child, and drove me to the

Emergency at the Halifax Infirmary. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#51:1> In chronological order, then, against the hissing blue lights,

against the approaching crepe soles smacking the floor in an exaggerated

kiss, against the offstage screaming of strangers, against the assault of the

night nurse's knee as she nudges the IV pole into the chrome bed rail, again,

against the unabashed puncturing of needles, the shameless probing of

thermometers, against the sanctioned siphon <l> ing of blood and urine,

against the illicit seepage of bodily fluids. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#52:1> For dear life I hang on to this chronology, I insist on it.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#53:1> I have come to realize it is a convention universally observed among

patients.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#54:1> Within moments of settling into bed or coming out of anaesthetic we

have exchanged life histories: who we were before we came, what drama

delivered us to hospital, the prophecies of our guardian doctors, the

projected date of return into our inter <l> rupted but waiting lives.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#55:1> It is important to name days, fix dates.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#56:1> Thus do you establish your place in the pecking order, the living

over the dead. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#57:1> This was made clear to me early by Mary MacEachern.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#58:1> The wife of a Canadian Tire manager from Antigonish, she had been

referred to Halifax for an assessment.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#59:1> Fifteen years ago she had lost her leg to poor circulation, and now

her other leg was threatened.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#60:1> Even at worst, she told me, she would be on her way home in three to

four weeks.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#61:1> A handsome, bitter woman without children, she quickly determined

that my diagnosis was unclear, my treatment, to date, ineffectual, my date of

release not even guessed at.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#62:1> This made her pitiless.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#63:1> She laughed uproariously every time I leapt from bed and bolted

across the floor to the shared bathroom, dragging an unwill <l> ing

<IV pole behind me.  </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#64:1> " I'll just bet there were times you never made it to the

bathroom in time, <}> <-> ay </-> <+> eh </+> </}> , say in a mall somewhere

or on a bus across town?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#65:1> Which was exactly the question Dr Scranton had asked me at the

initial examination, in more professionally acceptable language, of course.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#66:1> Several times a day Mary MacEachern would ask me to get her pop or

chips or a paper from the vending machine at the end of the hall, I was

convinced, just so she could laugh uncontrollably as I set out accompanied by

the IV pole.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#67:1> I kept her amused, I would soon be on my way to a new job in Ottawa,

at least both my legs were in good working order, I repeated to myself

several times a day. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#68:1> But that was shortly after I arrived.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#69:1> Just after newlywed Estelle Macmillan was discharged following an

emergency appendectomy.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#70:1> A nurse appeared to accompany her downstairs.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#71:1> " But when can my husband and me, well, I'll be coming home, you

know, after five days and &dotted-line; "
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#72:1> She was addressing the floor and I could see her scalp flushed red

under the pale hair. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#73:1> " Oh, you mean, when can you and your husband resume normal

sexual relations?" the nurse articulated unmistakably as she led her down the

corridor.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#74:1> Just before Mrs Howe arrived.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#75:1> And Mrs Ladouceur and I waited. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#76:1> Is this when I begin to search outside the window?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#77:1> When the hos <l> pital days finally blur into a predictable monotony?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#78:1> Morning blood pressure, thermometer, <smallcaps> iv </smallcaps>

checks, tepid sponge baths, trays for those who can eat.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#79:1> Heather assigns me the task of documenting my body's failings — " you

can write as good as I can" — as she hands me a clipboard.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#80:1> And, of course, the waiting: for tests, for test results, for

visitors, for doctor's rounds; waiting for medication, waiting for the pain

to stop, waiting for the body's own sweet time. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#81:1> My bed is nearest the window and there, on the other side of the

glass, all legitimate life happens.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#82:1> I can see the parade as it rolls along the street.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#83:1> Women chat as they walk, young men slam car doors and rev up engines,

mothers drag toddlers and lug groceries, kids yell, dogs bark, cats lounge,

old men shuffle, kites tug at their ribbons.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#84:1> By chance or mischance I have fallen off the face of the earth.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#85:1> This is the most neutral way I have of describing it to myself.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#86:1> Leaving out culpability or madness or a vengeful god. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#87:1> I look down onto a flat asphalt roof.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#88:1> In the August sun it is adorned with several webbed aluminum chairs,

a faded canvas cot, a striped towel, a pink chenille bedspread, and a cable

spool on its side, with glasses, beer cans, and a pair of sunglasses on a

strap.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#89:1> There, I have described it as a theatre set I know intimately, right

down to the glass ashtray ( emptied yesterday) holding down one of the

corners of the bedspread, Between 3:30 and 4:00 p.m.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#90:1> I will people it with young women, two or three of them, and their

friends and boyfriends, all healthy and sound of limb.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#91:1> I am longing for them to appear, just as I am yearning for the

arrival of someone who loves me, someone who will rescue me.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#92:1> I am beginning to lose hope. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#93:1> Mrs Violet Ladouceur has been here before us all.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#94:1> Her separate long feet propped on three white cushions, as if for

presentation, were what I first saw when I was taken to my bed.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#95:1> They might have been the marble feet of saints and archbishops lying

in state in the cathedrals of my childhood, such was Mrs Ladouceur's posture.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#96:1> Instead her feet were swollen and bruised, blotched purple and blue,

such an arresting sight that the body attached to them was almost

inconsequential, a thin, pale, ghostly old woman. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#97:1> The nurses strapped her into a chair for feeding, forcing in

mouthful after mouthful without waiting for her to swallow.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#98:1> They scolded her for forgetting to call for the bedpan, but I had

seen her ringing, and waiting and waiting.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#99:1> She showed no interest in life around her and spent most of the day

eyes open to the ceiling.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#100:1> Most of the night, too, I discovered. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#101:1> " Mrs Ladouceur," I approached her on my second night in resi

<l> dence, " I'm sorry to be disturbing your sleep.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#102:1> This is the sixth time I've clattered to the washroom." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#103:1> " No trouble," she whispered in a voice hoarse with disuse. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#104:1> " Are you frightened or lonely?" I asked. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#105:1> " No," she said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#106:1> " I'll never go home again.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#107:1> I'm going to die here." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#108:1> " No, you're not.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#109:1> The doctors keep saying you'll be going home soon." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#110:1> " They're playing me for a fool.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#111:1> I'm an old lady and I'm going to die." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#112:1> " Do you have family here in Halifax, Mrs Ladouceur?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-010#113:1> " Oh, yes, I have one son, Douglas.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#114:1> Do you know, when he was a baby, he won a contest for the most

beautiful baby in Canada.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#115:1> It was during the War."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#116:1> My husband was in the Forces overseas.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#117:1> They had a photo of Douglas in a sailor suit that flashed on the

screen before the movie started in the theatre. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#X118:1> Such a pretty baby.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#X119:1> Red curls all over his head, blue eyes and chubby cheeks.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#X120:1> <quote> 'Canada's Most Beautiful Baby' </quote> - that's what it

said under his picture on the screen.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-010#X121:1> I was so proud of him. </p> </X> </I>
