<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#2:1> by Stephen Stamp

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#3:1> If there is a common thread among the astronomers at UVic, it is

the sense that they find the universe so awe-inspiring that they have no

choice but to try to learn its secrets and to try to communi <l> cate their

findings and their sense of awe to others.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#4:1> Their activities range from lab instructor Russ Robb demonstrating the

power of the sun for high school stu <l> dents by burning a pencil with a

tele <l> scope, to Dr. Chris Pritchet determining the distance of quasars

millions of light-years away. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#5:1> The diversity and quality of astrono <l> my research being

conducted at UVic is among the reasons that the Herzberg Institute of

Astrophysics ( HIA) of the National Research Council plans to relo <l> cate

four of its sections to the university from their present location in Ottawa.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#6:1> The Institute is still awaiting final approval for the move, but the

govern <l> ment of B.C. has committed &dollar;22 million for the construction

of a new building on campus to house it.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#7:1> The HIA was estab <l> lished in 1975 and is a significant world-class

centre for space sciences and astro <l> physics.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#8:1> The HIA cited the work of UVic's astronomers and their links with

other institutions such as the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory ( DAO),

which is a section of the HIA, as primary reasons why it wishes to move to

UVic.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#9:1> This move would bring about 100 more professional scientists and

support staff to the university and would create an improved environment for

UVic's already admirable graduate and under <l> graduate programs in physics

and astronomy. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#10:1> The roots of UVic's astronomy pro <l> gram can be traced to

Saskatchewan in the 1920s and <w> ' 30s </w> .
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#11:1> A young John Cli <l> menhaga would lie in a field on his <w> par <l>

ents' </w> farm and stare upwards, captivated by the beauty and wonder of the

sky.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#12:1> <quote> " I've had a long-standing interest in the stars since I was

a boy," </quote> Climenhaga says, and <quote> " Saskatchewan's clear, trans

<l> parent sky" </quote> was perfect for viewing them. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#13:1> Climenhaga believes that <quote> " it's human curiosity to want

to find out how the uni <l> verse functions. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#X14:1> You want to understand the physical universe.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#X15:1> If you're a sheep or a cow, you probably don't worry about it. </X> "

</quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#16:1> For much of his early life, Cli <l> menhaga didn't have much time to

worry about it, either.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#17:1> He helped his father run the family farm for several years before

enrolling at the University of Saskatchewan at the age of 25, where he earned

his B.Sc. in honours math and physics.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#18:1> He taught at Regina College while completing his master's degree and

then took a job at Victoria College in 1949, at age 33.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#19:1> At the time, he was one of only two physics instructors at the

college. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#20:1> In Victoria, his interest in the sky was rekindled when he worked

as a summer research assistant at the DAO.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#21:1> The lure was strong enough that in 1954 Climen <l> haga took a

two-year unpaid leave of absence to earn his Ph.D. in astronomy from the

University of Michigan.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#22:1> Two years after returning to victoria College, he became the first

head of the Depart <l> ment of Physics, a post he held for 11 years. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#23:1> During that time, Climenhaga con <l> vinced the university

administration to add an astronomy component to the physics department.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#24:1> The first astronomy courses were introduced in 1964, shortly after

Victoria College had become UVic. <O> photo </O> <O> VanderBerg </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#25:1> He continued to instruct students and conduct research full-time

until his retirement in 1982.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#26:1> He was Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science from 1969-72.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#27:1> Since his retirement, Climenhaga has continued his research and has

taught courses in the Department of Physics and Astronomy most years. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#28:1> As impressive as his academic record has been, Climenhaga has

earned an equally illustrious reputation as a researcher.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#29:1> His primary focus has been on the carbon 12 to carbon 13 ratio in

carbon stars, which are stars with an enhanced abundance of carbon.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#30:1> By studying the nuclear reactions in a star and measuring how much

carbon 13 is present, one can learn about how heat is produced in the star.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#31:1> Climenhaga has also worked with Dr. Jan Smolinski of the

Copernicus Astro <l> nomical Centre in Torun, Poland, study <l> ing

super-giant stars. <O> photo </O> <O> Gower </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#32:1> To demonstrate how enormous one of these stars is, Cli <l> menhaga

explains that if the centre of one were at the centre of our sun, the outer

edge would be around Mars.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#33:1> The pair of astronomers has concentrated on interesting features of

<w> super-giants' </w> spectra, which sometimes involve two or three gaseous

envelopes expanding out <l> wards at different rates. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#34:1> The extent to which Climenhaga is respected by his peers is shown

by the honours which he has received.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#35:1> Upon his retirement in 1982, the dome and astronomy laboratory on top

of the Elliott Building were named for him.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#36:1> In 1985, an asteroid was officially named Minor Planet No. 3034

Climenhaga, in honour of his research, his academic record, and his

importance in establish <l> ing the astronomy program at UVic. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#37:1> That program has grown to include several world-class

astronomers.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#38:1> Dr. Don VandenBerg is an Associate Profes <l> sor and is recognized

as one of the world's premier theorists in the evolu <l> tion of stars.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#39:1> In 1989, he received the E.W.R. Steacie Award, one of the most

prestigious awards for science and engi <l> neering in Canada.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#40:1> VandenBerg says that <quote> " a star can be modelled by solving a

number of fairly straightforward differ <l> ential equations, though a

thorough understanding of nuclear physics and thermodynamics is required."

</quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#41:1> VandenBerg has developed a sophis <l> ticated code that creates

computer-gen <l> erated models of stars.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#42:1> These models allow astronomers to determine with great precision,

among other things, the ages of stars, by simulating their evolu <l> tion.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#43:1> For example, with VandenBerg's models one can follow the sun from its

beginning, when it was just a ball of gases with no nuclear reactions occur

<l> ring, to its present state.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#44:1> He can then the <l> orize what will happen in the next five to 10

billion years. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#45:1> To those who may wonder why he wants to look billions of years

into the past or future, VandenBerg says that he is <quote> " just

overwhelmed by the idea that relatively simple equations can describe so much

about the universe. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#X46:1> I find it almost unbelievable that one can under <l> stand as well

as one does something as complicated as the sun. </X> " </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#47:1> It is the pure pursuit of knowledge that attracts him to astronomy.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#48:1> He also likens the &aeligature;sthetic pleasure of his work to that

of a musi <l> cian's. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#49:1> VandenBerg says that he is <quote> " on the fence between theory

and observation." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#50:1> Collaborating extensively with the DAO, he does very little observing

him <l> self.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#51:1> Rather, he engages in critical com <l> parison of observation and

theory.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#52:1> Thanks in large part to VandenBerg's research, theoretical models are

now becoming more and more sophisticated and more closely tied to

observations.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#53:1> This correspondence allows astronomers to view estimates of the ages

of stars with much more confidence.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#54:1> In fact, the ages VandenBerg has derived for stars are now used

worldwide as the standard ages, and his work has led astronomers to regard

his estimate of 14 billion years for the age of the universe as quite reli

<l> able. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#55:1> While VandenBerg has been trying to establish the age of the

universe, col <l> league Dr. Chris Pritchet has been busy determining its

size.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#56:1> The final answer has not been found yet, Pritchet says, <quote> " but

give us two or three years and I think we'll be able to tell you." </quote>

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#57:1> Pritchet studies galaxies, both very distant and closer, to

establish a distance scale of the universe; that is, how far apart objects

are from each other.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#58:1> He says that because the universe is expand <l> ing, the distances

are increasing.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#59:1> This leads to the conclusion that the universe was once compressed,

until the build-up of heat caused a giant explosion which has become known as

the Big Bang.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#60:1> The force of the explosion has been pushing the edges of the universe

outward ever since. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#61:1> Because of the great distances involved in his research, Pritchet

says that a characteristic of his work is that he uses very big telescopes.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#62:1> Rather than creating photographic plates in tele <l> scopes to

produce images of the objects he views, Pritchet primarily relies on a charge

coupled device ( commonly called a CCD) which turns images into data on

silicon chips.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#63:1> Those data can then be fed into Pritchet's computer to be reduced,

converting them to a format in which they can be used for calcula <l> tions.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#64:1> Pritchet says that <quote> " for every nigh observing, I probably

spend 10 nights or more reducing data." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#65:1> <quote> " Things are happening very quickly in astronomy now,"

</quote> Pritchet says, <quote> " because of advances in detector, tele <l>

scope, and computer technology. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#X66:1> We could hardly do anything if we didn't have complex computers to

reduce data. </X> " </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#67:1> An example of the advancing technology is a project in which Pritchet

is involved which would see Canada, the United States, and Britain work

together to build and operate two of the largest telescopes in the world (

approximately eight metres in diameter) over the next 10 years.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#68:1> Pritchet has also worked on the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope in

Hawaii and, along with VandenBerg and Dr. David Hartwick, has time booked on

the Hubble space telescope.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#69:1> This tele <l> scope was launched by NASA in 1989 and is expected to

produce extremely accurate images. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#70:1> NASA is working to overcome cur <l> rent problems which at

present make the Hubble useless for many astronomical purposes.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#71:1> This prospect is exciting, Pritchet says, because a space telescope

eliminates the distortion caused by the earth's atmosphere and thus provides

much sharper images. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#72:1> Pritchet calls astronomy <quote> " intrinsically a very exciting

science. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#X73:1> There is some of the same beauty and elegance in modern astronomical

science that can be found, though in a completely different form, in such

things as productions in the fine arts. </X> " </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#74:1> Hartwick, who has been at UVic since 1968, has made breakthroughs

in determining the mass of galaxies.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#75:1> It used to be believed that the mass of the Milky Way was 10 <sp> 11

</sp> times that of the sun, but thanks in large part to Hartwick we now know

that it is at least 10 times bigger than that.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#76:1> He was part of a group of sci <l> entists who proved that about 90

percent of the matter in the galaxy is <quote> " dark mat <l> ter," </quote>

which can't be observed by tele <l> scopes.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#77:1> This discovery has radically altered estimates of the mass of the uni

<l> verse as a whole. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#78:1> Dr. Colin Scarfe came to UVic in 1965 primarily because of its

association with the DAO and says that he has prob <l> ably put in more

observing time at the DAO than any other outside observer.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#79:1> The major emphasis in his work involves determining basic

astrophysical quantities of binary stars, including their stellar masses and

radial velocities.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#80:1> Scarfe measures the Doppler shift, which is the shift in a star's

spectrum due to its motion.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#81:1> For over 20 years he has also run a program from Climenhaga

Observatory to study period changes in binary stars which eclipse each other.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#82:1> He uses a photometre attached to the main telescope to time the

eclipses and record the times at which the light is faintest. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#83:1> Dr. Ann Gower has been a member of the Department of Physics and

Astronomy at UVic since 1973.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#84:1> She also sees a connection between astronomy and the arts.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#85:1> <X> <quote> " Beginning to achieve an understanding of the universe

makes one appreciate it more, just as getting to know about the theory of

music lets you appreciate Chopin's music even more." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#86:1> Gower is an expert in radio astrono <l> my.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#87:1> This involves studying very distant quasars and galaxies which give

out an unusually high intensity of radio waves.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#88:1> She often works with the Very Large Array ( VLA) in New Mexico,

making radio images of objects.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#89:1> Of particular interest is what brought about the exis <l> tence of

the radio galaxies. <O> photo </O> <O> This image of the Andromeda galaxy was

generated by the Climenhaga Observatory's charge coupled device ( CCD), which

replaces photographic plates in telescopes and provides images more quickly.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#90:1> The CCD can pick up asteroids up to 10 times fainter than the old

method could.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#91:1> It was purchased with university funds for the fourth-year astronomy

laboratory course.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#92:1> The department got the device this summer and immediately put it to

use to produce this image.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#93:1> The Andromeda galaxy is approximately 2.2 million light-years away

from earth, making it one of the closest galaxies to our own. Photo courtesy

of the Climenhaga Observatory. </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#94:1> Another interesting aspect is the common occur <l> rence in radio

galaxies of jets shooting out from either side of the core of a galaxy.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#95:1> At the core is an object which may be a black hole.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#96:1> A passing galaxy may disturb material near it and cause it to fall

into the hole, releasing tremen <l> dous amount of energy which may power the

jets.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#97:1> There are a large number of people in the field, trying to find out

how and why the process occurs. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-021#98:1> <quote> " The feeling of studying the distant universe is so

awe-inspiring," </quote> Gower says.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#99:1> She also finds that students are very interested in astronomy.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#100:1> <quote> " I love teaching, working with students," </quote> Gower

says.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#101:1> An indication of how devoted she is to the task can be seen on the

first day of each course she instructs.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#102:1> She brings her camera to class and photographs each student to help

her learn their names.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-021#103:1> But carrying out her own research is also very important to Gower,

both for its own sake and because it renews her excitement and enthusiasm to

return to the classroom and pass on to students how exciting the world of

astronomy is. </p> </I>
