<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-009#3:1> Louis Lumi&egrave;re, one of the inventors of the <indig>

cin&eacute;matographe </indig> , described the device that projected moving

pictures as <quote> " an invention without a future." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#4:1> Anticipating the debates that would plague this curious phenomenon

throughout its existence, Lumi&egrave;re saw the historical limits and

conditions that would define his invention.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#5:1> What is it for?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#6:1> What should it be for?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#7:1> Who uses it and why?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#8:1> While the numerous histories of the cinema that have been produced

since 1914 ( only 19 years after the <w> Lumi&egrave;res' </w> and Thomas

Edison's first demonstrations) have supplied ample lists of titles, names,

and dates, these kind of questions are often quelled by the spurious epithet:

entertainment. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-009#9:1> In the last 10 years, increased interest in film history has been

only partly due to the recognition of the poverty of existing film histories.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#10:1> It is also a response to the ahistoricism of the poststructuralist

critical theory that dominated cinema studies in the I970s.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#11:1> The turn to history on the part of many film scholars is in many

cases an attempt to integrate some of the in <l> sights provided by textual

theory into the lived history of film texts.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#12:1> History in this sense refers to the constitution of audiences in

terms of class, gender, and race, conditions of reception and funding, and

extracinematic culture.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#13:1> Only through consideration of the consumption of film texts can

<quote> " the cinema" </quote> as a social phenomenon be adequately

addressed.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#14:1> And yet historians with these ambitions do not carry out statistical

analyses of box office receipts and attendance figures ( although interesting

work has been done on the urban geography of nickelodeons).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#15:1> For the most part, the prac <l> tice of such historians remains

narrative analysis, but rather than identi <l> fying the redeeming features

of a given work, their aim is to identify the spectator addressed by the

texts of a given period and the institutionaliza <l> tion of that address in

film genres. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-009#16:1> Two histories of German cinema, corresponding to the two <quote>

" high points" </quote> of that national cinema - the films of the Weimar

Republic ( 1920s) and those of the 1970s - are especially acute studies of

the engagement of contemp <l> orary audiences with the films.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#17:1> Patrice Petro's <it> Joyless Streets: Women and Melodramatic

Representation in Weimar Germany </it> is a much needed antidote to the

prevailing historicization of German Expressionism as a prophecy of the Third

Reich and to histories that canonized great-but-anxious artist-heroes

eventually exiled to Hollywood.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#18:1> Thomas Elsaesser's lengthy study of an equally brief moment in German

history fills in the background and the spaces among the three directors,

Werner Herzog, R.W. Fassbinder, and Wim Wenders, who made <quote> " New

German Cinema" </quote> an international phenomenon.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#19:1> In both books, the abyss of the Nazi period and its difficult

aftermath, in which film production was little more than propaganda ( during)

and American colonization ( after), underlines the urgency of defining the

German spectator outside the overwhelming mystifications of fascism. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-009#20:1> Two books on American cinema, although perhaps not <quote> "

histories" </quote> in a conventional sense, isolate groups of Hollywood

films that delineate histories within the larger history of American studio

production.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#21:1> Rick Altman and Robert Lang manage, with different degrees of

success, to trace out histories of American desires in the contexts of the

Hollywood musical and melodrama respectively.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#22:1> If film in the <smallcaps> US </smallcaps> can be handily dismissed

as <quote> " entertain <l> ment," </quote> it is the responsibility of the

historian to find out what entertain <l> ment has meant at different times.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#23:1> For what desires does it portend to offer satisfaction? And whose

desires are they? The two studies in question take very different approaches

to genre, but in both cases the differences within genre films and the subtle

variations on a narrative formula demonstrate shifts in modes of address that

correspond to different historical spectators. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-009#24:1> While all four of these histories embrace feminist cultural

analysis, Petro's study of Weimar cinema, as its title suggests, takes the

most systematic <l> ally feminist approach.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#25:1> Her project is to recover an inscription of female spectatorship from

a body of films that has been until now discussed as a cinema produced by men

for men.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#26:1> No one, not even Petro, would argue with Siegfried Kracauer's

observation that the male Weimar protagonists tended to be weak, passive, and

anxiety-ridden.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#27:1> Indeed Petro expands on the androgyny and homoeroticism of many of

these films, but rather than situating the representational and narrative

instability within the context of modernism, as critics since Kracauer have

done, she suggests that these films might have provided an inscription of

<quote> " emancipation" </quote> for female viewers.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#28:1> This is not to argue for any actual relief from patriarchal

oppression for the women of Germany in the 1920s, but to point to a place

where their desires might have found representation. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-009#29:1> Although the trajectory of <it> Joyless Streets </it> is towards

the analysis of four key films of the 1920s ( one of them titled <it> Joyless

Street </it> ) , Petro sets up these analyses with an examination of the

gender politics of the period, which of course informed other discourses

besides the cinema.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#30:1> In the cultural theories of Kracauer, Walter Benjamin, and Martin

Heidegger ( three important predecessors of the postwar Frankfurt School),

German cities, especially Berlin, were consistently described as female.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#31:1> Moreover, as these theorists tackled the transformation of vision and

the gaze that the industrial metropolis was affecting, the female viewer came

to symbolize a distracted and fragmented mode of perception.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#32:1> Women were becoming a highly visible presence in Weimar Germany, not

only at the movies, but in the workplace and on the street.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#33:1> But they also remained at home, fulfilling more tradi <l> tional

roles.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#34:1> Petro argues against the prevailing conception of <quote> " mass

culture" </quote> - a term that acquired currency precisely in the Weimar con

<l> text - and for a culture that included not only women, but many different

kinds of women, whose place within a rapidly changing environment was

negotiated within a politics of spectatorship. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-009#35:1> In the illustrated press, a genre that boomed between the wars,

images of women tended to fall into two categories that appeared in both

left- and right-wing publications.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#36:1> The first and perhaps the most familiar icon is that of the New

Woman, the female consumer in highly masculinized attire.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#37:1> In magazines such as <foreign> <it> Die Dame </it> </foreign> , these

fashion layouts would have been ad <l> dressed to a female reader, matching

her new buying power with a loss of sexuality.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#38:1> The second representation was that of the proletarian mother,

typically pregnant and drawn or lithographed in round, dark lines.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#39:1> Ad <l> hering to melodramatic conventions, these images participated

in a discourse of pathos, which in the leftist press ( <foreign> <it>

Internationale Arbeiterhilfe </it> </foreign> and <foreign> <it> Arbetier

Illustrierte Zeitung </it> </foreign> ) was rhetorically opposed to the

bourgeois New Woman, situating anti-capitalist and reproductive values on the

site of the female body.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#40:1> <X> <quote> " The address to female voters emphasizes class

contradiction, whereas the address to male voters calls for class

reconciliation" </quote> </X> ( 139), sug <l> gesting that, when addressed to

female readers, the iconography of gender takes on meanings other than

<quote> " male anxiety and fear" </quote> ( 110). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-009#41:1> The address to women was therefore paradoxical; on one hand women

were the symbols of political and economic <quote> " liberation," </quote>

and on the other they represented the suffering of the underclasses.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#42:1> In the gothic fantasy films of the early 1920s, such as <foreign>

<it> Nosferatu </it> </foreign> and <it> The Cabinet of Dr Caligari </it> ,

feminine sexuality lurks behind the hysteria of <indig> <it> mise en

sc&egrave;ne </it> </indig> and violence; the deep anxiety of the male

characters is almost always released on the terror of virginal brides.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#43:1> Not surprisingly, it is in the figure of the prostitute that these

two discourses of modernity and pathos come together, and such figures abound

in the Weimar cinema.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#44:1> The main actresses of the period - Marlene Dietrich, Louise Brooks,

Asta Nielson, and Henny Porten - frequently played women who, in the latest

fashions ( often tending toward androgyny), used their bodies in desperate,

and almost always failed, attempts to survive in a cruel, cruel world.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#45:1> Petro argues that the visual excess of these silent films ( lighting,

staging, pacing, and violence that strain the bounds of realism) is born of

the impossible contradiction between the iconic New Woman and the poor

chances of her social mobility.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#46:1> In melodrama, the pathos of women's contradictory situation is

realized in concrete situations. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-009#47:1> If mass culture was characterized as female and if modernism was

the province of male anxiety, then the politics of representation were indeed

the politics of gender in Weimar Germany.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#48:1> The presence of women at the movies in Weimar and elsewhere in the

1920s was in many respects their entry into official culture.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#49:1> The production of <quote> " women's films," </quote> films with

female protagonists who suffer and usually die, and their public exhibition

provided the <quote> " conditions of visibility" </quote> for women: they

were addressed as spectators and desiring subjects.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#50:1> Petro might be accused of excluding class and sex-bound male

spectators from the pleasures that she identifies in Weimar cinema, and yet

the work stands as an exemplary model of historiography.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#51:1> She manages to acquire some distance from the evaluative discourses

of modernism and mass culture, but not by moving away from the canons of

German Expressionism and <foreign> <it> Kammerspiel </it> </foreign> ( street

realism).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#52:1> In order to point to textual expressions of frustrated desires for

social and sexual emancipation, she attends to the social representations

that underscore the formal innovations of some very well-known films. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-009#53:1> However much one might admire Petro's project in <it> Joyless

Streets </it> , it is hard not to have lingering doubts about the audiences

that she assumes for the films.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#54:1> Elsaesser's <it> New German Cinema </it> also has this problem.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#55:1> Where Petro cites a 1914 dissertation to support her claim that

<quote> " a vast number of filmgoers in Germany were women" </quote> in the

1920s ( xx), Elsaesser relies rather heavily on the writing of Michael

Rutschky ( particularly an essay called <quote> " Dreaming the Real" </quote> )

for his characterization of the Bohemian politicos who supposedly frequented

German cinemas in the 1970s.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#56:1> Neither source is either authoritative or terribly convincing, and

yet it seems to be necessary for both historians that they demonstrate the

empirical existence of those spec <l> tators who, they claim, are addressed

by the texts in question.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#57:1> One would almost prefer that they stuck to the textual evidence alone

if they were not prepared to offer empirical confirmation of their findings.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#58:1> It may not be possible to know with any certainty the make-up of

historical audiences in terms of gender, class, or political orientation, but

if film history is going to move away from narratives of great works and to

be able to account for the cinema in its larger sense, it is essential that

audiences be accounted for by some means. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-009#59:1> The New German Cinema, Elsaesser argues, can only be described as

a coherent entity in terms of its address to an historically specific

audience.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#60:1> In North America, postwar German film has been represented by only a

handful of directors and very few films made before 1975.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#61:1> And yet it was in 1962 that a group of German filmmakers signed the

Oberhausen Manifesto, simultaneously tolling the death of the <quote> " old

cinema" </quote> and in <l> stituting a system of federal subsidies for

German film that continues to the present day.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#62:1> The Young German Film, as Elsaesser calls the work that immediately

followed Oberhausen, had a <quote> " false start," </quote> though.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#63:1> Its pro <l> ponents fell into two distinct sets: those ( e.g., Kluge,

Straub) who challenged the Hollywood norm so radically that they antagonized

their potential audience, and those who fell too easily into the Hollywood

pattern and used the generous subsidies for poor imitations of the American

competition.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#64:1> The New German cinema did not come into its own until filmmakers were

able to find a middle ground between the avant-garde and the commer <l> cial

cinema and were able to address an emergent group of spectators in the wake

of the late 1960s student movements. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-009#65:1> If Weimar cinema was torn between mass culture and modernism, the

New German Cinema was characterized by a similar split.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#66:1> As a subsidized industry, film was ( officially) designated a

cultural product that might revamp a debilitated national cinema, but from

the outset this cinema was an <quote> " author's cinema" </quote> ( <foreign>

<it> Autoren </it> </foreign> ) , built around the efforts of individual

direc <l> tors.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-009#67:1> The duality of art and popular culture, further institutionalized in

the crucial role of television in this revamped industry, hinged on the

figure of the <quote> " visionary" </quote> artist hero who became him or

herself a commodity in the culture industry. </p> </I>
