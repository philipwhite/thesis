<ICE-CAN:S1B-019#228:1:C> And uhm so Mrs <@> De Klejn</@> <@> Divine</@> whatever she was

there as a parent volunteer <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-019#229:1:C> And I guess she thought that I was maybe <,> like <,> young or <,>

didn't have control of the kids or whatever so
<ICE-CAN:S1B-019#230:1:C> I'm about to read them <}> <-> the</-><=>the</=></}> story that

but</-><=>but</=></}> you know they'll be quiet or you can just go like this

and they turn around and they listen <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-019#232:1:C> And uhm I'm about to tell <@> Max</@> to not play with the ducks

that I brought in
<ICE-CAN:S1B-019#233:1:C> Like they know when they come in they don't play with the ducks
<ICE-CAN:S1B-019#234:1:C> I'm like <@> Max</@> you don't play with the ducks
<ICE-CAN:S1B-019#235:1:C> And <,> the parent volunteer goes hey hey shh shh <O> finger

<ICE-CAN:S1B-019#244:1:C> Maybe she thinks I don't have control of the kids but even when

Mrs <@> Dinglebear</@> came back she would just <,> completely <,> cut her
