<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#4:1> WARREN BENNIS, in his recent book,


<I> Why Leaders Can't Lead </I> , has suggested that: <l> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#X5:2> <quote> <it> In the 1960s, we wanted to make the world better.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#X6:2> In the 1970s, we wanted only to make ourselves better.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#X7:2> Now, at the start of the 1990s, we seem to be uncertain about whether

we can make anything better. </it> <sp> 1 </sp> <footnote> <it> 1. Warren

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#8:2> Clearly, such a negative view of pos <l> sibilities has not

prevailed on the edu <l> cational scene over the past decade.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#9:2> Indeed, education has been bombarded with a staggering variety of

proposed changes in recent years.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#10:2> Consider a few examples:
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#11:2> &bullet; One writer suggested that the way to correct the <quote> "

dismal failure" </quote> of Canada's education system is to refuse anyone a

driver's license until high school is completed.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#12:2> &bullet; Several provinces have moved toward increased amalgamation

of school districts as a means of improving effi <l> ciency.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#13:2> &bullet; Singer Joni Michell is reported to have suggested at an arts

education con <l> ference that the way to produce more artists is to

discourage them.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#14:2> &bullet; One of the restructuring initiatives undertaken in a U.S.

school included the local decision to operate with no princi <l> pal, but

instead have five management leaders and 17 committees.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#15:2> &bullet; Japanese educational authorities, long characterized in this

century as operating the <quote> " model" </quote> education system, are

seriously reviewing North American education because they are concerned about

the lack of creativity developed in Japanese schools.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#16:2> &bullet; In South Carolina, the state has tried providing <quote> "

bonuses" </quote> to schools exhibiting good standardized test scores.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#17:2> &bullet; And in the United Kingdom, long considered a bastion of

local school autonomy in curriculum, the central authority has moved toward a

national curriculum. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#18:2> Virtually every western nation and every Canadian province is

undergoing some form of educational reform.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#19:2> The real challenge for many becomes one of understanding these

proposals, many of which seem contradictory and some simply ludicrous. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#20:2> The way we make sense out of expe <l> rience is, of course, very

individual.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#21:2> The intent of this article is to share the writer's <quote> "

cognitive maps," </quote> in the hope that readers might better understand

current developments and inform themselves for more effective practice.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#22:2> Any such attempt would seem to require an indica <l> tion of the

reasons for action or change, the nature of proposed changes, and the methods

of implementing change. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#23:2> <h> <bold> The reasons for change </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#24:2> The voices of demand for improve <l> ment in our schools are

many, varied, and increasingly insistent, but they can probably be grouped

under two main headings. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#25:2> <it> Internal </it> - From within the educational establishment

itself - classrooms, schools, districts, professional associa <l> tions,

universities - come many of these pressures for change. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#26:2> Partly, this relates to our knowledge base, which has been

growing and deve <l> loping.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#27:2> The practical realities that teachers face from day to day ( for

example, the recognition of just how diffi <l> cult it is to motivate the

unwilling learner or to make learning meaningful to students who are subject

to so much stimuli) provide much cause for the search for better approaches.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#28:2> Add to this the theoretical contribu <l> tions to our knowledge

base.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#29:2> The increas <l> ed understanding from cognitive psycho <l> logy of

how we must place new learning into our own individual meaningful <quote> "

whole" </quote> or context, or the recognition of Piagetian developmental

stages, are examples of knowledge that place demands on us for change. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#30:2> But we also deal constantly with the awareness of unrealized

expectations in education.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#31:2> For how many decades have we known that elementary school science

should be a much richer experience for students, yet we've managed to change

so little?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#32:2> If critical thinking has been a goal of education for the past half

century, why does there seem to be so little evidence of its presence in

everyday life? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#33:2> <it> External </it> - To these voices from within education must

be added many external concerns. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#34:2> Economic realities play a very important part in these external

demands.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#35:2> Not only do we face stress from dimishing public resources for

education, but the economic environment has changed to the point where there

is little place left for the unskilled in our society.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#36:2> So we hear strident voices crying over a dropout rate that would have

been consi <l> dered unimaginably good a few decades ago.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#37:2> Can the schools actually develop in all students a level of skill and

knowledge which not long ago was required only of the relatively few?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#38:2> Or can we appro <l> priately increase our <w> graduates' </w>

problem-solving ability as necessary in a com <l> plicated post-industrial

society? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#39:2> And then, of course, we have the pressures of social changes.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#40:2> The list seems endless: sexually transmitted diseases, drugs,

violence, family and community breakdown, a more scienti <l> fically and

technically based workplace - all demand the school's attention. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#41:2> <h> <bold> The nature of proposed changes </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#42:2> The demands for change identified above do not lead to a single

conclusion.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#43:2> In fact, they not only become mixed, indistinct, and unclear, but

often exist in some tension.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#44:2> The need for the school to <O> Table Figure 1 </O> be a warm, caring

place where students can find comfort from the fractured home or community in

which they exist, for example, is not necessarily compatible with the need

for more effort, and a more harshly competitive economic climate.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#45:2> Similarly, the pressures for reduced drop-out rates may conflict with

demands that all students have a higher level of tech <l> nical and

scientific literacy.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#46:2> And the diffe <l> rent <quote> " mixtures" </quote> of these demands

can produce greatly variant conceptions of what the school should be. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#47:2> One useful approach is to consider these different pictures of

education metaphorically.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#48:2> At least seven metaphors depicting the changed school as it <quote> "

should be" </quote> seem common.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#49:2> They are shown in Figure 1. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#50:2> <h> <it> <bold> The Factory </bold> </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#51:2> One picture of the <quote> " new school" </quote> is presented as

follows: <l> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#X52:2> <quote> <it> If we expect children to participate fully and equally

in this democratic society, they must learn a <bold> common, shared

foundation </bold> of knowledge, as well as certain <bold> common beliefs

</bold> and standards of conduct </it> [ Emphasis added]. <sp> 2 </sp>

<footnote> <it> 2.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#X53:2> <bold> A Legacy for Leaners: The Report </bold> of the <bold> Royal

Commission on Education </bold> ( Victoria, BC 1988), p. 94. </it>

</footnote> </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#54:2> Clearly, this is a picture of the Factory - a place where the

emphasis is on pro <l> ductivity, uniformity and quality control.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#55:2> And although educators may recoil at the coldness of that picture,

they also would find it difficult to disagree with the need for common

learning and a guarantee of success. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#56:2> A modification of this metaphor is heard in the vision of a

<quote> " technological laboratory". </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#57:2> This is still an uncommon view, but increasingly the school of the

future is pictured as one dominated by computerized learning, with

well-programmed software leading all students, on an individualized basis, to

mastery of essential skills and knowledge. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#58:2> <h> <bold> <it> The Department Store </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#59:2> In a department store, or a large con <l> vention, we can pick

and choose accord <l> ing to our interests.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#60:2> Another quote from the same source suggests that: <l> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#X61:2> <quote> <it> ...the larger challenge for the provincial system rests

in attempting to establish what one scholar describes as <quote> " a system

of plurality of excellence" </quote> ... a variety of career paths in formal

schooling leading to different types of high level competence other than

academic ability. <sp> 3 </sp> <footnote> <it> 3.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#X62:2> <bold> A Legacy for Learners: The Report of the Royal Commission on

Education </bold> ( Victoria, BC: 1988), p. 104. </it> </footnote> </quote>

</X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#63:2> Clearly this metaphor places stress on variety and choice.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#64:2> Indeed, in many cir <l> cles there are suggestions that the choice

should be extended not only to students in school, but also to parents for a

choice of the school their children attend. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#65:2> <h> <bold> <it> The Family </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#66:2> There are few parents, when sending their first child off to the

first day at school, who do not at heart wish that the school will, after

all, be not that different from home - a kind of second family, where love,

compassion, and co-opera <l> tion prevail.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#67:2> And certainly that desire is echoed by many in society who see the

school as too harsh, too unsuited to <w> students' </w> individual needs and

aspira <l> tions. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#68:2> <h> <bold> <it> The Garden </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#69:2> If the family metaphor comes primari <l> ly from parents, a

closely allied picture comes mainly from educators - the view of the school

as a garden ( or perhaps more correctly, an <quote> " untended meadow"

</quote> ) , a place where beautiful things grow at their own rate and in

their own manner, if only educators provide the right conditions.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#70:2> The school, according to this conception, should be characterized by

growth, beauty, diversity, and interest.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#71:2> Consider, for example, the words of psychologist Carl Rogers: <l> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#X72:2> <quote> <it> ... I turn to an activity, a purpose, which really

warms me - the facilitation of learn <l> ing.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#X73:2> When I have been able to transform a group - and here I mean all the

members of a group, myself included - into a community of <bold> learners

</bold> , then the excitement has been almost beyond belief.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#X74:2> To free curiosity; to permit individuals to go charging off in new

directions dictated by their own questioning and exploration; to recognize

that everything is in process of change - here is an experience I can never

forget. <sp> 4 </sp> </it> <footnote> 4.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#X75:2> <it> Carl Rogers, <bold> Freedom to Learn </bold> ( Columbus, OH.

Charles E. Merrill Publishing, 1969). </it> </footnote> </quote> </X> </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#76:2> <h> <bold> <it> The Olympics </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#77:2> One only need imagine a sportscaster ludicrously commenting on a

100-metre dash, <quote> " That was a wonderful race, with no winners,"

</quote> to realize the nature of this image.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#78:2> For the Olympics are meant, through competition, to bring out the

best in competitors.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#79:2> And while the stress on winners in this metaphor may seem

inappropriate, with slight modification we can all see merit in a conception

of school which sets hurdles and demands excellence. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#80:2> <h> <bold> <it> The Freedom March </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#81:2> The vivid pictures we have seen in recent years of the masses

marching for freedom in Eastern Europe or China call forth this metaphor - a

picture of the school as a place for developing some passion over a

worthwhile cause.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#82:2> The voices raised for environmental educa <l> tion or Canadian

identity have this common theme: school should instil in students, indeed

indoctrinate them, with this intense desire to do something worth <l> while.

</p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#83:2> <h> <bold> <it> The Clinic </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#84:2> The medical model of a clinic, where the patient is referred for

successively more sophisticated investigations and diagnostic procedures, has

its reflection in an image of the school.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#85:2> In this view, present in the <quote> " cascade" </quote> model of

special education services, for example, the school should be characterized

by much more precision, as we seek to find the problem in someone's inability

to learn, and to fix it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#86:2> The purpose in describing these vary <l> ing concepts of the

school is not to denigrate any.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#87:2> Indeed, each has some validity in responding to some of the demands

for change.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#88:2> But we should note that these views are often in conflict.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#89:2> The result, once again, is part of the tension faced in schools, at

the board table, and in communities. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#90:2> <h> <bold> A framework </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#91:2> At this point, a digression is necessary to outline a framework

presented by John Ingalls. <sp> 5 </sp> <footnote> <it> 5. J. D. Ingalls,

<bold> Human Energy </bold> ( Don Mills, ON: Addison-Wesley, 1976), pp. 9-18.

</footnote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#92:2> Ingalls has suggested that people have two major categories of needs,

which in turn lead to two major types of behaviour.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#93:2> Type A Behaviours he identi <l> fies as those which represent the

basic human <it> need for certainty </it> , while Type B Behaviours are those

representing a capacity for tolerating <it> ambiguity or uncer <l> tainty

</it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#94:2> A brief description of each is con <l> tained in Figure 2. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#95:2> <w> Ingalls' </w> major point is that both types of behaviour are

normal, natural, and universal and, in fact, are required in our society.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#96:2> Type A Behaviours, which express our needs for certainty, are the

basis for all rationality.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#97:2> They are, in fact, behaviours of control which represent our efforts

to <quote> " make sense of things," </quote> and hence they diminish the

degree of free <l> dom and spontaneity which exists.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#98:2> Type B Behaviours, on the other hand, tend to be very accepting, and

hence reduce conflict; however, if they alone are present, they would make

any concerted effort virtually impossible. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#99:2> One can speculate that just as such behaviours are natural and

necessary for individuals, so are they for organizations.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#100:2> Both types of behaviour, for example, can be considered essential in

school systems.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#101:2> One type is ideally suited to obtaining maximum information which is

a requir <l> ed condition for effective problem-solving.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#102:2> The other enables some consis <l> tent and co-ordinated effort

toward common goals. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#103:2> This framework can be applied to the variant metaphors or

conceptions of the school.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#104:2> Certainly it seems reasonable to suggest that the concepts

underlying metaphors of the Factory, Olympics, and Freedom March appeal to

the need for certainty, control, and consistency. <O> Table Figure 2 </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#105:2> The Department Store, Garden, Family metaphors, however, present

concep <l> tions of education that provide for beha <l> viours leading to

ambiguity, variety, and creativity.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#106:2> The clinic can respond to the need for either kind of behaviour.

</p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#107:2> <h> <bold> The implementation of change </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#108:2> Although most would probably accept the internal and external

factors that demand change, reaching decisions on the desirable types of

change is much more of a problem.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#109:2> Even if such consen <l> sus is reached, we also face a variety of

available approaches to implementing a model of the <quote> " new school."

</quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#110:2> Here again, the educational techni <l> ques and the leadership

approaches at our disposal can be categorized under the two types of needed

behaviours. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#111:2> Some significant techniques fall under both headings.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#112:2> In the interest of promot <l> ing greater consistency, certainty,

and control, for example, we use core cur <l> riculum, objectives and

directions, mastery learning, textbooks, and high student expectations.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#113:2> Leadership ap <l> proaches that create a common vision, or depend

upon centralized decision-making, tend to promote consistency types of

behaviours as well. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#114:2> In the interests of promoting variety, ambiguity and creativity,

on the other hand, we use curricular electives, increased professional

autonomy, indi <l> vidualization, a variety of learning materials, and

student interest.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#115:2> Leader <l> ship approaches that increase personal freedom or rely on

human relations skills have similar purposes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-014#116:2> Once again, we observe a certain degree of conflict and tension

between the behaviours or approaches we use to pro <l> mote consistency and

control and those required to encourage variety and creati <l> vity. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-014#117:2> <h> <bold> Conclusions </bold> </h> </I>
