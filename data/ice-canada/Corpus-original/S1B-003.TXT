<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#36:1:A> <[> Mh hmm </[> </{>

<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#40:1:B> I just got the gallies uh <,> yesterday <,,> and they said

</[2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#61:1:A> <[2> Okay

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#62:1:A> <}> <-> Is it is that </-> <=> is that </=> </}> uhm a

well-established decision rules </[2> </{2> or can we mess around in the

decision rules

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#63:1:B> Well what <,> decision <{> <[> rule have you got in mind </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#64:1:A> Cos <[> <}> <-> I cos I </-> <=> actually </[> </{> I did </=>

</}> some research on sort of ah technical rules <{1> <[1> uhm </[1> and I

used the moving average crossovers and trading rules like that <,> uhm <O>

cough </O> versus naive uhm positions in uh a ten year
<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#65:1:A> <{2> <[2> bond </[2> and I actually came up with ah a

<-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> moving average technical trading rules uhm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#66:1:B> <[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#67:1:B> <[2> Uh huh </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#68:1:B> Now does that fit into the duration estimation <,> or <{> <[>

no </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#69:1:A> <[> Uhm </[> </{> no <}> <-> it's <{> <[> only </-> <=> it's

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#71:1:A> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#72:1:B> Ya so let's just focus on what we can do with the duration <{>

<[> uhm </[> <,,> as opposed to a technical role cos we <}> <-> wanna </->

<+> want to </+> </}> keep it narrow enough

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#73:1:A> <[> Okay </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#75:1:A> Right
<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#76:1:A> Okay okay <,,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#77:1:B> Okay

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#95:1:B> <[> Is this your </[> </{> vacation time

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#96:1:A> Uh no it seems to me it's going to be <,> sort of work time

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#106:1:A> People listen to them

that's the basis of the hedge ratio

risk
<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#151:1:A> Uhm the next week <,> say instead of the duration being four years

it's three point eight do I readjust my <,,> treasury's hedge or do I just

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#156:1:B> <[2> Cos if you roll over every day </[2> </{2> it's

<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#160:1:B> Here's the ratio and we'll just run through it <{> <[> <,,> </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#161:1:A> <[> Right </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#163:1:A> <[> Right <,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#165:1:B> And it's just a question of

of these studies is a week <,> right

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#167:1:A> Okay

<=> so that </=> </}> would work <,> just fine because uh we get new duration

estimates each week <,,> uhm from the Salomon
<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#169:1:A> Uhm some of the other stuff is monthly <,,> unfortunately
<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#170:1:A> <}> <-> I </-> <=> I'm </=> </}> going to see if I can get some uh

<.> b </.> weekly <,> duration estimates from uhm uh Morgan Stanley when I go

down there maybe even Salomon <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#171:1:A> Uh but I'm <,> betting on weekly being about the best I can get
<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#172:1:A> Uhm <O> cough </O> and I've got most of the data already in <?>

RATS </?> <,> uh ready to run stuff
<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#173:1:A> So that's <,,> <{> <[> a nice thing </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#174:1:A> <[> Mh hmm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#175:1:A> I don't have to <}> <-> wait </-> <=> waste </=> </}> months

working on data so
<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#176:1:A> Uhm <,> but <}> <-> as </-> <=> as </=> </}> far as ahm <,,> sort

of latitude <}> <-> of </-> <=> of </=> </}> empirical duration should I just

stick with De Rosa and maybe one other empirical duration measure and then

compare it with <,> my three or four <,> Wall Street duration estimates <{>

<[> and then <unclear> a few words </unclear> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#177:1:B> <[> So <}> <-> you're going to get Wall </-> <=> you've </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#178:1:A> <{> <[> Right </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#179:1:B> <[> You see </[> </{> that's the thing is that Breeden's also

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#180:1:A> Uh <{> <[> okay </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#181:1:B> <[> The question </[> </{> is <,,> uhm <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#182:1:B> Now the easiest thing to do <{1> <[1> <,,> </[1> and <,,> a

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#184:1:A> <[1> Mh hmm </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#185:1:A> <[2> Right
<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#186:1:A> Oh definitely </[2> </{2> definitely
<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#187:1:A> And that's why I'm saying a <{> <[> <,,> uhm </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#188:1:B> <[> Ya cos the Wall Street </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#189:1:B> Ya if you get the Wall Street estimates right he's done it <,>

already
<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#190:1:B> And he shows that while they have <}> <-> some </-> <=> <{1> <[1>

<,> some </[1> </=> </}> value these <w> brokers' </w> forecasts but at the

same time <,> right what goes into these things <,> is <,,> right survival

curves uhm <,,> the P S A <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#191:1:B> <{2> <[2> aging curves </[2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#192:1:A> <[1> Mh hmm </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#193:1:A> <[2> Mh hmm </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#194:1:B> Right
<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#195:1:B> So it's a lot of <,> uh assumptions about lifetime prepayment

rates <{> <[> <,> that </[> are

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#196:1:A> <[> Right </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#197:1:B> You know everybody's got <}> <-> their </-> <=> their </=>

<,,> here to develop <,> just this one part <{> <[> <,,> </[> of <,> uh <,>

the broker's approach <,> to getting the final number <}> <-> of </-> <=> <,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#199:1:B> So <,,> uhm and we don't want to do that <,> <{> <[> because

right </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#200:1:A> <[> Well <}> <-> I've already </-> <=> I've </[> </{> already

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#202:1:B> <[> Ya you </[> </{> could use that <}> <-> as a <}> <-> <.>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-003#203:1:A> <[> Right </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#204:1:A> Okay
<ICE-CAN:S1B-003#205:1:A> Uhm so <}> <-> do you </-> <=> do you </=> </}> think it's a good
