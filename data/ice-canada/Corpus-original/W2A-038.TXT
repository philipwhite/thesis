<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-038#4:1> Quantitative reliability evaluation is an important element in

power system planning and operation and the indices generated can be used to

make a wide variety of planning decisions.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#5:1> Quantitative reliability evaluation methodologies are now firmly

established in the area of generating capacity adequacy assessment and are

routinely used in planning new capacity additions.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#6:1> Generating system adequacy is primarily governed by the

unavailabilities of the units in the system and therefore one alternative to

adding additional capacity is to consider improving the availabilities of

existing units in the system. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-038#7:1> Generating unit availability can be improved by unit and plant

refurbishment, i.e. by investing capital to reduce the unit forced outage

rate ( FOR).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#8:1> Many electric power utilities are doing this rather than investing in

new generation equipment.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#9:1> Generating unit unavailability has a major impact in a number of

overall system areas, most of which are not normally considered by power

station designers, plant operators and managers responsible for actual power

plant modifications.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#10:1> This paper presents a comprehensive and basic approach to recognizing

the impacts of generating unit unavailability on expected energy production

costs, expected failure costs and capacity costs.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#11:1> The procedure is energy-based and utilizes an interrupted energy

assessment rate applicable to the consumers served by the system to

incorporate the expected load curtailment costs.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#12:1> The worth of generating unit refurbishment is assessed in terms of

overall system costs.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#13:1> The cost of any specific unit refurbishment can be compared with the

resulting net benefits and used to make decisions. </p> <X>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-038#24:1> An electrical power system serves the basic function of supplying

all types of customers with electrical energy as economically as possible and

with an acceptable degree of continuity and quality
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#25:1> Reliability has, in recent years, become an important utility design

criterion.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#26:1> It is a highly complex quantity which is dependent on a wide range of

factors.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#27:1> Power system reliability <fnr> <sp> 1 </sp> </fnr> can be broadly

classified into two basic and functional categories, namely system adequacy

and system security <fnr> <sp> 2 </sp> </fnr> <footnote> 1. Billinton, R.,

<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#28:1> System adequacy is governed by the existence of sufficient facilities

within the system to satisfy the load requirements.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#29:1> Such facilities include generation, transmission and distribution.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#30:1> Adequacy assessment is, therefore, concerned with static system

conditions and does not include disturbances in the system.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#31:1> System security is concerned with the perturbations arising within

the system, such as local and/or widespread disturbances, loss of any major

facility, etc.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#32:1> This paper is restricted to adequacy assessment. </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#34:1> The basic system adequacy indices are the loss of load expectation (

<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#35:1> The calculated values are very dependent on the individual generating

unit forced outage rate ( FOR) values.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#36:1> The system peak load carrying capability ( PLCC), which is the peak

load that a system can carry at a specified system risk index, is also very

dependent on the generating unit FOR values.

used to examine the system impact of generating unit forced unavail <l>

ability on energy production costs, customer interruption costs and capacity

costs.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#39:1> In order to incorporate these considerations in a quantitative

evaluation of the system benefits associated with reducing the forced

unavailability of a particular generating unit, it is necessary to utilize an

energy-based approach.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#40:1> This cannot be accomplished using the standard loss of load

expectation technique favoured by many utilities.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#41:1> It is also necessary to utilize an overall approach which can, in

addition to evaluating the overall system expected energy not supplied,

provide the expected energy produced by each generating unit in the system.

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-038#44:1> Many power utilities have recognized the implications of low unit

availabilities and are actively engaged in unit refurbishment to improve

these conditions.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#45:1> The economic cost associated with a given unit FOR can be defined as

the variation in the total system costs resulting from changing the unit FOR

by an increment, while maintaining the same level of system reliability.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#46:1> The total system costs include the three components of capacity cost,

failure cost and production cost.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#47:1> In this calculation, it is necessary to analyze the impact on the

adequacy performance of the system of varying the FOR and to recognizing the

variation in adequacy in terms of extra capacity. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-038#48:1> Additional capacity which is required to compensate for the

decreased level of system adequacy resulting from increased unit FOR can be

obtained by adding peaking units in the form of gas turbines.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#49:1> The simple addition of gas turbines may not, however, be the most

effective method of adding capacity to a system over the long term.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#50:1> It may be more appropriate in a particular system study to consider

the actual long range plans of the utility which include specific unit sizes,

types and locations.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#51:1> The objective is to determine the average cost associated with the

addition of an increment of generating capacity.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#52:1> In order to do this, a present-worth analysis was conducted for an

expansion period of thirty years.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#53:1> The average cost associated with a unit increase in peak load

carrying capability ( PLCC) was determined from these analyses.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#54:1> Several sensitivity studies were conducted to study the impact on

this capacity cost figure of load forecast uncertainty, unit size and type

and annual load growth etc.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#55:1> The worth of unit refurbishment is assessed using the capacity cost

benefits due to increased system PLCC and the benefits/losses in the system

production costs and failure costs.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#56:1> The cost of refurbishment can be compared to its worth in order to

make objective decisions.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#57:1> The ability to accurately estimate the refurbishment worth associated

with a given unit FOR is an important factor in deciding when to retire an

old unit and to replace it with a new one.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#58:1> The segmentation method <fnr> <sp> 5 </sp> </fnr> has been used in

these studies to estimate the refurbishment worth associated with a unit FOR

in terms of the capacity costs, energy production costs and the system

failure costs. <footnote> <O> reference [ 5] </O> </footnote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-038#60:1> An adequacy index can be defined as a parameter that denotes a

particular aspect of system reliability.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#61:1> The main objective in generating capacity adequacy assessment is to

estimate the necessary generating capacity to satisfy the system demand and

to have sufficient capacity to perform corrective and preventive maintenance

on the generation facilities.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#62:1> The LOEE, which is a measure of the expected unsupplied energy due to

the occasions when load demand exceeds the available generating capacity, is

an intuitively appealing index as it relates directly to the system function

of providing customers with electrical energy.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#63:1> The LOEE is also known as the expected energy not supplied ( EENS).

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-038#64:1> Expected energy not supplied has been considered as the primary

adequacy index in the studies described in this paper.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#65:1> The determination of individual generating unit energy production is

complicated by unit forced outages, maintenance requirements, the variability

of hydro inflows, etc.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#66:1> The earliest probabilistic production cost simulation which evaluated

the expected energy generated by each unit and the EENS of the system was

reported by Booth <fnr> <sp> 6 </sp> </fnr> in early 1972 and further

developed by Wood et al <fnr> <sp> 7 </sp> </fnr> in the same year <footnote>

analysis", IEEE Transactions On Power Apparatus And Systems, PAS-91, pp

M.A., " A new generation production cost program to recognize forced

outages", IEEE Transactions On Power Apparatus And Systems, PAS-91, pp

2114-24, 1972. </footnote> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#67:1> The evaluation of expected production costs, given that the expected

energy output of each unit in the system has been predetermined, is a

relatively straightforward task.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#68:1> Under normal circumstances, a preferred synchronizing sequence or

generating unit loading order is used to meet a specific load level.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#69:1> The loading order of the units does not affect the system EENS

provided that there are no energy-limited units in the system.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#70:1> The loading order, however, can have a considerable impact on the

system production costs.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#71:1> In order to minimize the production costs, the units should be loaded

in the order of their incremental variable costs, i.e. the generating unit

with the lowest incremental variable cost should be loaded first as a base

unit and the one with the highest variable cost loaded last or used as a

peaking unit. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-038#72:1> A major aspect in the justification and optimization of a

specific system expansion is the cost-benefit assessment of the resulting

power system adequacy
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#73:1> Conceptually, the benefits of having increased levels of electric

service reliability can be related to the costs of providing that service.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#74:1> Actual or perceived costs of interruption can be used to determine

the benefits of increased system reliability.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#75:1> The most practical method to establish reliability worth is to survey

electrical consumers, sector by sector, to determine the losses incurred by

each customer class due to power interruptions.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#76:1> The data produced by this method can in turn be used to generate a

composite customer damage function for a particular service area.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#77:1> The customer damage function is an attempt to define the total

customer interruption costs for that service area as a function of the

interruption duration.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#78:1> In order to create a practical tool for assessing reliability worth,

these customer interruption costs must be related to the calculated adequacy

indices such as the LOLE and EENS used in system planning and operation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#79:1> The EENS has been used in conjunction with the customer cost function

to obtain a factor relating customer losses to the worth of electric service

reliability.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#80:1> This factor has been designated as the interrupted energy assessment

rate ( IEAR) <fnr> <sp> 8 </sp> </fnr> <footnote> 8. Billinton, R.,

<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#81:1> As the name suggests, the IEAR relates to the loss of energy, or in

other words, to the energy-oriented index EENS.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#82:1> The EENS is a relatively simple factor that is closely related to

customer losses and is, therefore, a good indicator of system adequacy.

<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#84:1> The expected failure cost or customer cost is obtained from a

combination of the system EENS and the system IEAR values.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#85:1> The customer costs are an important component in assessing the

implications associated with an inadequate supply or unreliable system
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#86:1> The individual generating unit energy outputs and the total system

EENS are very dependent on the individual unit availabilities.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#87:1> The customer monetary losses due to overall system inadequacy are

therefore also very dependent on the individual unit availabilities.

<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#90:1> This method consists of obtaining the frequency distribution of the

equivalent loads by convolving the generating units in an economic merit

loading order.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#91:1> Convolution is achieved by suitable addition of the statistical

moments of the hourly loads and the unit outages.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#92:1> As each unit is committed, it is simulated by a convolution process

which gives rise to an equivalent load curve that takes into account the

effect of random failures of the committed units.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#93:1> The equivalent load can be viewed as an augmented load caused by the

forced outages of generating units.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#94:1> The method is based on segmenting the unit capacities by a common

factor and using these segments or blocks, in terms of the zeroth and first

order moments, to obtain the expected energy generated by each unit in the

system.

<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#96:1> The various indices for the RTS are as follows:

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-038#103:1> Given that the system contains a specific set of units with

assigned forced outage rates and that there are no energy-limited units in

the system, the system EENS and therefore the expected failure costs for a

given load model are fixed.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#104:1> In general, an increase in the FOR of a generating unit causes an

increase in the system EENS, which in turn causes a corresponding increase in

the expected failure costs.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#105:1> The impacts of varying the unit FOR were studied using the IEEE-RTS.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#106:1> The effect on the system EENS of changing the FOR of the 197 MW

thermal units is shown in Figure 1.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#107:1> The variation in the expected failure costs ( using an IEAR of 5.02

&dollar;/KWh) is shown in Figure 2.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#108:1> Figures 1 and 2 show that the system risk and failure costs

respectively increase with an increase in the generating unit FOR
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#109:1> ( Figures 1 and 2 are directly related.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#110:1> The difference in shape is due to the ordinate scales used in each

case). </I> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#X111:1> In a similar way, the impacts on the system risk of changing the

FOR of all the 20 MW peaking units, the 400 MW nuclear units and the base

loaded 50 MW hydro units are shown in Figure 3.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#X112:1> The 400 MW nuclear units have the highest FOR in the system and for

this reason alone make a major contribution to the high system EENS and

failure costs.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#X113:1> The 50 MW hydro units have the lowest FOR and therefore a large

variation in their FOR does not affect the system risk index to a large

extent.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#X114:1> The 20 MW thermal units are used for peaking purposes and hence do

not contribute significantly towards the system inadequacy.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-038#X115:1> A large variation in their FOR, therefore, does not affect the

system EENS as is evident from Figure 3. </p> </X>
