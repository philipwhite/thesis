<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#3:1> <h> <bold> YOUR DOG'S WELL-BEING DEPENDS ON YOUR ONGOING INVOLVEMENT.

</bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#4:1> We've all heard the old ad <l> age in its many different forms:

<quote> " As long as you have your health, you have every <l> thing."

</quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#5:1> While it may be a little overstated, it does stress the importance of

good health, and it's just as important for our canine friends as it is for

us.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#6:1> Continued good health doesn't happen by accident.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#7:1> Main <l> taining your pet's health takes a little time, money and

effort, but it certainly beats the alternative. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#8:1> It's never too early or too late to start paying attention to your

pet's health.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#9:1> If you don't have a dog yet, but are planning on adding one to your

family, now is a perfect time to begin learning what you can do to help

ensure your frisky friend stays in the pink.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#10:1> Even if you've owned dogs all your life, or your current com <l>

panion is a 'senior citizen,' it's still impor <l> tant to have an eye on

health. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#11:1> <h> <bold> Getting off on the right paw </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#12:1> Attention to good health begins as you decide what breed of dog

best fits your needs.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#13:1> The idea is to select from those breeds that most closely fit your

needs and your lifestyle. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#14:1> As you investigate your choices, find out if the breeds you are

interested in are pre-disposed to any health problems such as hip dys <l>

plasia or congen <l> ital heart disease.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#15:1> While this may not rule out the breed, you will want to pay special

attention to these concerns. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#16:1> <h> <bold> Selecting the right vet </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#17:1> While you are narrowing down the possi <l> bilities, there's

another important decision to make.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#18:1> Who will be your dog's veteri <l> narian?
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#19:1> He or she will be the second most important person in your dog's

life.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#20:1> Over the course of the average life span of a dog, the two of you

will pay numerous vis <l> its to his or her office, especially in the first

year.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#21:1> It's best to have selected a good vet <it> before </it> you bring

your pup home - if there's an emergency situation early on, you won't waste

precious time scrambling for medical help at the last minute. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#22:1> Unfortunately, many new pet owners select their veterinarian

based on only one factor - location.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#23:1> While location should be added into the equation, it should not be

the sole basis from which you establish such an important relationship.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#24:1> It would be like marrying the guy or girl next door simply because it

was convenient. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#25:1> There are at least four factors to weigh in determining the

veterinarian for you: services offered, cost, personality and loca <l> tion.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#26:1> Today, there is a wide range of ser <l> vices that may be offered by

your veteri <l> narian, from the full-service, total-care complex that

includes not only veterinary care but also grooming, boarding and pet

supplies to the specialty practices that, in some cases, see only pets with

special prob <l> lems.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#27:1> What services are most important to you?
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#28:1> Often, the more services offered, the larger the facility will be and

the less per <l> sonal the care. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#29:1> The cost of the care offered is also a con <l> sideration.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#30:1> Some pet owners are on a tight budget and are looking for the type of

care that fits in those budgets.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#31:1> Other families have more flexibility and want the very best care, no

matter how much it costs.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#32:1> Espe <l> cially if you live in a metropolitan area or don't mind

driving a little further, you can find an animal hospital to fit your needs.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#33:1> Personality is another important factor to consider.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#34:1> Remember, it is likely you will see your veterinarian fairly often.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#35:1> Why not have it be a pleasant occasion?
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#36:1> Most peo <l> ple are interested in a facility with a warm, friendly

and professional atmosphere.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#37:1> Are the facilities clean and well organized?
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#38:1> Do you get a sense that the people are inter <l> ested in what they

are doing and care about their patients and clients?
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#39:1> Do they appear to be enjoying their work? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#40:1> While location may not be the most im <l> portant factor, it

shouldn't be ignored.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#41:1> Re <l> member, your pet may need care in the middle of the night, or

on short notice, for some sudden ill <l> ness or an emer <l> gency.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#42:1> It might not be in your pet's interest if your veterinar <l> ian is

an hour's drive away. </p> <O> picture </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#43:1> With these four factors in mind, write out a list, starting with

the most important consi <l> derations.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#44:1> Now you are ready to find the veterinary hospi <l> tal to fit your

needs.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#45:1> There are three meth <l> ods that work well in combination: refer <l>

rals, yellow pages and visitation.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#46:1> Start by asking your friends and neighbours who have pets where they

go, whether they are satisfied, and why.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#47:1> As they are talking, re <l> member to listen for those factors you de

<l> cided were most important.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#48:1> You can then use the yellow pages for further general information, as

well as making a few pre <l> liminary phone calls to those hospitals that are

likely candidates.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#49:1> Remember to not only listen for the answers to questions you pose the

staff, but also how the person is answering them.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#50:1> Is he or she cordial and understanding, or short and snappy?
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#51:1> Can you understand what is said, or are there so many medical terms

used it sounds like a foreign language? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#52:1> Through these calls, you should be able to narrow your choices

down to two or three possibilities.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#53:1> Even if you think you've narrowed it down to one, don't make a final

decision until you have visited the facilities, preferably without your pet.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#54:1> While making the initial phone calls, if you find a hospital that

seems to fit your needs, ask them if you could take a short tour of the

facility. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#55:1> <h> <bold> Providing regular preventive care </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#56:1> Since the best age to bring a new puppy into your home is when he

is from eight to 12 weeks of age, this will be the time of your first visit

together to your veterinari <l> an, even if your pup is up to date with all

his vaccinations and deworming. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#57:1> It's a good idea to have your puppy given a thorough physical

examination by your veterinarian before you agree to keep him.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#58:1> In this way, you can avoid owning a puppy that may end up having

congenital prob <l> lems, which may be more serious and in <l> volve more

extensive care than you are pre <l> pared for.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#59:1> Although a physical exam may not detect every potential problem, it

will screen out most of them. </p> <O> chart </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#60:1> Be sure to take your puppy's full set of records, which will

indicate which vaccina <l> tions and parasite exams and treatments have

already been performed.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#61:1> This will save you both time and money.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#62:1> Your veter <l> inarian will then be able to continue this important

health care regime until your puppy is fully immunized and free of worms and

other pesky parasites. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#63:1> The canine diseases your puppy should be vaccinated against are

canine distem <l> per, parvovirus, hepatitis, leptospirosis and rabies.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#64:1> Other diseases that can be pre <l> vented by vaccinations are

traceobronchi <l> tis and Lyme disease.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#65:1> Check with your vet <l> erinarian to see if these diseases are a

concern in your area. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#66:1> Annual routine examinations are then recommended; your dog's

immunity will be maintained with yearly booster shots.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#67:1> Depending on the vaccination used, rabies vaccinations may be given

every three years.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#68:1> Always be sure these immuniza <l> tions are kept current,

particularly if your dog is going to be boarded. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#69:1> It is also important to have your dog protected from heartworm.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#70:1> If your puppy is less than six months old, he may be started directly

on heartworm preventive medication.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#71:1> If he is older, your veterinari <l> an may recommend a blood test, to

be sure he is not already harbouring the par <l> asite, and then place him on

medication.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#72:1> Your vet will help you choose the right form of medication. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#73:1> The puppy visits for vaccinations and worming will usually end

when he is four to six months of age.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#74:1> The next visit should be for neutering.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#75:1> The age at which this pro <l> cedure is performed depends on whether

you have a male or female dog, and the preference of the veterinarian. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#76:1> Most veterinarians agree the best age to have a female spayed is

five to six months.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#77:1> Spaying then greatly reduces the risk of her getting mammary tumours

later in life.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#78:1> The longer you wait after this period, the greater the chance of

mammary can <l> cer developing. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#79:1> Male dogs will generally be neutered at around nine to 12 months

of age.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#80:1> Again, neutering during this time reduces the chance of prostate

problems later in life, and helps control the pet overpopulation problems

that continue to exist. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#81:1> Your dog will also need to visit the vet when an illness or

injury occurs.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#82:1> Such vis <l> its can be greatly reduced by maintaining good health

practices at home and by tak <l> ing advantage of the many preventive medical

practices now available. </p> <O> chart </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#83:1> <h> <bold> On the homefront </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#84:1> Keeping your dog in the best of health continues at home with a

sound nutri <l> tional program, adequate shelter, good grooming and the

proper amount of atten <l> tion and activity. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#85:1> One of the first and most-often-asked questions new dog owners

have is, " What should my dog or puppy eat?"
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#86:1> Your local grocery store may present a selection al <l> most as great

as the number of breeds from which you had to choose.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#87:1> Which of these do you feed?
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#88:1> Would human food do just as well? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#89:1> The first nutrition rule is " dog food for dogs, people food for

people."
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#90:1> Although an occasional treat from the table isn't likely to harm your

dog, you must be care <l> ful.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#91:1> Some dogs enticed with table scraps will hold out for more leftover

steak in favour of their regular food.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#92:1> The best ap <l> proach, especially in the early going, is to feed dog

food exclusively. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#93:1> The second rule of canine nutrition is that <quote> " you get

what you pay for." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#94:1> In other words, bargain brands aren't really bar <l> gains.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#95:1> The less expensive dog foods are cheaper because they have more

fillers in them, which means your dog will have to eat more to meet his

nutritional needs, resulting in more stools to clean up.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#96:1> Stick with the top brands - ideally, one of the brands that your

dog's breeder or your vet <l> erinarian recommends. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#97:1> It's also a good idea to feed one of the name-brand foods that

fits the age and 'lifestyle' of your dog.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#98:1> Start your young <l> ster on one of the higher calorie puppy foods

balanced for the rapid growth a pup <l> py experiences.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#99:1> If your grown dog is very active, feed one of the foods that are

slight <l> ly higher in protein; your older, more sed <l> entary dog should

be fed a senior diet low <l> er in calories. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#100:1> Another important nutritional need is fresh water.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#101:1> Be sure your pet always has an ample supply of clean water that is

changed often - at least once per day.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#102:1> It is not a good idea to try to limit the number of times your puppy

wets on the carpet by reducing the amount of water you give. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#103:1> While talking about nutrition, let's not forget another

important aspect of your pup's health: his teeth.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#104:1> Yes, dogs need den <l> tal care much like their owners.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#105:1> Unfortu <l> nately, dogs aren't able to care for their teeth without

some help from us.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#106:1> It's im <l> portant to start a home dental program early, even

before the puppy really needs it, so he can get used to the regimen.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#107:1> Start by getting your pup accustomed to having your hands around his

face and mouth without him nipping at you.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#108:1> Then, move up to some light brushing using a finger wrapped in gauze

or a soft toothbrush.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#109:1> These early brushings should be short and light, increasing in time

and 'seriousness.' </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#110:1> Once your dog is accustomed to this process, be sure to brush

his teeth fre <l> quently, at least two to three times per week.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#111:1> It's fine to supplement the brushing with an occasional dog biscuit

and chew toys, but don't depend on them to do the job alone.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#112:1> They won't.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#113:1> Regular brushing will greatly increase the times between dental

cleanings by your veterinarian - although, just as with our own teeth, even

<l> tually the plaque will need to be profes <l> sionally removed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-012#114:1> There are several products now on the market that can be used to

help you keep your pet's teeth in good shape, including special brushes,

sprays and pastes.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-012#115:1> Check with your veterinarian for these, and be sure your vet

performs a dental exam as part of your pet's annual checkup. </p> <O> picture
