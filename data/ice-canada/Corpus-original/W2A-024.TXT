<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-024#1:1> The first sector to capitalize on genetic engineering was health

care, particularly in the US.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#2:1> In 1983, 10 years after Boyer and Cohen performed the first

recombinant DNA experiment, scientists cultivated large quanti <l> ties of

the human gene responsible for synthesizing insulin and marketed it as a

treatment for diabetics.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#3:1> Among the most commercially significant products to emerge since the

early 1980s, in addition to insulin, are human growth hormone ( which combats

dwarfism), alpha interferon ( an immune-system stimulator which helps ward

off disease), tissue plasmino <l> gen activator ( which can dissolve blood

clots in heart-attack patients), a hepatitis-B vaccine, Ortho <w>

Pharmaceuticals' </w> OKT-3 ( which helps prevent kidney transplant

rejection), and a drug called Epogen ( which fights ane <l> mia).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#4:1> Annual worldwide sales of just these seven products have reached

&dollar;1.25 billion US ( Gianturco 208).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#5:1> Worldwide sales of all biotechnology products last year reached

&dollar;6 billion.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#6:1> By the turn of the century sales are expected to soar to more than

&dollar;100 billion ( <it> Canadian Biotech </it> 12). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-024#7:1> That remarkable growth is now being fuelled by rapidly evolving

patent legislation.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#8:1> In perhaps the most sensational event in the brief history of modern

biotechnology, the US Patent and Trademark Office in 1987 passed a policy

stating that it <quote> " considers non-naturally occurring nonhu <l> man

multicellular living organisms, including animals, to be patentable subject

matter" </quote> ( Wallis 78).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#9:1> That declaration prompted fierce opposition from animal-rights

activists who feared the policy would promote the exploratory production of

misfit animals incapable of fighting pain or dis <l> ease.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#10:1> In Canada, after 10 years of controversy, Parliament this summer

passed Bill C-15, the plant <w> breeders' </w> rights act.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#11:1> Though not as sweeping as the US policy, the legislation for the

first time puts plant breeders on a par with inventors of machinery and

manufacturing processes, permitting them to protect their new plant varieties

with 18-year patents.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#12:1> As a result, plant breeders will not only be able to collect

royalties for the seeds they sell but also for the seed adult plants

subsequently produce.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#13:1> Since the bill was introduced in its original form by the liberal

government in 1980, some farm groups, led by the National <w> Farmers' </w>

Union, have been insist <l> ing it will hand over control of the food supply

to a handful of large multi-national corporations. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-024#14:1> Even in the absence of incentive legislation, however, the

Canadian biotechnology industry's growth to date has been impressive.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#15:1> Sales of Canadian biotechnology products reached &dollar;660 million

in 1988, while the industry as a whole posted a net after-tax loss of only

&dollar;3 million, a remarkably strong performance for an infant industry

that is having to invest considerably in manufacturing facilities and

marketing efforts.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#16:1> Dur <l> ing that same year, Canada's biotechnology companies spent a

substantial &dollar;275 million on research and development.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#17:1> While many of Canada's biotechnology enterprises are newly created

departments of large indus <l> trial firms, most are privately owned

start-ups employing fewer than 50 people. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-024#18:1> Building on Canada's historical strength in agricultural,

metallurgical, and forestry research, the industry is distinguished by its

primary focus on resource-based products and by its diversity.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#19:1> A recent survey of the indus <l> try sponsored by the Department of

Industry, Science and Technology and the National Research Council ( NRC )

reveals that: <l> <X> <quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#X20:1> The products and processes invented and sold by Canadian

biotechnology compa <l> nies involve nearly every industrial sector.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#X21:1> They include cloned varieties of orna <l> mental plants, bioleaching

in the mining of uranium and gold, quick tip-of-the-tongue tests to measure

blood alcohol, anaerobic digestion systems for the treatment of pulp mill

effluents, the world's first conjugate vaccine, cattle improvement through

nuclear transplantation and embryo cloning, monoclonal antibodies for blood

typing, soil microbes to improve plant growth, diagnostic kits for AIDS, the

brewing of beer, biological pesticides, and mass production of bio <l>

logical reagents from eggs and plants. ( <it> Canadian Biotech </it> 1)

</quote> </p> </X>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-024#22:1> According to that survey, more than 10,000 products are currently

under development, 76% of which are being developed by seed compa <l> nies.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-024#23:1> The Canadian industry's plans for future growth are equally

impres <l> sive.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#24:1> Companies plan to spend almost &dollar;7 million each on new manufac

<l> turing facilities by 1992.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#25:1> By the same year, the industry expects to hire 5,000 new employees,

nearly doubling its 1989 work-force.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#26:1> Sales are expected to grow at an average annual rate of 46% between

1988 and 1992, reaching &dollar;5 billion.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#27:1> The expectations seem realistic, too.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#28:1> About half of the 220 companies involved in biotechnology in Canada

reported net profits in 1988.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#29:1> Overall, the firms are less indebted than those of many established

industrial sectors, with an average debt-to-equity ratio in 1988 of 0.47.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#30:1> The average assets-to-liability ratio for the industry was a

relatively healthy 2.3 ( <it> Canadian Biotech </it> 6). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-024#31:1> Such statistics reveal a vibrant and remarkably strong industry.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#32:1> Yet the overall picture points to more than an increase in efficiency

and quantity of research.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#33:1> It also reflects an impressive shift in demographics.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#34:1> Private-sector involvement is rapidly growing against public-sector

activity.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#35:1> Where once research proceeded almost exclusively according to

public-policy objectives and at the discretion of government funding bodies,

private capital is fuelling an expanding proportion of the new growth.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#36:1> The dynamics of the marketplace will inevitably play an increasingly

vital role in the guidance of that growth.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#37:1> Clearly, the power and priorities of Cana <l> dian biotechnology

research are changing.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#38:1> What will some of those early priorities be, and what are the

implications for public policy? </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#39:1> <h> II </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-024#40:1> The risks associated with the progress of biotechnology can be

divided into two categories, those that arise from the research activities

themselves and those that arise from the application of its products.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#41:1> With the Canadian biotechnology industry still in its infancy, and

the bulk of its products still in development, the most imminent risks to

consider stem from the pro <l> cess, as opposed to the application, of

research.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#42:1> Ominous signs of the level of ignorance among biotechnology

researchers of the regulations that apply to their industry are already

evident.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#43:1> In the survey of 84 companies conducted by the federal government and

the NRC from November 1988 to February 1989, only 29 respondents were

familiar with the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and its implications

for industrial biotech <l> nology.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#44:1> Although ignorance of regulations will not be tolerated as a plea by

the courts, that can only be cold comfort when irresponsible practices have a

vast potential to alter - or even destroy - parts of <}> <-> the <-> <=> the

</=> </}> environ <l> ment.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#45:1> If biotechnology has the capacity to do irrevocable damage to humans

or their surroundings, retroactive enforcement through punish <l> ment could

be irrelevant.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#46:1> Measures to ensure compliance will be - and clearly already are -

essential.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#47:1> Regulatory authorities will thus have to work alongside the

industrial biotechnology community to assist in mak <l> ing every member

aware of the laws and guidelines that apply to their practices. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-024#48:1> Enforcement presents another challenge.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#49:1> As in nuclear research, the containment of potentially hazardous

material is a genuine problem, albeit only in a very small minority of cases.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#50:1> While established firms are likely to conform voluntarily with public

policies associated with research methods, smaller firms, which prevail in

biotechnology, are likely to take more risks.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#51:1> This situation stands in stark contrast to the nuclear industry

where, because of the scale required by the research and its complexity,

small companies are effectively precluded from participating.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#52:1> A sound regulatory policy should contain provisions for random

investigation of private laboratories - not unlike the scrutiny to which the

food industry is subject - to ensure that proper measures are taken to

minimize the acci <l> dental release of potentially hazardous organisms. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-024#53:1> The risks associated with the testing or application of products

in the envi <l> ronment, especially micro-organisms, represent perhaps the

most critical area for regulation ( Doyle 50).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#54:1> After all, the goal of biotechnology <it> is </it> to alter the

environment.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#55:1> Concerns for the long-term, broad ecological impact of biotechnology

will have special relevance to Canadian research and development, where the

vast majority of products are emerging from the natural-resource sectors,

particularly agriculture.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#56:1> Monitoring and con <l> trolling the effects of that alteration will

be the key issues. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#57:1> <h> III </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-024#58:1> When considering ramifications of the products of biotechnology,

the vast majority of which have yet to enter the market, an immediate dilemma

presents itself.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#59:1> Is it possible to regulate effectively an enterprise in which

potential risks have yet to be uncovered?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#60:1> The constant pressure to antici <l> pate risks means regulatory

agencies must place strong emphasis on the evolution of policy itself.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#61:1> The explosive growth of the industry underscores the urgency of that

need.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#62:1> Co-operation from private industry would help identify areas of

potential public concern, but it is insufficient.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#63:1> Neutral expertise is critical.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#64:1> In an era when so many publicly-funded research institutions have

seen their direct government support diminish against the growth of even

moderately expanding industries, and have seen their historical neutrality

compromised by the growing tendency to make federal funding for research

contingent upon industrial invest <l> ment, the capacity of the vibrant

private biotechnology industry seems poised to outstrip the resources of

those very scientists whose indepen <l> dent expertise will be critical for

informing public policy.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#65:1> Even if funding for public research were to be maintained at a

relatively high level of 4%-6% of real growth, it is hardly a match for the

46% annual rate at which the industry plans to expand.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#66:1> Government and university research efforts in biotechnology cannot be

allowed to languish in their present state of underfunding.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#67:1> Among other things, public and university laboratories will have to

step up research into mathematical modelling and controlled-field testing in

order to establish a predictive ecology before widespread release takes

place. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-024#68:1> Another systematic trend that may compromise the goal of a sound

and publicly supported regulatory system is evident in the the manner in

which the newly formed National Biotechnology Advisory Committee operates -

namely, under the auspices of the federal Department of Industry, Science and

Technology.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#69:1> A founding priority of this department is to promote the <quote> "

development, exploitation and applications of strategic technologies to

improve Canada's international competitiveness" </quote> ( <quote> " Regu <l>

latory Concerns" </quote> ) .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#70:1> Environment Canada, on the other hand, has no such mandate, and its

advice ought to take a prime role in the formulation of regulations.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#71:1> Can the Department of Industry, Science and Technology and the

regulatory advisory body it oversees continue to be regarded as neutral

sources of scrutiny by the biotechnology industry's present critics, while

that department offers direct or indirect subsidies to industry and publicly

champions industry's attempts to become globally competitive? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-024#72:1> Even more important, because more than three-quarters of the prod

<l> ucts under development in Canada fall into the category of seed research,

Canadian regulations will require specific attention to the impact of this

research on accidental transmission and genetic diversity.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#73:1> Plant research, unlike chemical, pharmaceutical, and animalian

research, will in many cases require widespread dispersal of experimental

genetic material into the environment.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#74:1> Geographically dispersed material is generally more sus <l> ceptible

to the influences of a host of uncontrollable environmental factors, such as

bioleaching into soil and transport by wind, micro-organisms, and animals.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#75:1> Measures for assessing the potential of accidental transport, as well

as the eventual fate of experimental material in the environment, will be

crucial. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-024#76:1> Because agricultural applications of biotechnology can be

expected to produce key crops with higher commercial value, it can be

expected that biotechnology companies will find willing customers in the

Canadian farming industry.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#77:1> Measures should be taken to ensure that any reduction in genetic

diversity through the widespread planting of these key crops will not make

the food supply more susceptible to genetic diseases.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#78:1> This may entail preserving a greater number of existing varieties in

seed banks.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#79:1> The potential for lost diversity also raises an interesting question

for the issue of farm support.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#80:1> Will farmers who attempt to remain competitive by planting only those

crops with the highest commercial value be required to bear the burden of

sudden losses to their incomes if their crops are wiped out by disease? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-024#81:1> Insurance against such catastrophes might be obtained in another,

potentially more controversial way.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#82:1> Even if consumers show a strong demand for new <quote> " super"

</quote> varieties, it is possible to <it> promote </it> the desirable goal

of genetic diversity by taxing the consumption of these crops.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#83:1> While the idea of limiting consumer choice through disincentives

might seem antithetical to a market-driven economy, it is nevertheless

consistent with a society that places high value on environmental security

and human health.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#84:1> Many western societies have already set precedents for

market-intervention where public health and safety have been concerned.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#85:1> Tobacco taxes, despite their threat to some <w> farmers' </w>

interests, have enjoyed widespread public support in many countries,

including Canada.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#86:1> Would it be unthinkable, then, to impose taxes on crop varieties

that, because of their popularity, limit diversity and thus threaten the food

supply?
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#87:1> It has been suggested in the case of tobacco, and not without

reasonable justifi <l> cation, that a portion of the proceeds from taxes be

diverted to hospitals for the treatment of cancer and heart disease.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-024#88:1> Would it be unreasonable to divert the proceeds from taxes on popular

crops toward maintaining seed banks? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-024#89:1> As important as any specific regulatory consideration, finally,

is the active participation of the public throughout the advisory process.
