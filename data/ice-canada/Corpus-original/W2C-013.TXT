<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#2:1> By Zena Olijnyk </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#3:1> As a packed courtroom listened in stunned silence, Brian Jack was

found guilty yesterday and sentenced to life in prison for second-degree

murder in the disappearance of his wife Christine. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#4:1> <h> <bold> <ul> Marriage ends in murder </ul> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#5:1> After 4 1/2 hours of deliberation following a 10-week trial, the

two-man, nine-woman Court of Queen's Bench jury returned and said Jack killed

his wife. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#6:1> The 33-year-old speech therapist and mother of two went missing on

Dec. 17, 1988, after a domestic dispute with her husband. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#7:1> After hearing the jury's verdict, Chief Justice Ben Hewak of Court

of Queen's Bench sentenced Jack to life in prison with no eligibility of

parole for 10 years. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#8:1> The jury made no recommendation on sentencing, although it could

have suggested Jack not be eligible for parole for between 10 and 25 years.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#9:1> It also could have found Jack guilty of manslaughter. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#10:1> When the verdict was pronounced, Jack, 43, a former tight end for

the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, slumped in the prisoner's box, visibly shocked.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#11:1> Jack, tall and athletic, spent Thursday night in the Winnipeg

Remand Centre after the jury was sequestered following a 9 1/2-hour charge to

the jury.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#12:1> He looked dishevelled and flushed as the verdict was handed down.

<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#13:2> <h> <bold> City's water supply safe, Filmon says </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#14:2> By John Douglas </bold>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#15:2> <h> Winnipeg Free Press </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#16:2> OTTAWA - Ontario and Manitoba have agreed to negotiate a

long-term agreement that will protect Winnipeg's drinking water supply from

future economic development, Premier Gary Filmon said yesterday. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#17:2> If officials can conclude the work started yesterday during a

75-minute " courtesy call" on Ontario Premier Bob Rae, Filmon said,

Winnipeggers might never have to worry about commercial developments

endangering the quality of water from Shoal Lake in northwestern Ontario.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#18:2> For more than two years, Filmon tried to negotiate a deal with

the Ontario Liberal government to ensure a Toronto firm is prevented from

developing a gold mine operation on the lake. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#19:2> He got that assurance and more yesterday in his first meeting

with the newly elected NDP premier. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#20:2> " We may embark on some additional matters to do with long-term

assurance of protection so that we not only deal with the current project of

the mining but that we look at the longer term of having an overall

management agreement of the water supply," Filmon said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#21:2> " Mr. Rae has assured us of his full co-operation and commitment

to utilize their environmental act to protect Winnipeg's water supply." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#22:2> An official in Rae's office confirmed the two leaders would like

an agreement that would protect the environment. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#23:2> " Premier Rae gave his personal commitment that when faced with

the issue of a gold mine or drinking water, people came first," the official

said on the condition he not <}> <-> he </-> <+> be </+> </}> identified.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#24:2> Co-operation characterized what Filmon called <quote> " a very

optimistic, positive first meeting." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#25:2> The premiers reaffirmed a &dollar;13-billion, multi-year

agreement that would have Manitoba supply large quantities of hydroelectric

power to Ontario. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#26:3> <h> <bold> Courtroom soap opera leaves 'ghoulish' fans with appetite

for more </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#27:3> By Zena Olijnyk </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#28:3> The Brian Jack trial was real life soap opera that spectators say

they couldn't get enough of and sheepishly admit they're sorry is over. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#29:3> " It's almost like having an old friend.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#30:3> You get used to building your day around it," said one 62-year-old

woman, who asked not be named. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#31:3> " I know it must seem ghoulish when you consider that a man's

future is at stake, but you just get so caught up in what's going to happen

next," said the woman, a regular at the 10-week trial. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#32:3> She was just one of the countless spectators who jammed into the

66-seat courtroom at Winnipeg's Law Courts Building since the trial started

Sept. 10, especially in the last few days when the final arguments of Crown

attorney Jack Montgomery and defence <}> <-> lawyere </-> <+> lawyer </+>

</}> Richard Wolson held them spellbound. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#33:3> On some days, spectators started lining up as early as 8:30 a.m.,

when the Law Courts Building opens.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#34:3> And many of those who came on time still didn't get a seat. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#35:3> <quote> " I waited and waited for someone to come out, but no one

did for a long time," </quote> said another woman who also didn't want to be

identified.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#36:3> " I guess once people got in, they stuck to their seats like glue."

<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#37:4> <h> <bold> Man shot after pointing toy gun at police </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#38:4> By Paul Wiecek </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#39:4> The brother of a local Metis leader was shot in the head by a

Winnipeg police officer early yesterday after he pointed a toy handgun at two

officers, police said. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#40:4> <h> <ul> Man 'happy not drunk' </ul> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#41:4> Dan Wilson Delaronde, 42, was in the Health Sciences Centre

intensive care unit in critical condition last night recovering from a single

bullet wound to his head. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#42:4> Delaronde is the brother of Billyjo Delaronde, executive director

of the Manitoba Metis Federation. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#43:4> Deputy chief Paul Johnston told a news conference yesterday

morning Delaronde was shot by a police constable at about 12:30 a.m. after he

pointed what the officer believed to <}> <-> he </-> <+> be </+> </}> a

handgun at him and his partner. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#44:4> The gun turned out to be a large, black plastic imitation, but

Johnston said it appeared to be authentic and the officer - a 10-year veteran

- fired his service revolver in what he believed was self-defence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#45:4> The shooting climaxed a bizarre chain of events which began

shortly after midnight when a man called a Manitoba Telephone System operator

from a phone in the New West Hotel, 786 Main Street. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#46:4> Johnston said the man, who police believe was Delaronde, was

<quote> " threatening violence" </quote> and the operator referred the

information along with the origin of the call to a 911 operator in the

department's communication centre. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#47:4> Johnston refused to elaborate on the specific nature of the

threats or to say how police later determined the caller was Delaronde. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#48:4> He said officers from the department's crime division are

investigating the shooting and a report will be submitted next week for

consideration by a panel of senior officers. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#49:5> <h> <bold> Workers rise from ashes of dead plant. </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#50:5> By George Nikides </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#51:5> Driving past the abandoned and moss-covered Canada Packers plant

on Marion Street, former workers talk about broken marriages, suicide and

poverty. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#52:5> But the reality for many who once sliced bacon and beef on the

killing floor is less traumatic - they survived the slaughter by taking

lower-paying jobs, attending classes, and finding new careers. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#53:5> More than 900 workers had lost their jobs by the time Canada

Packers Ltd. shut its doors on March 25, 1988, the largest plant shutdown in

Manitoba history. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#54:5> " The first year was really the pits," said Carole Johnston, 56,

who spent 37 years at the plant.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#55:5> " It was the unknown.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#56:5> What will you do?
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#57:5> What can you do?" </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#58:5> <h> <ul> Older employees hardest hit </ul> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#59:5> Johnston, who lied about her age at 15 to land her first job at

Canada Packers, said she now lives <quote> " comfortably" </quote> on an

older worker's pension in a basement apartment in St. Boniface. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#60:5> " What the hell can you do when you're 56?
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#61:5> Kids aren't getting jobs today." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#62:5> She still suffers from an arm injury - one of her gloves became

stuck in a reduction machine at the plant - and through force of habit wakes

up at 5 a.m., as she did for her shifts at Canada Packers. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#63:5> " It was one of the better things to happen to me," said Greg

Zembik, a 35-year-old former packer who managed to find a sales job after

taking a business course. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#64:5> " I wouldn't want to have spent the rest of my life there.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#65:5> When you're young, the money is so good you don't want to leave.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#66:5> That's why so many people stayed there so long." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#67:5> " To a lot of people, there was no life after Canada Packers."

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#68:5> The money was good at Canada Packers, anywhere from &dollar;8 to

&dollar;16 an hour. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#69:5> In interviews, former workers said some of their colleagues,

especially older people with little education, had gone broke, seen their

families fall apart or suffered nervous breakdowns. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#70:5> They also knew of former workers who had taken their own lives.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#71:5> But all those interviewed said they themselves were living

comfortably, but modestly. </p> <O> rest of article completed on another page

<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#72:6> <h> <bold> Ministers offer ray of hope for Portage </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#73:6> By Brenda Suderman </bold>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#74:6> Winnipeg Free Press

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#75:6> PORTAGE LA PRAIRIE - Two federal cabinet ministers kicked the

door open yesterday to the possibility the military base may not leave this

community in 1992. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#76:6> Both Energy Minister Jake Epp and Western Diversification

Minister Charlie Mayer said the federal cabinet has yet to decide whether to

name Portage as the only site for military flight training in coming tender

documents. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#77:6> " It was important for us to have these points made directly to

us again as we move into the decision-making period on Southport ( base),"

Epp said after a breakfast meeting with community leaders. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#78:6> " I think we've simply had some more updates on that information

and have strengthened the resolve of the Manitoba ( federal Conservative)

caucus." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#79:6> At the meeting, Chamber of Commerce president Brian Pallister

made an impassioned plea to the ministers to fight to keep military flight

training in Portage. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#80:6> " I would like you to take away the uncertainty, I would like you

to take away the fear," he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#81:6> " I am proud, but I'm not too proud to beg you to make Portage

site-specific." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#82:6> Ottawa plans to privatize basic flight training in 1992 as a

cost-cutting measure.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#83:6> Several companies have expressed interest in bidding on the contract,

but the operation could leave the Portage airbase. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#84:6> Conservative MP Felix Holtmann ( Portage-Interlake) said the

interest aerospace companies have shown in the Portage facility proves it's

the best place for military flight training. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#85:6> " I think we're past the phase of base closure and looking toward

a transition and looking at it being a positive answer," Holtmann said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#86:6> " If you do your homework in Portage and have a very much of a

united effort, then it's up to those of us in government to deliver on your

behalf," Mayer said. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#87:7> <h> <bold> Kenora fears bypass to draw business away </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#88:7> By Bain Gain </bold>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#89:7> Despite modifications made to the &dollar;57 million bypass

around Kenora, which opened yesterday, businesses in the town will suffer

losses, says the president of the Chamber of Commerce. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#90:7> Wayne Marcino said they might even exceed dire predictions in a

1989 study that &dollar;10 million in revenues will be lost annually. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#91:7> " It might even he higher than that.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#92:7> Maybe it's going to be &dollar;20 million or &dollar;40 million," he

said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#93:7> " The bottom line is that business is going to suffer." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#94:7> Business people and the municipality successfully lobbied the

Ontario government for &dollar;5.5 million worth of changes in the original

construction plans, said Kenora <}> <-> Coun. </-> <+> Counsillor </+> </}>

Mark Duggan.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#95:7> The changes were designed to funnel travellers into town. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#96:7> " The tri-municipal areas are as prepared as they could be for

it," said Duggan, who is also executive director of the Sunset Country Travel

Association. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#97:7> The design changes at the intersection of the old Trans-Canada

Highway and the bypass makes the existing route into town the most obvious

choice for motorists, he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#98:7> Traffic signs along the new road, which circles eight kilometres

north of Kenora, should also funnel more cars into town, he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#99:7> The province agreed to designate the bypass as alternate route

17A, he said, and retain the main route number 17 for the highway into town.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#100:7> Townsfolk originally lobbied the provincial government to build

the bypass because truck traffic was causing problems downtown. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#101:7> But tourists as well as truckers will bypass the communities of

Kenora, Jaffray-Malick and Keewatin, said David Treusch, director of the Lake

of the Woods Economic Development Corp. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-013#102:7> " Those businesses which are heavily dependent on highway

traffic might have to change their business focus.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-013#103:7> For instance, instead of selling trinkets they might want to move

into more upscale items." </p> </I>
