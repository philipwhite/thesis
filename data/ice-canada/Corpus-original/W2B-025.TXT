<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-025#4:1> AT 8 O'CLOCK ON THE MORNING OF June 5, 1992, DENISE ROCHEAU, A

28-YEAR-OLD QUEBEC CITY woman, was wheeled into an operating room at the

University of Michigan Medical Cen <l> ter in Ann Arbor.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#5:1> A heavy black mask was placed over her nose and mouth, and taking

direction, she began inhaling deep drafts of an anaesthetic.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#6:1> Waiting for the patient to lose consciousness, a team of about a dozen

medical experts, briefed to the final detail, made a last in <l> spection of

the high-tech apparatus scattered around the room.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#7:1> Off to the side, the team's leader, Jim Wilson, a tall, boyish-looking

doctor, watched intently. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-025#8:1> A mother who worked as a seam-stress and part-time bank teller,

Denise ( a pseudonym to conceal her identity) suffered from a deadly

inherited heart disorder called familial hypercholes <l> terolaemia ( FH).
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#9:1> FH is caused by the lack of an essential gene in the liver that helps

remove " bad" choles <l> terol - the type that sticks to artery walls and

clogs blood vessels - from the bloodstream.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#10:1> The dis <l> ease had already killed two of her brothers and had been

responsible for her heart attack at the age of 16.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#11:1> Either with great faith or in great desperation, Denise agreed to be

a human guinea pig in a medical fantasy now being brought to life by gene

therapist Jim Wilson.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#12:1> She was gambling that Wilson and his team could safely treat the

disease by replac <l> ing her fatally flawed genes with new ones.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#13:1> Failure could cost Denise her life.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#14:1> Success would usher in a revolution in modern medicine more sweeping

than the dis <l> covery of vaccines or antibiotics. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-025#15:1> With clinical precision, lead sur <l> geon Steve Raper dragged

his scalpel across Denise's skin just below the rib cage, producing a crimson

streak.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#16:1> Raper then cut through layers of ab <l> dominal tissue until he

reached his tar <l> get, Denise's liver.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#17:1> He paused, probed for a lobe of the vital organ, and cut away a

255-gram section while the as <l> sisting surgeon hastened to stop the

bleeding.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#18:1> To the naked eye, there was nothing to suggest that this hand-sized

slab of pinkish brown tissue harboured a fatal genetic defect that caused De

<l> nise to have cholesterol levels three times greater than normal.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#19:1> The severed lobe hung from a pair of forceps and then dropped into a

plastic bag that rested in a basin filled with ice.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#20:1> Wilson grabbed the container, tucked it under his arm like a

football, and rushed to a laboratory where his colleague, Mari <l> ann

Grossman, was ready to begin the exacting process of inserting healthy genes

into the patient's liver. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-025#21:1> It would take four intense days of activity in the medical

centre's labora <l> tories, operating room, and intensive-care unit before

the gene-therapy pro <l> cedure was completed, and several months more before

Wilson was cer <l> tain that the new genes were bringing about a lasting

improvement in Denise's cholesterol levels.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#22:1> Early this spring, nearly two years after the op <l> eration, Wilson,

Grossman, and their gene-therapy team made medical his <l> tory when they

published the results of the experiment in the scientific jour <l> nal <it>

Nature Genetics </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#23:1> Their landmark re <l> port, which made front-page headlines around

the world, was the first to show the lasting therapeutic benefits of gene

therapy for a patient with a life-threat <l> ening inherited disease. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-025#24:1> Wilson was able to report that De <l> nise's harmful-cholesterol

levels had dropped by almost 20 percent after gene therapy and that the level

of " good" cholesterol was raised signifi <l> cantly.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#25:1> She was administered a choles <l> terol-lowering drug, which had not

worked prior to the treatment, and her harmful cholesterol dropped by about

30 percent overall from pre-treatment levels, although it still re <l> mained

at more than twice normal levels.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#26:1> The most encouraging news, however, was that her cholesterol had

remained low for the full 28 months since she had received the treatment.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#27:1> Since Denise's operation, four other FH patients have undergone

Wilson's experimental gene therapy: a 12-year-old boy from Cyprus, an

8-year-old girl from Colombia, an 11-year-old girl from China, and a

41-year-old woman from Quebec.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#28:1> The results of these treatments should be known by the end of 1994.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-025#29:1> <quote> " We've demonstrated the long-term safety and

effectiveness of gene therapy in this patient," </quote> says Wilson. <X>

<quote> " By doing so, we have opened the doors for the potential of gene

therapy in treating vari <l> ous forms of inherited lethal dis <l> orders.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#X30:1> I believe that gene ther <l> apy will become a part of every medical

discipline." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-025#31:1> At 39, Jim Wilson is in the van <l> guard of a generation of

scientists whose ability to manipulate and reconstruct DNA in the labora <l>

tory gives them the power to alter the genetic makeup of people.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#32:1> In biological terms, gene therapy uses DNA information technology to

re-program human cells in the hope of correcting critical genetic-coding er

<l> rors.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#33:1> A few years ago, the idea of using gene therapy to treat patients

with life-threatening diseases was an excit <l> ing but only theoretical

possibility.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#34:1> Today, gene therapy is one of the hottest areas of medical research.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#35:1> More than 70 clinical trials are under way in the United States,

Great Britain, Italy, and China, and a number of tests are being planned

across Canada.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#36:1> Trials in <l> clude Wilson's treatment of five FH patients and a

second major test in which he plans to treat 22 patients with cystic fibrosis

( CF), the most com <l> mon genetic disease among Caucasians. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-025#37:1> Gene therapy excites medical re <l> searchers because, in theory,

it offers a way to treat the root cause of any in <l> herited disease,

including many fatal illnesses for which there is currently no effective

treatment or cure.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#38:1> Instead of treating the symptoms that result from a genetic defect,

gene therapy seeks to correct the problem at the source and, in this way,

provide a lasting cure. <O> picture </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#39:1> Gene therapy offers new hope in the seemingly one-sided battle

against some 4,000 inherited diseases that are known to result from a

defective single gene.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#40:1> The better-known ones include muscular dystro <l> phy, CF,

sickle-cell anaemia, Tay-Sachs disease, and amyotrophic lateral scle <l>

rosis ( Lou Gehrig's disease). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-025#41:1> The potential applications of gene therapy go far beyond

single-gene dis <l> orders.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#42:1> Genetic defects are also known or suspected to play a role in

society's most common and deadliest diseases, including many types of cancer,

Alzheimer's disease, haemophilia, and diabetes.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#43:1> In many instances, the un <l> derlying genetic basis of the illness

is not yet understood and may involve a complex interaction of several genes.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#44:1> As the processes become known, re <l> searchers hope that gene

therapy will help correct the conditions. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-025#45:1> But for all its huge promise, human gene therapy has been thin on

hard clinical data to show that it works.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#46:1> Scientists such as 57-year-old French Anderson, who led the first

government-approved human gene-therapy trial four years ago, have been theo

<l> rizing about it since the late 1960s.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#47:1> That's when Anderson sent an article on the subject to <it> The New

England Journal of Medicine </it> , where it was rejected after a heated

debate. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-025#48:1> Why did it take 25 years before Jim Wilson could successfully

apply the concept of gene therapy for the first time?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#49:1> In theory, the idea is simple: Just insert a healthy gene to do the

work of a defective gene.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#50:1> In reality, gene ther <l> apy is anything but simple.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#51:1> First, sci <l> entists must find and clone the right gene among a

hundred thousand oth <l> ers packed into the DNA in each human cell.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#52:1> Second, they must be able to deliver the right genes safely into the

right target cells, in either the bloodstream, liver, lung, or brain.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#53:1> Then they must get the transplanted genes to work properly in order

to correct the biochemical breakdown that causes the disease. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-025#54:1> Finding a gene is enormously difficult.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#55:1> As the basic units of heredity, genes are segments of DNA in the nu

<l> cleus of each cell that contain instruc <l> tions to make proteins, the

basic build <l> ing blocks of life.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#56:1> The famous DNA double helix is a winding molecular ladder three

billion rungs long.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#57:1> A spe <l> cific gene can be a segment of DNA that is as short as a

thousand rungs or as long as several hundred thousand rungs.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#58:1> Gene hunter Francis Collins likes to observe that locating a gene is

much harder than finding a needle in a haystack.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#59:1> The needle stands out be <l> cause it looks different, but a gene is

just another piece of DNA. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-025#60:1> Until the 1980s, only a few of the genes that cause single-gene

disorders had been cloned.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#61:1> These included the adenosine deaminase ( ADA) gene that causes severe

combined immune defi <l> ciency ( SCID); the gene that causes Lesch-Nyhan

syndrome, a rare de <l> generative disease of the nervous sys <l> tem; and

the beta globin gene that causes thalassaemia, a deadly blood disorder common

among Mediter <l> ranean peoples. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-025#62:1> At first, each of these diseases was considered a potential

candidate for human gene therapy.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#63:1> The idea was so tantalizing that Martin Cline, a bril <l> liant and

ambitious California scientist, conducted a rogue experimental gene-therapy

trial in the summer of 1980.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#64:1> Cline, who had been denied permission to conduct human trials in the

United States, secretly flew to Israel and Italy, where he inserted beta

globin genes into two young women afflicted with thalassaemia.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#65:1> As it turned out, Cline had also misled the Israeli ethics-re <l>

view committee about the methods he was using.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#66:1> The research superstar lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in

grants after U.S. funding authorities found out about the tests. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-025#67:1> The Cline fiasco highlighted both the severe technical

limitations of gene therapy at the time and the need for a new government

regulatory body to review the technical and eth <l> ical merits of any

proposed human gene-therapy trials in the future. In 1980, scientists had not

cloned many genes, nor had they developed effec <l> tive methods for

transferring genes into human cells and getting those genes to work.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#68:1> The technical hurdles were so great that in 1981, French Anderson,

one of gene therapy's strongest proponents, abandoned re <l> search for

several years.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#69:1> With Ander <l> son temporarily out of the field, Richard Mulligan, a

young researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Tech <l> nology ( MIT) in

Boston, filled the void. <O> picture </O> <O> With tools of his trade, Jim

Wilson examines cultures. Wilson was the first to show lasting benefits of

gene therapy for the inherited disease. </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#70:1> He showed that specialized retroviruses could perform the critical

job of delivering genes into animal and then human cells and getting the

genes to work.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#71:1> The retroviruses, really bundles of genes and proteins, act like

molecular delivery vans that attach to a target cell and then insert the

healthy gene that they carry into the DNA of the host cell.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#72:1> In Mulligan's laboratory, genetically engineered mouse leukemia

retroviruses success <l> fully delivered human genes into mouse DNA.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#73:1> The finding electrified the still young gene-therapy field. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-025#74:1> In the fall of 1990, French Ander <l> son, Michael Blaese, and

Kenneth Culver at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH) in Bethesda,

Maryland, performed the first human gene-ther <l> apy trial when they treated

two girls with SCID.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#75:1> The girls were born with a mutant chromosone that kept them from

producing the ADA enzyme.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#76:1> Without the enzyme, the body can <l> not produce new T-cells ( a type

of white blood cell) to fight disease, leav <l> ing the children defenceless

against in <l> fection.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#77:1> In a widely publicized exper <l> iment, the NIH team used genetically

engineered retroviruses to put normal ADA genes into the <w> girls' </w>

deficient T-cells.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#78:1> The hope was that the chil <l> dren's new T-cells would begin mak <l>

ing enough ADA to boost their im <l> mune systems.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#79:1> Four years after the initial treatments, the first gene-ther <l> apy

trial remains controversial because no scientific paper has been published

showing the trial's results. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-025#80:1> Scientists were just learning how to manipulate genes when Wilson

en <l> tered the University of Michigan's M.D./Ph.D. program in 1978, but it

was an area that fascinated him.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#81:1> As part of his research with geneticist Bill Kelley, Wilson helped

discover the genetic flaw that causes Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a devastating

inherited dis <l> ease that leads to mental retardation and compulsive

self-mutilation in boys.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#82:1> Wilson vividly recalls how ex <l> cited and happy he was when he told

families whose children had Lesch-Nyhan about his discovery of the mu <l>

tant gene, only to be greeted with dis <l> appointment from one mother:

<quote> " She didn't respond.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#83:1> Then she asked me, <quote> " How will this help my kids?" </quote> "

</quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#84:1> All Wilson could say was, <quote> " It won't." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#85:1> To treat Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, gene therapists must overcome the huge

obstacle of effectively delivering genes into brain cells.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-025#86:1> The incident brought home to Wilson very early in his ca <l> reer the

huge gap between finding and fixing a gene. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-025#87:1> During the 1980s, Wilson eagerly followed the viral-engineering

break-throughs of Richard Mulligan. </p> </I>
