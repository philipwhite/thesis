<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#1:1> <h> <bold> Unmet needs </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#2:1> In our organization, we have two facets to our computing function.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#3:1> On one side there are those hired to develop applica <l> tions -

they are programmer / analysts in the traditional sense.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#4:1> The other side is there to support our expanding base of PC users.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#5:1> We call them PC support specialists. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#6:1> The last time I checked, both groups were running around

furiously.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#7:1> I'm not sure why but it must of had to do something with

mission-critical applications, whatever that is. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#8:1> The reason for my concern is I needed something done.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#9:1> I wanted a certain kind of software loaded on my machine.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#10:1> It's not a big request but I suppose it ranks about number 112 on

their list of priorities. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#11:1> At our company, there is probably an argument for having two

groups responsible for our systems.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#12:1> In theory, it should work. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#13:1> But where the whole systems breaks down is this growing list of

unmet end-user requests. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#14:1> A co-worker needs a modem installed so she can work at home.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#15:1> Another fellow wants to upgrade his PC with a color monitor.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#16:1> A third is having troubles with a hard drive.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#17:1> And to top it off, I have a boss who can produce a one-inch thick

stack of printed e-mail messages each representing a request to the PC

support supervisor. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#18:1> These are requests that I know of, these are the ones from our

department.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#19:1> Now multiply that by all the other users in all the other departments

and what you have is a rather large backlog. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#20:1> Our IS function, such that it is, simply is facing more demands

than it can satisfy.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#21:1> And it is, however undeserved, getting a reputation for

unresponsiveness. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#22:1> I'm told, many, if not most organizations, are experienc <l> ing

similar frustrations. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#23:1> My concern is that IS has been so preoccupied with " serving"

others, aiming to please but forgetting all that is promised, that I, typical

end-user, have become reluctant to add to their list. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#24:1> So what do you do?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#25:1> The obvious answer is to add more resources and more people.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#26:1> That's not popular in these days of cutting back. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#27:1> A second would be to make users more self-sufficient but I'm

afraid co-workers would resist any attempt to be transformed into " techies."

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#28:1> A third is to involve end-users more in the judicious use of

resources that always seem to be limited and to help our technical people set

priorities. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#29:1> I think that maybe our computer department, or any IS

organization, would be better off if it was run like a business. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#30:1> This does not at all imply that you want to turn IS into a profit

centre.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#31:1> But what it means is doing a better job of telling your IS personnel

exactly what is you do to make money - so they can discern between "

strategic" use of their time and what is a meaningless digression. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#32:1> And it means accountability, to other departments and to upper

management, and depending on your type of business, to customers or suppliers

as well. </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#34:2> <h> <bold> Wang profits from change in focus </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#35:2> <bold> by Alison Eastwood </bold>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#36:2> <it> Computing Canada </it>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#37:2> After a turbulent 18 months beginning with the accumulation of

&dollar;575 million ( U.S.) in debt, Wang Laboratories, one of the most

successful proprietary ven <l> dors of the <w> ' 80s </w> , has a new

strategy - it wants to be liked. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#38:2> <quote> " We got away from trying to be known to a core base of

customers, and we just used our name to get to everybody who wanted word

processing," </quote> ad <l> mits acting president of Wang Canada, Vaughn

McIntyre. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#39:2> Most of the Fortune 1000 companies in Canada have at one time or

another dealt with Toronto-based Wang.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#40:2> However, the company's focus was on the computer marketplace rather

than on the customer.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#41:2> Even its marketing strategy was guaranteed to turn users off. </p>

<p> <quote> " We tended to have advertise <l> ments that other computer com

<l> panies would understand and know but that our customers wouldn't.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#42:2> It became a kind of one-upmanship on the plat <l> form." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#43:2> McIntyre is adamant: <quote> " We've got to change that." </quote>

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#44:2> Regaining people's trust is central to Wang's new strategy.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#45:2> McIntyre says the company will enter into new business partner <l>

ships but confesses: <quote> " Over a five-or six-year period, not unlike

some of our competitors, we do have to admit to having built up excellent

partnerships and then destroyed them with the stroke of a policy change."

</quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#46:2> At the end of 1989 Wang Canada's parent company, Wang

Laboratories Inc. of Lowell, Mass., found itself in debt to the tune of

&dollar;575 million ( U.S.).
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#47:2> <quote> " We had a very severe cash prob <l> lem," </quote> said

McIntyre.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#48:2> Restructur <l> ing the business appears to have paid off - Wang

reported a very small profit in the first quarter of ended Sept. 30, 1991,

and is hoping to build on that, al <l> though, as McIntyre is aware, <quote>

" it's going to be touch and go for a while." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#49:2> McIntyre attributes the turn-around to the refinement of Wang's

business internally and not to the response of its custom <l> ers.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#50:2> <quote> " I would not want to trick anybody into thinking that people

have flocked to our door and begun to buy just because we've cleaned up our

act," </quote> he said. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#X51:2> <quote> " We expect that to come." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#52:2> At Wang Canada, there have been major changes: director of

marketing McIntyre had to step into the shoes of president Steve Trotter, who

returned to his home country New Zealand four months ago.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#53:2> <quote> " Big disappoint <l> ment for him, because he was the basis

for some of the changes we'd made here," said McIntyre. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#X54:2> <quote> " He wanted to watch some of them happen." </quote> </X>

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#55:2> Changes include a focus on open standards and a push towards the

image processing market.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#56:2> Wang Canada has just announced Open/image for Netware, which

integrates docu <l> ment image processing into Novell's Netware 386 network

operating system, and Open/image-Windows 3.0, a new release of its image pro

<l> cessing software for 286, 386 and 486-based PCs. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#57:2> A major retailer in Toronto has chosen Wang to supply hard <l>

ware and software, said McIn <l> tyre, <quote> " and that was a significant

win for us.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#58:2> All our competitors were in there." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#59:2> The company has established an imaging centre in Winnipeg, in

conjunction with the govern <l> ment of Manitoba, and is developing a

document pro <l> cessing package called Upward, which will incorporate

Windows 3.0.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#60:2> Users will be able to create documents, <quote> " heaven forbid, on

one of the other products like WordPerfect," </quote> which can be

transferred back and forth.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#61:2> Up <l> ward will be available within the next couple of months. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#65:3> Take one film producer, a stockbroker and a software package

developed by church-going computer wizards in New York and you have Canadian

Interlinear Technology Inc. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#66:3> If this sounds a little bizarre, so is the story of how this

Willowdale, Ont.-based company and its flagship product, MEDIS, came into

existence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#67:3> Founder of Canadian Interlinear Technology Angus Sullivan, an

Irish Canadian, used to be in the film business.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#68:3> Last July, on a visit to New York, Sullivan encountered a friend from

church who had the documentation to a new software package called MEDIS. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#69:3> <quote> " He said, 'This is some technology some friends of mine

and some people in the church have developed, and would you like to see what

you can do with it in Canada?' " </quote> recounted Sullivan.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#70:3> <quote> " I said, 'What do I know about computers?'
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#71:3> Basically I'm a script-schlepper." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#72:3> What Sullivan did was to take the manual back to Canada. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#X73:3> <quote> " I thought to myself, 'They tell me in New York that this

is hot, hot, hot but what do I know?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#X74:3> How can I find out?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#X75:3> How can I prove it?'" </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#76:3> He attempted to interest investors, including one who had backed

some of his films, but was told the same thing: go and see some people in the

business and talk to end-users.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#77:3> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#78:3> So Sullivan went to Boeing, Spar Aerospace, GE Aerospace and

Litton Systems.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#79:3> He knew he had hit upon something after he left the manual with one

of the technical experts at Litton, <quote> " because when I came back he was

caressing the manual.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#80:3> I thought he was about to have some weird perverse type of

relationship," </quote> Sullivan recalled. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#X81:3> <quote> " I thought, 'There must be something in this manual;' as an

Irishman I can judge passion rather well." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#82:3> MEDIS ( Modular Electronic Document Image System) is a document

image system with an open, client-server-based architecture that consists of

seven software modules designed to run on Unix platforms.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#83:3> It is compliant with the Computer-aided Acquisition and Support (

GALS) initiative specified as a require <l> ment by the U.S. Department of

Defense for future defence contracts, which is why Interlinear is initially

targeting the aerospace industry.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#84:3> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#85:3> Sullivan showed the product to a chief engineer for one of the

major aircraft manufacturers who, while impressed by MEDIS, was <quote> "

absolutely terrified of the technology because it's his responsibility to

bring his company into that kind of thing." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#86:3> Still cautious, <quote> " having been in the film business a long

time you get your hopes up a lot, and you get <w> 'em </w> smashed a lot,"

</quote> Sullivan contacted his cousin, Robert Angus German, founder of Geac

Computer, who pronounced MEDIS <quote> " awesome" </quote> and advised

Sullivan to recruit <quote> " some super-technotron" </quote> to sell the

software. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#87:3> On the strength of this another cousin, Clive Sullivan, quit his

job as a stockbroker at Hector Chisholm & Co. in Toronto to sell the MEDIS

package and finance the start-up of Canadian Interlinear Technology, along

with " an old friend-of-the-family-type," W.K. Buckley Ltd. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#88:3> The company was incorporated on Feb. 1 this year and the

Sullivans have exclusive Canadian rights to the MEDIS technology as well as

an option on 10 per cent of the American company, Interlinear Technology.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#89:3> The main problem, ( Angus) Sullivan admits, is the long lead time

between starting up a business and selling your first unit, <quote> " which

is a long way down the line; so, basically, this is not the type of

investment that brokers would advise." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-033#90:3> Still, it helps to have relatives in the right places.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#91:3> And Sullivan has a lot of them.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#92:3> <quote> " When the Irish Catholics got to Canada centuries ago they

were like rabbits in carrot heaven, so they just went through the place and

ate everything and reproduced randomly all over.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-033#93:3> I've got cousins from coast to coast." </quote> </p> </I>
