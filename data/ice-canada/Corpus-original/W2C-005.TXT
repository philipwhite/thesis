<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#1:1> <h> Key Meech barrier looks to be cleared </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#2:1> One of the key stumbling blocks to ending the constitutional

crisis appears to have been cleared. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#3:1> Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the 10 provincial premiers have

tentatively agreed on a sweeping formula that could eventually lead to an

elected Senate. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#4:1> Jim Horsman, Alberta's Intergovernmental Affairs minister, said

there is a proposal for Senate reform that has gained the approval of all the

first ministers. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#5:1> The Senate reform package calls for a special commission, made up

of three representatives from the provinces and three from the federal

government, that would study and make recommendations on changes to the

Senate.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#6:1> The commission would be instructed to consider an elected Senate as

the best option. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#7:1> The new proposal, which appears to have the support of all 11

first ministers, would replace the original Meech Lake Accord proposal that

called for unanimous approval from Ottawa and the provinces for Senate

reform. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#8:1> If there is no agreement on how to change the Senate in the next

several years - the timing appears to be still under discussion - the Senate

would be changed automatically.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#9:1> The Western provinces and Newfoundland would get 10 senators instead

of six.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#10:1> Prince Edward Island would get one more senator for a total of five.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#11:1> Ontario and Quebec would each keep their 24 senators. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#12:1> The senators would continue to be appointed, but under the Meech

Lake formula, which requires Senators for each province be appointed by the

Prime Minister from a list of nominees from the province. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#13:1> The country's first ministers also dealt with other aspects of a

multi-part proposal by the federal government that calls for the dissenting

provinces to accept Meech Lake by the June 23 deadline.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#14:1> After Meech is approved, the proposal would see the concerns of those

opposed to Meech Lake addressed later. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#15:1> The federal proposals found support from New Brunswick's Frank

McKenna, who said his legislature can now pass the constitutional accord

providing there is some clarification on the timing of the federal

government's package of proposals. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#16:1> Meech Lake, which meets Quebec's conditions for signing the

constitution, calls for unanimous support from all the provinces in changing

major institutions such as the Senate. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#17:2> <h> GM threatens jobs, auto union says </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#18:2> Automaker General Motors of Canada Ltd. has warned 2,500 trim

plant workers in Windsor, Ont., their jobs could be lost if they don't accept

concessions, the Canadian Auto Workers Union says. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#19:2> An official of CAW Local 1973 says the concessions include

demands for productivity improvements that would eliminate 133 jobs at the

plant. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#20:2> GM Canada spokesman Nick Hall said 133 jobs " could very well be

lost" under GM's contract proposals but refused to say if the plant's future

hinges on approval of the concessions package. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#21:2> He did stress the plant suffers from poor productivity, noting it

is the only GM parts operation in Canada vulnerable to outside suppliers with

higher productivity.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#22:2> " We've got to be competitive, and if you aren't, you lose work," he

said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#23:2> The plant, which produces door and seat trim in cloth and leather

and plastic panels for door interiors, could continue to lose business "

until you've got nothing left," Hall said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#24:2> Jim Morand, trim shop committee chairman at CAW Local 1973, said

the GM plant has just lost its Buick LeSabre seat business to a Japanese-U.S.

joint-venture supplier in Mexico.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#25:2> He noted the union agreed to concessions in its last set of

negotiations in 1987 to win the LeSabre contract. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#26:2> Morand said the union may also lose a contract for the luxury

Buick Park Avenue car.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#27:2> " That's the axe they've got over our head." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#28:2> According to Morand, GM is seeking 14 concessions to make the

Windsor trim plant competitive.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#29:2> He said 1,500 trim plant workers voted May 27 to reject GM's initial

proposals, which included eliminating material handlers, consolidating jobs

classifications, ending five-minute wash-up periods and other changes

intended to boost productivity.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#30:2> GM's national contract expires Sept. 14. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#31:2> The trim plant has been hailed by GM as a Canadian success story

because of its synchronous manufacturing and just-in-time delivery

operations. </p> </I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#33:3> Montreal-based Steinberg Inc. yesterday confirmed industry

speculation that it has placed its Ontario Miracle Food Mart division on the

block. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#34:3> The food retailer and real estate company, which was bought by

Socanav Inc. last September for &dollar;1.3 billion, said the divestiture is

part of its plan to re-evaluate assets. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#35:3> Steinberg has retained Merrill Lynch Capital Markets as financial

adviser and agent for the sale. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#36:4> <h> BIG THREE SALES PLUMMET: No layoffs forecast despite slump in May

</h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#37:4> The Big Three <w> automakers' </w> Canadian car and truck sales

dropped sharply again last month as foreign-based manufacturers continue to

<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#39:4> But so far none of the Big Three in Canada is predicting imminent

temporary production halts or layoffs such as the ones that hit the industry

last winter. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#40:4> " With continued high interest rates, we anticipated a further

softening of the automobile market," said Bill Atkinson, General Motors of

Canada Ltd.'s vice-president of marketing. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#41:4> GM spokesman Barry Kuntz added that it is <quote> " too early to

tell" </quote> whether production halts will be necessary in the coming

months.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#42:4> He said the big shutdowns earlier this year have kept inventories in

line. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#43:4> Chrysler Canada Ltd. spokesman Othmar Stein said high interest

rates and the softening economy are spooking car buyers.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#44:4> " Canadians are getting nervous, and they're hedging their bets."

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#45:4> In May, Asian- and European-based automakers as a group

experienced a strong rise in Canadian sales.

<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#73:8> <h> MEECH CRISIS COSTLY, WILSON SAYS: Provinces, particularly

Newfoundland, see borrowing charges rise </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#74:8> The Meech Lake constitutional crisis is costing provincial

governments, particularly Newfoundland, a great deal of money in borrowing

costs, Finance Minister Michael Wilson said yesterday </p> .

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#75:8> Wilson read to the House of Commons Finance Committee a chart

that shows spreads between 30-year government bonds and comparable U.S.

government treasury bonds have widened considerably in the past six months.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#76:8> Government of Canada long bonds, for example, had a spread of 35

basis points over U.S. long bonds at the end of 1989.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#77:8> Today, that spread is 55 basis points, Wilson said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#78:8> For provinces with a shakier credit rating, such as Newfoundland,

the widening trend is more severe.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#79:8> Newfoundland 30-year bonds were trading 85 basis points above U.S.

bonds in December and the spread has widened to 130 points in recent weeks.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#80:8> " Clearly, there is something in the marketplace that is causing

these spreads to widen against comparable securities.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#81:8> And one of those things, I believe, is the concern, the uncertainty

surrounding Meech Lake.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#82:8> The result is any borrower in the United States market today will

have to pay more." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#83:8> Recently, the Newfoundland government tried to float a bond issue

in the U.S. with a spread of 110 basis points over U.S. bonds.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#84:8> The provincial government ended up issuing the bonds at a spread of

120 basis points, Wilson said.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#85:8> The issue subsequently traded in the 135-140-basis-point range

against comparable U.S. treasuries. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#86:8> " And that has cost Newfoundland taxpayers a meaningful amount of

money over the next 30 years," he added. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#87:8> Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells is considered to be the

staunchest opponent of the Meech Lake Accord, a constitutional amendment

designed to bring Quebec into the constitutional fold. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#88:8> Spreads of other provinces against U.S. bonds have also widened

considerably in the past six months - Quebec and Saskatchewan by about 40

basis points and Ontario by 20 points. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#89:8> Wilson refused to comment on what will happen to interest rates

in Canada if the provinces fail to reach an agreement on ratification of the

Meech Lake Accord.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#90:8> The accord needs the consent of all 10 premiers to be ratfied by its

deadline of June 23.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#91:8> The premiers have been meeting in Ottawa to try to hammer out their

differences before the deadline. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#92:8> Wilson said he has also had anecdotal evidence of companies

saying they will not proceed with investment decisions in Canada until the

Meech Lake crisis is sorted out </p> . </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#93:9> <h> Bad news on pricing gas producers </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#94:9> Canadian gas producers have received bad news concerning the

price of natural gas they want to sell to California this summer. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#95:9> Alberta & Southern Gas Co. Ltd., marketer for a pool of 190

Canadian gas producers, yesterday proposed a cut in the price it pays

suppliers for most gas shipped to California this summer. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#96:9> A new, two-tier price scheme proposed by A & S will mean the gas

marketer will pay its suppliers roughly 10% less for gas shipped during the

coming contract year, says Jerry McLeod, executive vice-president of Pacific

Gas and Electric Co., A & S's parent and principal customer. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#97:9> A & S expects its annual revenue from Alberta gas exports to fall

to &dollar;760 million from &dollar;800 million, the company's executive

vice-president, Donald Morland, told reporters. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#98:9> For many years, California has been the most lucrative export

market for Western Canadian natural gas.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#99:9> But market forces unleashed by the continent-wide gas industry

deregulation have led to intense competition with U.S. gas suppliers and with

other fuels, particular fuel oil. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-005#100:9> McLeod said A & S is lowering the prices of some of the gas

offered in its new gas purchase contract because the California Public

Utilities Commission is pressing A & S's gas and electrical utility parent to

<quote> " respond to lower gas prices available in Canada." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-005#101:9> Under its agreement with the California utilities commission, PG & E

must take steps to obtain the cheapest possible gas supply for California

consumers or risk financial penalties, he said. </p> </I>
