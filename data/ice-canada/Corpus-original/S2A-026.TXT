<I>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#1:1> They <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> know that <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#2:1> So <,> that's why <,> if you look at for example us as E S L teachers

<,> in our specialty <,> we have <}> <-> a </-> uh <=> an </=> </}> extra <,>

complication to our first year of teaching in the sense of that we've worked

with <,> the communicative approach <,> okay which is seen as something <}>

<-> which <,> you </-> <=> which is </=> </}> a very open approach
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#3:1> It's something very uhm
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#4:1> You deal with the interests of the student
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#5:1> You learn with <}> <-> the </-> uh <,,> ah <=> the </=> </}> emotions

even
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#6:1> <}> <-> You deal with </-> <=> It's a </=> </}> very personal kind of

thing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#7:1> It's a personality kind of thing <,> okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#8:1> And to be able to obtain the communicative approach <,> you have to

break through <,> you have to get to know the students <,> on a real level

<,> okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#9:1> But <,> in order for them to trust you and to let them <}> <-> know

</-> <=> show </=> </}> you who they are as a person <,> <}> <-> you have to

gain </-> <=> you have to </=> </}> <}> <-> <.> es </.> to </-> <=> establish

</=> </}> that base of trust <,> okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#10:1> You have to establish that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#11:1> And I knew this from traditional teaching that you establish that

trust <,> and then <}> <-> the more </-> <,> <=> as time goes on </=> </}>

<,> then <,> you know you can start <,,> <}> <-> <.> de </.> </-> <=> doing

</=> </}> new things and doing interesting things
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#12:1> So <,> for the first teaching class for the first class I believe in

a very <,> straight <,> traditional <,> ah class <,> in which <,,> the

students <,> learn vocabulary <,,> okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#13:1> And you say <,> next class we'll have a test <,> on all of these

words <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#14:1> So they'll have to study <,,> okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#15:1> What does that mean <,> when you give them a test on vocabulary <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#16:1> It means they're <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> come home

<,> and <?> then </?> have to study English
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#17:1> And mom and dad are <}> <-gonna  </-> <+> going to </+> </}> say what

are they studying
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#18:1> Vocabulary
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#19:1> Ah <,> <&> laughter </&>

<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#103:1:A> You know the first year that I was teaching <,> uh the first day

<,> the first group I had was a strong group <,> okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#104:1:A> This group had a eighty percent average <,> since secondary one

and they were always together
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#105:1:A> And I had them in secondary five <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#106:1:A> But I didn't <,> know that okay

<,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#110:1:A> And <,> I came in and you know and <,,> <&> makes a clapping noise

</&> this and you know my heart's jumping
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#111:1:A> And uh my activity was a Flight activity
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#112:1:A> I don't know if you're <,> familiar with Flight
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#113:1:A> It's a communicative approach <,> book

these little numbers and then you give the kids the numbers and then the kids

<,> take the numbers and they go into groups <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#117:1:A> And it's about key words and they have to take the groups and then

they come in front of the class and
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#118:1:A> It sounds wonderful <O> awkward laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#119:1:A> <?> And I was with </?> a strong group <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#120:1:A> And uh <,> they walked in and the bell rang

drrrrr-ring </O> <&> voices the noise of a school buzzer </&>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#122:1:A> And he walks in and <?> I </?> go hey hey don't be late hey

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-026#128:1:A> <unclear> three or four words </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#129:1:A> And <}> <-> then they </-> <,> <=> then they </=> </}> did the

group thing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#130:1:A> <?> And then </?> it was like free-for-all <,> you know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#131:1:A> It <.> did </.> you know because <}> <-> they don't </-> <,> <=>

they don't </=> </}> understand the procedures of the class <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#132:1:A> It's a complicated thing teaching <,> you know going into groups

<}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> you know it's a lot of ah <,> class

management <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#133:1:A> So <,,> uh my first day of teaching was like that <,,> you know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#134:1:A> And <}> <-> I didn't have the <.> m </.> </-> <=> I didn't have

the method </=> </}> so I photocopied everything

<}> <-> all the </-> <,> <=> all the </=> </}> work that they had
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#136:1:A> Then my next group <,> was a very very very very weak group <,>

okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#137:1:A> So I thought it went well for my first class <,,> you know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#138:1:A> Sure <}> <-> they they </-> <,> you know <=> it was free-for-all

<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#142:1:A> They were nice basically <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#143:1:A> But then I went into a tough group <,> okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#144:1:A> And this group <O> laugh starts </O> okay in secondary <O> laugh

</+> </}> </?> establish trust <,> okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#199:1:A> And what you want to work with is what students know already <,>

okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#200:1:A> So uhhh <,> when you start teaching in the first few days <,> <}>

<-> whatchoo </-> <+> what you </+> </}> <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+>

start that book <,> </=> you know <-> before you </-> </}> <,> think about

how you want to teach
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#205:1:A> Your teaching <&> pronounced 'steaching' </&> strategy <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#206:1:A> Cos that's the most important thing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#207:1:A> How you want to teach
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#208:1:A> And think about it hard
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#209:1:A> Don't trust <,,> you know all this stuff around you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#210:1:A> You have to find out what are you going to do here <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#211:1:A> On my first day <}> <-> I </-> <,> <=> I </=> </}> think I wrote

down everything I was going to say <,> okay
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#212:1:A> Like <,> <}> <-> my </-> <=> my </=> </}> lesson plan was I think

five pages long <,> you know

goes on

<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#215:1:A> <?> And </?> there's nothing wrong with that

with sitting down and really thinking about it <,,> you know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-026#217:1:A> But uh <,,> I think <}> <-> it's it's </-> <,> <=> to me </=> </}>

what I like about the idea of not having any confrontation <,> at the

beginning is <,> that's what helps you <}> <-> to </-> uh <,,> <=> to </=>

</}> establish a relationship <,> based on <,> learning <,> and not based on

a power trip
