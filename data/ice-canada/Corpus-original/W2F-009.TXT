<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#1:1> <h> Babies from Cabbages </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#2:1> REBECCA RAGLON

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-009#3:1> AFTER NINE MONTHS of no smoking, no drinking, and no medication

stronger than vitamins, not even aspirin; after nine months of weighing and

measuring and testing, of charts, checkups, and ultrasound; after nine months

of this routine, it's easy to forget that babies really do come from

cabbages, or from hollow logs, or from behind storkstones.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#4:1> It's easy to for <l> get that for centuries they've been pulled out of

wells, or have been found floating down rivers in little reed baskets, or

sway <l> ing in the branches of blossoming fruit trees.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#5:1> Babies have even been suckled by wolves, fed by eagles, and teased by

the wood-folk when they've been bad.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#6:1> In the flurry of buying bright plastic mobiles and playpens, and of

scraping and saving and planning for the future, it's easy to forget the

important things, like putting the babies out — in the furrows of plowed

fields, under the willows, or on the sand where the waves beat.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#7:1> It's so easy to forget what really makes babies happy and strong and

wise. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-009#8:1> All that year in graduate school I grew pregnant under the shocked

and disapproving eyes of my professors.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#9:1> It was no dis <l> creet little bundle, either; I was huge.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#10:1> The baby inside me hated the morning classes and kicked and kicked

and kicked as we sat solemnly around the seminar table deconstructing poems

and quoting the critics.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#11:1> We talked " strategies" and " margins" and " reader-response."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#12:1> All my professors were men, two were bachelors, and that year we

spent a semester on T.S. Eliot's <quote> " dark embryos," </quote> his term

for his poems.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#13:1> Eliot muscling in on women's work that way seemed cheeky, and I hated

the lines <quote> " April is the cruelest month, breeding / Lilacs out of the

dead land" </quote> more than any other in English poetry.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#14:1> What is dead land anyway, and how can dead land breed lilacs?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#15:1> Questions like that are best left unasked in graduate school. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-009#16:1> As my belly grew and I started to wear clothes with huge collars

and big bows ( to draw the eye away from the belly, sup <l> posedly), I began

to get the impression that many people around, professors and students alike,

felt that my condition was rather distasteful, a discredit to the department,

not quite <it> scholarly </it> .
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#17:1> Scholars, like artists, should be wedded to their work and devoted to

ideas; above all, they should prefer books to human beings.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#18:1> On the other hand, perhaps it was all in my imagination.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#19:1> When you're pregnant you tend to get keyed up; it is suddenly obvious

that you are no longer in control of your life.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#20:1> The sight of poor Tony there in bed beside me every morning, for

example, never failed to make me feel ill.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#21:1> I don't think I ever cried more in my life, and yet I was so happy

most of the time.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#22:1> Sometimes I felt as if I was looking at the world through a

magnifying glass, everything suddenly seemed so huge and radiant. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-009#23:1> We lived in a very old town.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#24:1> They were always digging up shards of glass and old nails, and in

piles of rubble archaeolo <l> gists could discern old forts, log cabins, and

cemeteries.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#25:1> Nothing much had ever really happened in our town, though, so the

historic spots were rather dull; on this spot, Lord So-and-So picked his

teeth two hundred years ago, that sort of thing.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#26:1> Parts of the town were pretty, especially the part down by the lake

where the large houses and trees were, but we lived far, far from the lake on

a noisy, busy road where the rent was cheap.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#27:1> Next to us lived a family of louts — they liked to sit out on their

porch steps and fight and smash bottles.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#28:1> Across the street were Jimmy and Hilda.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#29:1> They spent all their time peeking through their ancient yellow

curtains, keeping tabs on everyone in the neighbourhood.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#30:1> On the corner was a little store; the woman who ran it didn't have

enough money to keep it stocked and the shelves were always empty.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#31:1> We called it " The Empty Store."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#32:1> No one wanted to shop there anyway because the place smelled like cat

piss and no one had the heart to tell her. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-009#33:1> One night in late fall when the baby was just beginning to show,

we pulled into a gas station, and as Tony jumped out to pump gas ( I was now

afraid to breathe fumes, clean the cat lit <l> ter, or work in front of a

computer screen among dozens of other things), I sat and watched as a yellow

and black spider wove an enormous web between the high-octane pump and the

paper-towel dispenser.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#34:1> A few months earlier and I wouldn't have noticed the spider; I

wouldn't have been inter <l> ested.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#35:1> Now all life interested me in a painful sort of way.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#36:1> The way things grew and struggled and died seemed terrible, and at

the same time full of remarkable beauty.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#37:1> Earthworms, slugs, ants, moths, cats, dogs, bats, were all the most

astonishing things.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#38:1> What was a poem compared to an earwig?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#39:1> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-009#40:1> The spider was having difficulty with the smooth sides of the

towel dispenser, but finally anchored her net and went on with her work.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#41:1> Her web was intricate and so beautiful; the whole complex thing

supported by four fine threads.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#42:1> Then, on the other side of the gas island, an old rusty Malibu pulled

up with two people inside.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#43:1> They weren't any particular kind of people, but under the fluorescent

lights and in their old gas guzzler they looked weird, like they had landed

from another planet.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#44:1> I watched them as they piled out of their car, afraid someone might

knock the web down.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#45:1> I kept thinking of all that effort, for what?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#46:1> For what?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#47:1> What's wrong with us?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#48:1> As we pulled away into the dark I started to cry, and then caught my

<l> self, crying over a spider and a rusted Malibu.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#49:1> Somehow it didn't seem absurd.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#50:1> I cried a lot that year. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-009#51:1> Sometimes I couldn't sleep at night and I would get up and go out

and start walking through our neighbourhood.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#52:1> Nor <l> mally winter is torture for me, but all that winter I was

warm and would walk around with my coat unbuttoned and without any mittens.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#53:1> When the snow came, it came in huge soft flakes, laying down bright

white blankets over each shabby house, gently covering the garbage cans, the

old cars, and the washing machines abandoned in the back yards.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#54:1> Icicles formed on the eaves, growing longer by day and shimmering in

the moonlight like the fangs of a mythical animal.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#55:1> I liked passing the lighted windows in the dark, peering through

half-drawn curtains, catching glimpses of people's lives inside: an old man

on an old fashioned maroon plush sofa, reading a newspaper, three people

sitting around a table lit by candle light, a woman watching television over

the top of her glasses and knitting, and outside in the dark, the baby and me

and a million snow <l> flakes gliding by unobserved. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-009#56:1> In the morning I'd thrust my feet into a pair of moccasins ( it

was getting harder and harder to put on my shoes) and go out on the back

porch where the bird feeder was.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#57:1> Usually there was a little flock of sparrows and purple finches

waiting like strange fruit in the bare branches of the ash tree and they'd

start twittering and fluttering around as I pulled on the clothes line to

reel in the feeder and fill it with seeds. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-009#58:1> On weekends Tony and I drove into the country to a park and went

skiing down a winding trail, going through the scrub trees, then out across a

lake, and back up into a winter woods of snow-covered pine trees.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#59:1> I was terrified I would fall, and I al <l> ways did fall, again and

again, but everything was all right with drifts of snow cushioning me and

Tony there to help me up again.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#60:1> We stopped in a small sunny field where pieces of brown grass poked

up through the snow and an old grey barn slowly slumped back into the ground.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#61:1> On bright sunny days, with the snow and blue sky sparkling, we'd sit

on a log, drink rose hip tea, and watch the chickadees. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-009#62:1> " We won't be able to go skiing after this year," I told Tony,

but he scoffed.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#63:1> Tony was an optimist and he said that next year he'd ski with the

baby on his back, and the year after that he'd get a dog and a dog sled, and

the year after that, a little pair of skis.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#64:1> I didn't like it when he talked like that.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#65:1> I felt it was tempting fate. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-009#66:1> For the first time in my life, I loved going grocery shopping.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#67:1> I loved pushing my cart through the aisles of the store, rubbing

shoulders with everyone, watching the kids riding in the carts and the

Portuguese women expertly prodding the produce and helping themselves to the

grapes.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#68:1> I liked piling my cart full; for once I could eat as much as I wanted

and feel virtuous about it.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#69:1> I was always hungry and I liked all kinds of food.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#70:1> Good practical food like bread and pasta and peanut butter, but also

all sorts of other things: cartons of yogurt, and all types of cheese,

blue-veined, yellow, white, pungent, creamy and soft, and hard, cheeses

spiced, herbed, and smoked, Italian Par <l> mesan, French Brie, and English

Cheddar.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#71:1> There were olives, green, black, and stuffed with pimentos and

pickled beets, pickled onions, and Polish dills.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#72:1> I could spend hours admiring the fruits and vegetables, and the men

and women who worked with them, piling them into artistic red, green, orange,

and purple pyramids, and spraying them down with hoses, fretting over the

people who pawed and squeezed, looking for the best.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#73:1> I never squeezed, not much, but took a little of every <l> thing —

oranges, bananas, avocados, kale, purple cabbage, carrots, cauliflower,

apples and pomegranates.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#74:1> Tony, always the big eater, couldn't keep up with me — squash,

celery, yams, parsley, eggplant, pears. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-009#75:1> Sometimes in the middle of the night I'd wake up sweat <l> ing,

afraid.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#76:1> I'd turn the light on and start looking through the baby books.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#77:1> We had two: the " good" baby book, which seemed to be based on the

assumption that everything — conception, labour, birth — would be all right,

and the " bad" baby book, which mentioned every possible type of misfortune.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#78:1> I bounced back and forth between them, alternately believing that

every <l> thing would be all right, and convinced that nothing would work

out.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#79:1> More and more panic seemed to win out, but for some reason I couldn't

tell Tony, or anyone, about my fears.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#80:1> I lived with them, endured them, wandered barefoot in the kitchen at

2 a.m. to heat up milk, then plunked down in front of the television to watch "

Magnum, P.I." reruns, the cat pur <l> ring on what remained of my lap. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-009#81:1> One day I took a large sheet of paper and a pencil and with the

help of the two baby books, made a list.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#82:1> 2 undershirts
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#83:1> 1 crib and mattress
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#84:1> 1 playpen ( ? )
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#85:1> 2 rattles
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#86:1> 6 sleepers
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#87:1> 2 towels
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#88:1> 1 wash tub
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#89:1> 1 bar baby soap
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#90:1> 1 soother ( ? )
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#91:1> 1 teddy bear
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#92:1> crib sheets
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#93:1> bumper pads
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#94:1> booties
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#95:1> 6 receiving blankets
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#96:1> " What are receiving blankets?"
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#97:1> I asked Tony as I taped the list to the refrigerator.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#98:1> " The baby book says we need six of them.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#99:1> And what about a soother?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#100:1> You think it's a good idea or not?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-009#101:1> In March all the snow melted, leaving behind dog droppings on

brown grass.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#102:1> People who hadn't been outdoors in months suddenly appeared,

shuffling down the street in their bedroom slippers.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#103:1> Tony and I started going to our pre-natal classes and with a dozen

other couples learned the facts of life.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#104:1> As we lay stretched out on our backs on the floor, practising our

breath <l> ing, I felt like I was in a field of watermelons — I <it> was

</it> a watermelon — and the men crouched there all looked sheepish and

guilty, as if they were trying to steal something. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-009#105:1> I started seeing the doctor once every two weeks, then once a

week. </I> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#X106:1> My urine was tested, I was weighed, and then, flat on my back, the

doctor took her tape measure and measured my belly.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#X107:1> " Looks like it will be a good-sized baby," she said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-009#X108:1> " Ah, there's the head." </p> </X>
