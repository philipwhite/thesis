<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#1:1> <h> Ontario looking to the future in advanced composite materials </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#2:1> Super-strong golf clubs, artificial joints and ceramic engine

parts appear to have little in common.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#3:1> But all are made using space-age materials. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#4:1> These advanced materials are composites, combinations of materials

offering extreme strength and lightness.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#5:1> They are already being used in manufacturing, medicine, communications

and aerospace industries.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#6:1> And the field is becoming increasingly competitive as countries such

as Japan pour billions of dollars into research. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#7:1> <h> CENTRES OF EXCELLENCE </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#8:1> To help Canada stay in the race, the Ontario government's

nonprofit Ontario Centre for Materials Research - biggest of seven centres of

excellence set up by the Premier's Council - will receive &dollar;43 million

in provincial grants over five years. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#9:1> The centre manages and promotes long-term research in advanced

materials at the University of Waterloo, Hamilton's McMaster University,

University of Western Ontario in London, Queen's University in Kingston and

University of Toronto. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#10:1> The two biggest applications for composites are military

equipment and sporting goods, says Craig Simpson, of Ontario Hydro's research

division. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#11:1> Simpson spoke at the annual meeting of the Ontario Centre for

Materials Research ( OCMR) this week in Toronto and used a &dollar;150

golf-club shaft as a pointer during his presentation. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#12:1> Simpson said the composite club was developed in Japan, where

most high-tech sports equipment originates.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#13:1> With the help of provincial funding and OCMR, a variety of products

incorporating composites will one day be made in Ontario, he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#14:1> The centre for materials research helps to fund world-class

research projects and ensures that technological advances and information on

new materials flows into Canadian industry.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#15:1> When industry develops what the research community wants, funds also

flow into corporate coffers. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#16:1> For example, Toronto-based Electrofuel Manufacturing Co. Ltd.

supplied two pieces of equipment for McMaster's ceramics research. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#17:1> Electrofuel President Sankar Das Gupta said a high-temperature,

high-pressure furnace to measure the expansion and contraction of ceramics

was developed by the university and his company. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#18:1> The furnace, which operates at 2,000 C - steel melts at about

1,400 C - costs &dollar;55,000. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#19:1> Electrofuel also designed and built a &dollar;150,000 vacuum hot

press to manufacture ceramics parts. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#20:1> Both pieces of equipment are owned by the centre for materials

research, but McMaster will have first crack at acquiring them at fair market

value when the centre's funding agreement with the government is completed.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#21:1> Getting the equipment installed and working has resulted in

orders from research and development laboratories in other countries, Das

Gupta said.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#22:1> He expects the six-year-old company's revenues to double to &dollar;4

million in 1990. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#23:1> Other industry members include heavyweights such as Alcan

Aluminium Ltd., Imperial Oil Ltd. and Dofasco Inc., as well as smaller firms

such as Ultra High Vacuum Instruments Ltd. in Burlington, <}> <-> Ont. </->

<+> Ontario </+> </}> , and Brampton's Colortech Inc. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#24:1> Most OCMR initial funding went to buy equipment necessary to

carry out materials research.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#25:1> More than &dollar;1.2 million went to particle beam studies at

Western.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#26:1> McMaster's molecular beam epitaxy unit, which makes new materials for

chips used in optical communications systems, cost &dollar;1.2 million. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#27:1> The centre also funds university scientists working in:

biomaterials, polymers and composites; components handling optical and

electronic communications signals; metals and ceramics; the study of surfaces

and interfaces. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#28:1> <h> COAGULATION RATES </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#29:1> Baxter Healthcare Corp. of Deerfield, <}> <-> Ill. </-> <+>

Illinois </+> </}> , through its Mississauga-based Canadian subsidiary, is

partially funding two OCMR-supported scientists working in biomedical

materials at McMaster and <}> <-> U of T </-> <+> University of Toronto </+>

</}> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#30:1> One researcher is studying changes in blood coagulation rates

when it comes in contact with materials in kidney dialysis machines and other

equipment.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#31:1> The other researcher is trying to develop a coating to protect

transplanted pancreatic cells from being rejected. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#32:1> Almost &dollar;10 million was allocated to more than 30 OCMR

projects in the year ended March 31, 1989. </p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#33:2> <h> Brokers offer more market information </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#34:2> Discount brokers are offering clients a variety of electronic

market-quote systems to get more information into <w> investors' </w> hands -

and more commissions into <w> brokers' </w> pockets. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#35:2> Clients at Toronto-based Marathon Brokerage can choose from

market-information systems developed by Stratford Software Corp. of

Vancouver, Toronto-based International Hay-Info Communications Inc. or Bell

Canada's Alex home shopping service. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#36:2> Alex, which has been operating in Montreal for more than a year,

will be available in the Toronto area starting next Monday. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#37:2> Stratford and Hav-Info provide real-time quotes.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#38:2> Alex offers real-time quotes from the Montreal and Toronto stock

exchanges and a 15-minute delay on the Vancouver exchange. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#39:2> <h> PHONE ACCESS </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#40:2> Toronto Dominion Green Line Investor Services Inc. has its own

real-time quote service, which is accessible by touch-tone phone, but it also

offers Alex. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#41:2> Discounters say do-it-yourself quotes and market information are

ideal for people who manage their own investments, do their own research and

analysis, and only use a broker to trade securities. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#42:2> " They take control of their own portfolios and look to us for

information, not for advice or recommendations," Marathon President Paul

Bates said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#43:2> He believes giving clients more information means they will trade

more often, generating more commission fees. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#44:2> Stratford's information system, called Suzy, has more

market-related features than the others, but it doesn't cover U.S. exchanges.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#45:2> The company started shipping the product this week. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#46:2> Suzy offers quotes from four Canadian exchanges, stock indices,

share price changes and volumes, a breakdown of trades on each company,

portfolio updates, and news stories and press releases carried by the Globe &

Mail's InfoGlobe service and StockWatch, a Vancouver publication.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#47:2> It can compile lists of the most active stocks or generate daily or

weekly stock-price graphs. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#48:2> Bates said Marathon is working with Stratford to develop features

that will enable clients to access their own accounts and check the balance

and margin available, or get information on Marathon's services. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#49:2> Suzy's electronic mail feature also allows users to send memos or

files.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#50:2> Stratford is setting up information networks on various subjects.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#51:2> Already available is small business accounting, run by software

consultant Richard Morochove, and entrepreneurship, run by Rick Spence,

editor of Small Business magazine. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#52:2> Hav-Info doesn't yet provide news items or graphics, but its

quotes service is more extensive, covering not only four Canadian exchanges

but Trans Canada options, Toronto's over-the-counter stocks, New York and

American stock exchanges, and the Dow Jones industrial average. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#53:2> <h> SHOP-AT-HOME SERVICE </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#54:2> Alex carries quotes from the three exchanges, but is working with

the exchanges and other market-quote service firms to beef up its financial

offerings.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#55:2> It carries a host of other information, including a shop-at-home

service. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#56:2> The three companies charge about the same for quote services, but

hardware and software requirements differ. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#57:2> The basic fee for Suzy is 20 cents a minute, plus on-line charges

or tapping into the news databases and using other features.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#58:2> Discounts are offered after market hours.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#59:2> <}> <-> Have-Info </-> <+> Hav-Info </+> </}> charges 29 cents a

minute and Alex 25 cents a minute for quotes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#60:2> Suzy is a software disk that costs &dollar;29.95.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#61:2> To use it you need an IBM or IBM-compatible personal computer with at

least 384K of ram memory and a modem.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#62:2> No other software is required. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#63:2> Hav-Info's system also runs on IBM or IBM compatible PCs with

modems.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#64:2> But Marathon clients who don't have a computer can buy a Hav-Info

terminal with built-in modem for &dollar;599, a &dollar;200 discount from the

regular price.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#65:2> Communications software allowing the unit to send and receive data is

free. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#66:2> An IBM or Macintosh PC with modem, and free software provided by

Bell, will pick up Alex.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#67:2> Those without computers need a special terminal, which plugs into a

phone jack and rents for &dollar;7.95 a month.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#68:2> The first two months are free. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#69:2> Green Line's direct quote service is free to clients who do at

one trade a month through the discounter.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#70:2> Non-traders get 25 free quotes a month, before a &dollar;0.25-a-quote

charge kicks in. </p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#71:3> <h> Bright future forecast for document imaging </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#72:3> Document imaging is the latest weapon in the war against paper

burden.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#73:3> These systems scan letters, invoices and legal documents and store

them in picture form on computer disk. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#74:3> The process is intended to speed up paper flow through large

organizations, said Elliot Katz, a product manager with Wang Canada Ltd. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#75:3> Banks, insurance companies and government agencies are among the

first to get into document imaging. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#76:3> " There's massive savings available," said Paul Renaud, director

of technology for SHL Systemhouse Inc. of Ottawa. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#77:3> The snag is that document systems are expensive - &dollar;15,000

to &dollar;20,000 a workstation - because pictures require a lot of hardware.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#78:3> They also take up a lot of space on disk and demand high-powered

microprocessors. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#79:3> With scanners to read documents, optical disk storage and a few

high-resolution monitors, a typical entry-level network costs about

&dollar;650,000.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#80:3> Large systems can add robot-controlled libraries of optical disks and

satellite communications links. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#81:3> The U.S.-based Association for Information & Image Management

estimates the market for image systems will be worth US&dollar;12.7 billion

by 1993, making it potentially one of the strongest segments of the computer

industry. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#82:3> The two biggest players are Wang, which has sold 20 of its

minicomputer-based systems in Canada, and Filenet Corp. of California, which

has sold five. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#83:3> Although suppliers are quick to compare imaging to earlier

computer stars, such as data processing in the 1970s or desktop publishing in

the 1980s, users haven't been as quick to lay down their cash. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#84:3> Systemhouse's Renaud said one reason could be the generic

one-system-for-all approach some suppliers have taken. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#85:3> <X> <quote> " There's a fair number of misconceptions about image

systems.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#X86:3> The first one is that there's a cookie-cutter or no-brain solution

for everyone." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#87:3> Although most large organizations will admit to having a problem

with paper, the solution must be tailored to specific bottlenecks in the

company and build from their computer system, as opposed to scanning

everything in the office, he added. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#88:3> Mutual Life Assurance Co. of Canada uses a Filenet system to

speed the processing of death claims. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#89:3> " It has improved our service in the department, reduced the

amount of paper and we no longer lose pieces of paper," said Ray Simonson, an

administrative services executive with the firm. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#90:3> But, he added, the system " is not really as useful as

information coded in a database." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#91:3> For example, a traditional database record system can track

customers by sex, age, or other characteristics, which can be easily

cross-referenced by computer. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#92:3> Documents stored in picture form can't be automatically broken

down into such categories. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#93:3> And organizations that deal with paper efficiently have a hard

time justifying the high cost of jumping to an electronic system. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#94:3> But technological improvements and the recent introduction of

low-cost systems for personal computers from large manufacturers such as Wang

and International Business Machines Corp. are likely to change that, Simonson

said. <X> <quote> " Now we're looking again." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#95:3> One firm hoping to jump in at the bottom end of the market is

software firm Imara Research Corp. of Toronto.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#96:3> Imara intends to ship a &dollar;400 imaging program that can be used

on relatively low-cost standard hardware.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#97:3> The program, which has yet to be named, will be available in June.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#98:3> Imara has already done joint marketing with IBM and software

giant Microsoft Corp., which are counting on new products to stimulate sales

of computers using Microsoft's new operating system, OS/2. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#99:3> " Imara's is one of the first imaging products built on standard

technology that can sit on anybody's machine without spending hundreds of

thousands of dollars," said David Boker, Microsoft Canada's corporate

accounts manager.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#100:3> <quote> <X> " There's certainly a strong feeling about the product

at Microsoft." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#101:3> Imara Chairman Stephen Sutherland projects sales of &dollar;1.5

million by February, 1991. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#102:3> Although Sutherland acknowledges the estimate is " really low,"

he's quick to compare his 15-employee firm's product to other leading

personal computer programs, such as Aldus Corp.'s Pagemaker, the breakthrough

desktop publishing program, and Wordperfect Corp.'s Wordperfect, the

longstanding word processor of choice in many companies. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#103:3> <quote> <X> " The fact that there are high-end systems

available, just legitimizes the need for the technology." </quote> </X> </p>

</I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-038#104:4> Indeed, most of the scientists working on the new technology say

that they have merely crossed the frontier of an exciting new concept.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#105:4> But Jacobson predicts that virtual-reality products will be

available to such commercial users as architects and engineers within five

years, while mass-market consumer entertainment products will be available

within a decade.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-038#106:4> But given the rate at which previous computer revolutions have

occurred, virtual reality could become a commonplace technology much sooner

than that. </p> </I>
