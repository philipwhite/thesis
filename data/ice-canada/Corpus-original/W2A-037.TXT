<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-037#3:1> <bold> Abstract </bold> - Algorithms which calculate the classical

one-metal predominance area or phase stability diagram are briefly reviewed.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#4:1> The <quote> " Constrained Chemical Potential Method" </quote> , which

has been used to calculate one-metal predominance area diagrams, is adapted

to calculate two-metal and higher order systems.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#5:1> The topologies of the resulting diagrams are analyzed and general

guidelines are proposed for constructing multi-metal predominance area

diagrams.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#6:1> Examples are presented for systems containing one metal, Fe-S-O,

Ca-C-O-S-H, Cu-S-O, Zn-S-O, Al-S-O; two metals, Al-Zn-S-O, Al-Si-C-O,

Cu-Fe-S-O ; and three metals, Al-Fe-Zn-S-O. </p> <X>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-037#12:1> The predominance area or phase stability diagram provides a

convenient means of assembling heterogeneous equilibria in various gaseous

atmospheres.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#13:1> For example, <}> <-> Fig. </-> <+> Figure </+> </}> 1 shows the

classical one-metal predominance area diagram for the Fe-S-O system where the

axes are log <sb> 10 </sb> <it> P </it> ( SO <sb> 2 </sb> ) and log <sb> 10

</sb> <it> P </it> ( O <sb> 2 </sb> ) .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#14:1> All the species are in their pure standard states and the diagram is

calculated from the standard Gibbs energies of formation of these species.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#15:1> Algorithms which calculate and plot this type of one-metal

predominance diagram are well documented in the literature <fnr> [ 1-19]

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-037#16:1> The diagram provides a researcher with a wealth of infor <l>

mation on the stability and reactivity of the iron-bearing species in oxygen

and sulphur atmospheres.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#17:1> Figure 1 shows the effect of temperature in the range 800 to 1000 K
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#18:1> The diagram shows which species coexist and which species react.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#19:1> For example, at 900 K the mixture of FeS-FeO-Fe <sb> 3 </sb> O <sb> 4

</sb> forms a stable invariant point.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#20:1> On the other hand, the mixture Fe-FeS <sb> 2 </sb> is unstable and

reacts to form FeS. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-037#21:1> The phases are assumed to have fixed stoichiometry.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#22:1> Vari <l> able compositions due to solution phases ( oxygen and sulfur

dissolved in iron) or non-stoichiometry ( Fe <sb> 1- <it> x </it> </sb> O)

are generally not taken into account.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#23:1> For those systems where there are non-stoichiometric compounds or

stable solution phases, the predominance area diagram is not the true phase

diagram but rather a map of the relative stabilities or " domains of pre <l>

dominance" of the one-component species. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-037#24:1> The predominance area diagram is not limited to one metal with

two elements.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#25:1> For example, <}> <-> Fig. </-> <+> Figure </+> </}> 2 shows a

Ca-based system at 1100, 1150 and 1200 K with four elements: C, O, S and H.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#26:1> The axes are log <sb> 10 </sb> <it> P </it> ( SO <sb> 2 </sb> ) and

log <sb> 10 </sb> <it> P </it> ( O <sb> 2 </sb> ) with the variables <it> P

</it> ( H <sb> 2 </sb> 0) and <it> P </it> ( CO) <sp> 2 </sp> / <it> P </it>

( CO <sb> 2 </sb> ) held constant.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#27:1> Each domain in <}> <-> Fig. </-> <+> Figure </+> </}> 2 contains one

Ca-bearing species. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-037#28:1> If the system contains two metals, for example Cu and Fe, the

result is a two-metal predominance area diagram ( <}> <-> Figs </-> <+>

Figures </+> </}> 7b to 7e).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#29:1> The chemical interactions become more complicated due to the

formation of multi-metal compounds of the type Cu <sb> 5 </sb> FeS <sb> 4

</sb> , Cu <sb> 2 </sb> O&dot;Fe <sb> 2 </sb> O <sb> 3 </sb> and CuO&dot;Fe

<sb> 2 </sb> O <sb> 3 </sb> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#30:1> Certain domains in the two-metal diagram do not obey the same rules

of construction as the one-metal diagram and so the complete diagram can not

be calculated in the same manner.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#31:1> The two-metal predominance area diagram is different because each

domain contains two species and the relative stabilities of these species are

determined by the overall metal composition ratio Fe/Cu.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#32:1> That is, a given two-metal system may have several predominance area

dia <l> grams, each corresponding to a particular metal composition range.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-037#33:1> In the literature, two-metal and higher order predominance area

diagrams are not well documented.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#34:1> Unlike the one-metal diagram which, in principle, can be produced

with the aid of a hand calculator, the two-metal predominance diagram is gen

<l> erally not as easy to calculate.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#35:1> Diagrams which are published have often been tediously generated and

they may be limited to a single multi-metal compound.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#36:1> It is possible to map all equi <l> libria by means of sophisticated

Gibbs energy minimization algorithms, but this is not a simple approach and

requires access to powerful software <fnr> [ 16-23] </fnr> <footnote> <O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-037#85:1> Let us now extend the algorithm to systems containing more than

one metallic ( base element) component.

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-037#89:1> Figure 3 shows the Fe-Al-S-0 system at 800 K.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#90:1> The axes are log <sb> 10 </sb> <it> P </it> ( SO <sb> 2 </sb> ) and

log <sb> 10 </sb> <it> P </it> ( O <sb> 2 </sb> ) .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#91:1> The diagram was calculated by superimposing <}> <-> Fig. </-> <+>

Figure </+> </}> 1 with the Al-S-O one-metal pre <l> dominance area diagram.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#92:1> Any possible two-metal compounds formed between Fe- and Al-bearing

species do not appear.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#93:1> In <}> <-> Fig. </-> <+> Figure </+> </}> 3 there are two " base

elements", Fe and Al.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#94:1> Each domain contains two species, one Fe-bearing and one Al-bearing.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-037#95:1> As with the one-metal diagram, there are " <it> Y </it> - type"

invariant points formed by three intersecting univariant lines ( for exam <l>

ple point 'a' in <}> <-> Fig. </-> <+> Figure </+> </}> 3).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#96:1> The invariant point consists of four coexisting species, three of

which are interacting with respect to one of the metals ( Fe:- FeS, FeS <sb>

2 </sb> and Fe <sb> 3 </sb> O <sb> 4 </sb> ) and the fourth non-reacting

species from the other metal ( Al:- Al <sb> 2 </sb> O <sb> 3 </sb> ) . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-037#97:1> In <}> <-> Fig. </-> <+> Figure </+> </}> 3, there is a new type

of invariant point formed by four domains ( point 'b')
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#98:1> This represents a reaction involving two Fe-bearing ( FeSO <sb> 4

</sb> and <space> Fe <sb> 2 </sb> ( SO <sb> 4 </sb> ) <sb> 3 </sb> ) and two

Al-bearing ( Al <sb> 2 </sb> ( SO <sb> 4 </sb> ) <sb> 3 </sb> and Al <sb> 2

</sb> O <sb> 3 </sb> ) .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#99:1> The invariant point is produced by two intersecting univariant lines

from each one-metal diagram.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#100:1> The domains at the point form the shape of a letter 'X' with two

straight lines. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-037#101:1> Figure 3 is a convenient way of combining and comparing two

one-metal systems but it provides little new information. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-037#102:1> Let us introduce a two-metal compound into the system.

<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#106:1> The range of <it> R </it> is simply given by the metallic

<ICE-CAN:W2A-037#107:1> Hence it follows that a two-metal predominance area diagram is a

function of the atomic ratio of the two metals, the limits of which can be

deduced from the chemical formulae of the species containing the base

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-037#108:1> In order to compute the true two-metal predominance area

include two base elements.
