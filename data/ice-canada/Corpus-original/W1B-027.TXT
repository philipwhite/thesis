<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#1:1> <h> To Whom It May Concern: </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#2:1> <@> Jude Beth Peters </@> , currently a student in Modern

Languages and Literature at the <@> Eaton </@> University, has asked me to

write a letter of reference to the Canadian Federation of University Women on

her behalf.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#3:1> I do so with great pleasure. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#4:1> She is applying for a Professional Fellowship.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#5:1> I understand that I am asked to give testimony to her <quote> "

scholarship, potential and personal qualities," </quote> in this regard. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#6:1> Prior to my taking up duties in this position I was a full-time

Associate Professor in the Department of Communication Studies where <@> Jude

</@> did her undergraduate degree.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#7:1> She is probably the most brilliant student to come through that

Department in my twenty-seven years as a teacher there.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#8:1> I say this because <@> Jude </@> was awarded the <@> Collegial </@>

Medal at her graduation in June of 1996.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#9:1> She is the first and only student in our programme to be so honoured.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#10:1> This medal, which is not necessarily awarded each year, represents

the highest honour for an undergraduate student at our University.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#11:1> The medal recognizes outstanding achievement, exceptional leadership,

creativity and substantial service to the outside community. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#12:1> In submitting her name for this prestigious award two colleagues

and I contacted each of her previous teachers at this University.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#13:1> All of them immediately agreed to write letters of support on her

behalf and felt privileged to do so.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#14:1> This was unheard of at our University. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#15:1> In terms of her scholarship and potential, <@> Jude </@> 's

degree is in Communication Studies, the first programme of its kind in Canada

and a recognized leader internationally in scholarship and creativity.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#16:1> She came to us with a background in literature and literary

criticism.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#17:1> This afforded her a depth in the analysis and criticism of media and

communicative acts.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#18:1> It also gave her an appropriate balance in her creative work in film.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#19:1> One of her films, <it> <@> Lemon Snap </@> </it> , was reviewed by

the major Montreal film critic who gave it excellent reviews.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#20:1> Her acceptance at <@> Langwith </@> College, <@> Eaton </@> , is only

further testimony to her extraordinary abilities and potential in

scholarship. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#21:1> <@> Jude </@> was also hired on two sequential full-time

contracts to act as teaching assistant in film.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#22:1> The students with whom she worked often spoke to me of her

outstanding contribution to them both in her capacity as a teacher and as a

filmmaker.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#23:1> She did and, I am also informed, still commands the respect of both

her fellow students and of her professors. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#24:1> She is a delight to work with and I can say, speaking not only

for myself but her former teachers, that each of us learned as much, if not

more, from <@> Jude </@> as she did from us.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#25:1> She has brought renown to the Department of Communication Studies and

to <@> Collegial </@> University.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#26:1> She will continue to do so in her endeavours at <@> Eaton </@> and

beyond.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#27:1> I recommend her to you with the highest of recommendations. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#28:1> Sincerely, <@> Philip Duncan </@>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#29:1> Vice-Dean </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#30:2> <h> Letter of Reference - Academic Referee for <@> Jude Peters </@>

</h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#31:2> <@> Jude Peters </@> is applying for a Celanese Canada

International Fellowship in order to pursue a post-graduate course of study

in film direction at the National Film School, London, England.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#32:2> She has asked me to write this letter on her behalf and I do so with

great pleasure and honour. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#33:2> I have known <@> Jude </@> since September of 1993.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#34:2> She was in the undergraduate programme in Communication Studies at

<@> Collegial </@> University.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#35:2> At the time I was an Associate Professor in the Department.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#36:2> I was her teacher in two courses, her supervisor in a directed (

honours) project and an advisor to her throughout her undergraduate academic

career.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#37:2> I know her work very well.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#38:2> At the time of her graduation I organized with the assistance of

eleven of my colleagues, her successful candidacy for the <@> Collegial </@>

Medal of 1996 - an honour which is not necessarily given each year.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#39:2> It was the first time at this University that so many professors of

an individual student had made such a request.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#40:2> Those of us who knew and worked with <@> Jude </@> were not

surprised.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#41:2> Since <@> Jude </@> 's graduation in 1996, I have kept in touch with

her on a regular basis in matters regarding her academic and professional

projects. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#42:2> <@> Jude </@> speaks of a " stewardship" of Canadian cultural

material, her plan to attend the National Film School next year, and of her

work this year at <@> Eaton </@> University, <@> Langwith </@> College, in

studying the historical relationship among language, image and symbol.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#43:2> I believe that my previous sentence accurately sums up <@> Jude

Peters </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#44:2> She has a tremendous intellect and intellectual curiosity.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#45:2> Those of us who have worked with her have been constantly struck by

her intricate ability to synthesize and develop nascent conclusions in

interrelated matters.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#46:2> Hence her passion for the relationships among language, imagery and

symbols and her drive to go to <@> Eaton </@> to immerse herself in an

environment which allows her to do just that. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#47:2> She now plans to direct this energy to the development of film

imagery on an international scale.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#48:2> Her choice of the National Film School is particularly apt for it

allows her to build upon one of her many undergraduate strengths for which

the university recognized her with its medal.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#49:2> One of her undergraduate films, <@> Lemon Snap </@> , won critical

praise from Montreal's leading film critic.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#50:2> With this second stage, we come to the synthesis of intellect and

creativity in <@> Jude </@> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#51:2> These two stages blend together in a sense of dedication, purpose

and responsibility in <@> Jude </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#52:2> This is what I understand by her use of the word " stewardship".
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#53:2> For in <@> Jude </@> , it is not enough to conceive of a project and

see it through to fruition.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#54:2> She also has the abiding sense of personal and communal

responsibility for her own acts and thoughts.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#55:2> And this quality in her I saw over and over again while she was a

student at <@> Collegial </@> University.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#56:2> I heard it from her fellow students.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#57:2> I saw it come to pass in her work with Highland history in

south-eastern Ontario.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#58:2> And, I heard testimonial after testimonial to this effect from native

and white participants in a documentary <@> Jude </@> produced in Northern

Quebec. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#59:2> I understand from your own documentation that you are interested

in the applicant's academic merit and suitability for the proposed program.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#60:2> I believe I have addressed these points above.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#61:2> I would especially draw your attention to <@> Jude </@> 's

outstanding undergraduate transcript.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#62:2> Her success in this area speaks volumes to her eventual success in

her proposed program at the National Film School, not to mention her

contribution this year at <@> Eaton </@> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#63:2> I find it most encouraging that the Celanese Canada

Internationalist Fellowship provides <quote> " opportunities for

international study, or a combination of study / research, or study / work (

internship)" </quote> for people of academic merit and personal suitability.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#64:2> Here too <@> Jude </@> is a primary candidate. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#65:2> While <@> Jude </@> was an undergraduate student she was hired on

two sequential full-time contracts as teaching assistant in film.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#66:2> The students with whom she worked often spoke to me of her

outstanding contribution to them in her capacity as a teacher, filmmaker and

human being.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#67:2> She did, and I am informed, still commands the deep respect of both

her fellow students and of her professors. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#68:2> Her letter of purpose for this fellowship indicates her desire to

work on the international scale in communication and film media.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#69:2> <@> Jude </@> embodies the qualities your fellowship seeks.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#70:2> Her entire academic path has been one characterized by a combination

of study, research and work.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#71:2> Her nature and personality are such that <@> Jude </@> welcomes

challenges in cross-cultural areas.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#72:2> As indicated in my previous comments, this has been a hallmark of her

work at university and in her personal life as well. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#73:2> In closing, I would say that in the evaluation of the applicant's

performance ( number 3 on your reference form) were there a category for top

1%, I would have no hesitation and full justification to locate <@> Jude </@>

in each of the categories you present in that ranking.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#74:2> And I say this having taught a total of over three thousand students

for twenty-eight years. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#75:2> <@> Jude </@> is a delight to work with and I can say, speaking

not only for myself but for her former teachers as well, that each of us

learned as much, if not more, from <@> Jude </@> as she did from us.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#76:2> She has brought renown to this University and she will certainly do

so in her endeavours at <@> Eaton </@> and beyond.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#77:2> <@> Jude </@> deserves the opportunity to continue her work beyond

<@> Eaton </@> and I can assure you that she will in this regard also bring

international acclaim and honour to our country as well. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#78:2> Yours most sincerely, <@> Philip Duncan </@>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#79:2> Vice-Dean </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#80:3> <h> Dear Colleagues: </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#81:3> <@> Ali Abouhassan </@> has written to me requesting a letter of

support for his application for the position we are advertising.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#82:3> I feel quite honoured to do so, especially given the compelling case

for his candidacy. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#83:3> Our field has long recognized International and Intercultural

Communication as a main thread of study and scholarship.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#84:3> This goes back for over half a century.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#85:3> <@> Ali </@> comes from this field and has impeccable credentials to

recommend him very highly as a scholar on the international front.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#86:3> However it is not for this reason that I most keenly recommend his

appointment to our Department. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#87:3> As academics in the field of Communication we all are aware of

the central role media and communication play in information, global

awareness and cultural changes.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#88:3> In <@> Ali </@> , however, we find not only a highly accomplished

scholar in this field, we find a person who clearly integrates scholarship in

this area with an acutely personal experience of the challenges and problems

communication and media now face and will face for the next few decades.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#89:3> His letter to the Committee is testimony to that fact.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#90:3> This is no small matter.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#91:3> To be fortunate enough to find such a scholar allows us, as a

Department, to build upon our strengths in the field by welcoming a person

who simultaneously can operate within objective and subjective areas.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#92:3> In <@> Ali </@> our Department will have a teacher and scholar who

blends academic rigour with particular insights on the problems at hand

derived from long and fruitful analysis of and presence with the very topics

he studies.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#93:3> Indeed, we have in our own experience with him a proven track record

of my statement. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#94:3> His evaluations of teaching at the undergraduate and graduate

level are also very persuasive.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#95:3> His successful ability to meet those requests and challenges we asked

of him a few years back only serves to underscore the good fortune our

Department has in finding a person of his talents in teaching and research.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#96:3> While I was undertaking to direct the MA programme a few years

back and during my term as director, I was often told by colleagues and

students of the respect they had for <@> Ali </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#97:3> I truly believe his departure at the end of his limited term

appointment was a real loss for us.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#98:3> We now have a second chance to work with this individual who so

clearly embodies what each of us seeks in a candidate for scholarly

recognition by those outside our programme and for what we understand as our

philosophy and direction of Communication Studies. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#99:3> As a group we have had several meaningful discussions as to the

future of our Department within this University and within the field as a

whole.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#100:3> We spoke about the urgency of developing strategies for

Communication Studies to contribute meaningfully in areas of global exchange.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#101:3> We focused on the development of multi-media projects and global

forms of media and communication.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#102:3> In <@> Ali </@> we have, given our intent, a person who can

contribute directly to our own sense of our future and who will bring with

him a level of international and global respect which we need to move in

those areas which we have identified.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#103:3> Communication Studies needs Dr. <@> Ali </@> <@> Abouhassan </@> .

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#104:3> Yours sincerely, <@> Philip Duncan </@>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-027#105:3> Vice-Dean </p> </I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#106:4> The following information has now been confirmed at this hour by

<@> Marie Ganier </@> of <@> TUP </@> on behalf of <@> Chloe Lavigne </@> (

our regular contact there): </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-027#107:4> Sous-commission &hash; 6 will have its first meeting on

Wednesday, January 21 and sous-commission &hash;7 will have its first meeting

on Thursday, January 22.
