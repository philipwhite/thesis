<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#1:1:A> <@> John Keenan </@> is the founder of the Home Run foundation

which is co-ordinating the programme
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#2:1:A> He joins me now
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#3:1:A> Good morning Mister uh <@> Keenan </@>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#4:1:B> Good morning

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#5:1:A> Now how uh would this programme work <,> how would you get kids

out to the ball game

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#6:1:B> Well uhm <,> the key is publicity I mean uh we believe that uh

<,> with the help of the media we'll get quite a few out uhn large numbers uh
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#7:1:B> we're going after the corporations to buy blocks of seats uhn large

number of blocks of seats uh <,> for our kids charities and our

underprivileged <.> stu </.> organizations that are in and around Montreal so

we're very confident that with media support uh corporations will uh will

donate heavily

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#8:1:A> What kind of incentives are you giving to the companies <}> <->

to </-> <=> to </=> </}> try to buy these blocks of tickets

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#9:1:B> Well <,> again <,> publicity uh widespread exposure the uh <,>

the stadium scoreboard will offer publicity uh <{> <[> radio </[> TV

newspapers

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#10:1:A> <[> Okay </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#11:1:A> Do they get a tax write-off

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#12:1:B> <{> <[> Absolutely </[> they will <,> absolutely uhm
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#13:1:B> <}> <-> any </-> <=> any </=> </}> uh organization any non-profit

organization <}> <-> can </-> <=> can </=> </}> get a uh tax receipt
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#14:1:B> so as long as uh <.> th </.> the organization that they're buying

the ticket for is non-profit they will get a tax receipt

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#15:1:A> <[> Okay </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#16:1:A> Okay uhm <}> <-> i </-> <=> it </=> </}> occurs to me that uhm

that <}> <-> if if </-> <=> if </=> </}> you know <}> <-> this is </-> <=>

these are </=> </}> hard times for the Expos that this is a way of shoring up

their good fortunes I <}> <-> <.> spose </.> </-> <+> suppose </+> </}> <O>

laugh </O>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#17:1:B> Uh no doubt about that <,> but uh we're you know we're looking

at this from a different angle actually

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#18:1:A> Okay that's not your concern
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#19:1:A> Cos one of the things that I would wonder is whether <}> <-> when

</-> <=> when </=> </}> certainly in mid-week games the Expos have uh plenty

of seats open uh whether you might approach the team for them to donate uh

tickets for various organizations as well

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#20:1:B> Uh absolutely
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#21:1:B> they have agreed uh they already have a plan set up where uh any

charitable organization that buys a ticket <,> is donated a couple of dollars

uh from the Expos <{> <[> X </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#22:1:A> <[> Mmm </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#23:1:B> So they do receive uh a couple of dollars so the Expos are

doing already quite a lot in that regard they have been for years and uh and

they have <}> <-> their </-> <=> their </=> </}> own foundation set up <,>

through Bronfman <&> charity foundation </&> that uh issues tickets <,> to

<w> kids' </w> organizations so what we're doing is <?> a </?> little

different in that we're <}> <-> a </-> <=> asking </=> </}> corporations to

buy seats so it's more revenue generating

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#24:1:A> And <}> <-> what <.> s </.> </-> <=> what stage </=> </}> are

uh are things at right now
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#25:1:A> Have you got companies on board at this point

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#26:1:B> Uh at the moment it's word of mouth uh <,> my own contacts

that I have uh
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#27:1:B> There are a lot of uhm people out there volunteers and so on that

that are spreading the word around
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#28:1:B> But we hope that the uhm <}> <-> th </-> <=> the </=> </}>

widespread publicity that we hope to generate anyway <}> <-> will </-> <=>

will </=> </}> Get the word out and our message and our concept out to the

corporations

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#29:1:A> Have you uh got special co-operation from the team as well

when you mentioned the business <}> <-> of </-> <=> of </=> </}> flashing

things up on the board uhm <}> <-> it </-> <=> it </=> </}> suggests that

you've got the team on board for this

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#30:1:B> Yes I do uh <&> Expo owner Claude </&> Brochu uh responded

very favourably uh to it and uh he's given me uh his full support <,> in that

uh <,> you know for <?> your <?> for publicity uh in the <}> <-> <.> score

</.> </-> <+> scoreboard </+> </}> on the scoreboard and uh as well <}> <->

there are </-> <=> there are </=> </}> uh <,> media logos that uh could be

used for upcoming promotions and special events uh maybe not this year but

certainly next year and we are looking to <,> get it started this year at

least uh
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#31:1:B> sort of a dry run test pilot this year to see what kinds of <?>

objections </?> we come up with but <{> <[> it's full-fledged </[> <[> we

hope to have it in operation full-fledged <{> <[> <}> <-> next y- </-> <=>

next season </=> </}> </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#32:1:A> <[> Mmm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#33:1:A> Okay what brought you to this project
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#34:1:A> Are you just a big baseball fan or what was your interest in doing

this

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#35:1:B> Well uhm I was having a haircut one day actually and I asked

the hairdresser if uh he was a baseball fan and his answer was that he really

didn't care much for it didn't really understand it all that much uh the game

was too slow for him et cetera he probably would never go to a game
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#36:1:B> But what was strange is <,> he still has a very vivid and fond

memory of the great <,> time he had <}> <-> as a </-> <{> <[> <=> as a </=>

</}> boy scout </[> </[> when he went uh to an Expos game with a group of uh

other Boy Scouts
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#37:1:B> And they all brought their gloves and they sat in the furthest

seats and he still talks about that and he goes <quote> that was <,> the time

of my life </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#38:1:B> So that was when I started to realize that you know this game is uh

is very much uh a kid's game and we should remember that

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#39:1:A> <[> As a kid mmm </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#40:1:A> And <}> <-> do you </-> <=> would you </=> </}> have certain

charitable organizations <}> <-> that you </-> <=> that you've </=> </}>

already linked up with or non-profit organizations <}> <-> or </-> <=> or

</=> </}> how would you tap into <}> <-> those </-> <=> those </=> </}> kids

<}> <-> who </-> <=> who </=> </}> could benefit from going to a baseball

game

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#41:1:B> Well uhm we uh we hope to approach uhm a couple of uh <}> <->

we're </-> <=> we're </=> </}> specifically looking at the underprivileged

youth <,> here in Montreal so we'll probably go after ah ah <,,> some of the

bigger names <}> <-> that </-> <=> that </=> </}> everyone knows <?> them

</?> <{> <[> but <.> wh </.> </[> <@> Star Teens </@> for example
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#42:1:B> But we haven't approached anybody yet we are right now at the stage

of uh of getting the media to get on board

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#43:1:A> <[> <@> Star Teens </@> </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#44:1:A> Well we've done our bit <O> laugh </O>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#45:1:B> Yes you have and thank you very much

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#46:1:A> Okay <.> s </.> well good luck with this <{> <[> it's </[>

certainly a very uh noble effort on your part

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#47:1:B> <[> Thanks </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#48:1:B> I appreciate it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#49:1:B> Thank you for giving us uh the airtime

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#50:1:A> No sweat
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#51:1:A> <}> <-> <.> I </.> </-> <=> I've </=> </}> been speaking with <@>

John Keenan </@> he's coordinator of <quote> Take Me Out to the Ball Game

</quote> and that's a programme that <}> <-> <.> hopes to get </.> </-> <+>

or aims to get </+> </}> underprivileged kids out to see the Expos </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#52:2:A> Well <,> no one wants to think about dying but preparing for

that <}> <-> eventually </-> <=> ah eventuality </=> </}> I should say <,>

certainly saves a family and friends a lot of confusion and frustration
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#53:2:A> People who prepare a proper will tend to minimize the conflicts

that can arise after their death and sometimes split up families
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#54:2:A> Joining me now to talk about what people should know before writing

a will is <@> Georges Arnaud </@>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#55:2:A> He's a lawyer who specializes in estate tax planning
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#56:2:A> Good morning

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#57:2:B> Good morning

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#58:2:A> Now <,> <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> think for most of us

<,> particularly if we're young <,> we're thinking that this is something way

off <,> on the horizon
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#59:2:A> um at what point should we consider writing up a will

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#60:2:B> Well I think the first thing to do is to uh make a global

inventory of the assets that you might leave after death <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#61:2:B> Because today as the law is working in taxes uh with the estate <}>

<-> is </-> <=> uh is </=> </}> the following <&> French speaker </&>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#62:2:B> They would take for granted that the day before your death you

would have sold all of your assets
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#63:2:B> That is called the Deemed Disposition
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#64:2:B> And <}> <-> it's the uh </-> <=> it's the </=> </}> sanction from

the income tax law
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#65:2:B> It's both for federal and provincial tax law
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#66:2:B> So what you have to <,> take into consideration is the kind of

assets that you are leaving <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#67:2:B> Ah if I could take the example of the R S Ps <&> retirement savings

plan </&> for example <,> uhm the R S P <}> <-> would be ah </-> <=> would be

</=> </}> deemed to be disposed of <,> which means that it's like if today

you were withdrawing all of your <unclear> word </unclear>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#68:2:A> Gee

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#69:2:B> So what it means is that this would be considered as <,> a

salary and it would be added to all other incomes during the same year
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#70:2:B> <{1> <[1> so </[1> If someone leaves like I don't know like for

example an hundred thousand dollars <&> speaker doesn't say 'one' </&> of R S

Ps or pension plan <,> or both <,> ah that would be considered as being

income plus what <,> what has been earned during the same year
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#71:2:B>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#72:2:B> <{2> <[2> So <unclear> word </unclear> </[2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#73:2:A> <[1> And </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#74:2:A> <[2> So you're saying that even if someone's young <}> <->

they may </-> <=> they may </=> </}> have more of an estate than they think

of <,> because we're not thinking about things like R S Ps </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#75:2:B> Yeah sure
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#76:2:B> I mean uh you could have like uh pension or sometimes you know

people <}> <-> would be uh </-> <=> would be uh </=> </}> leaving a company

and would have some kind of compensation and that could be roll-overed <&>

not " rolled over" </&> into the R S Ps

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#77:2:A> Mmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#78:2:B> So <}> <-> it </-> <=> it </=> </}> brings a lot of money at

the end
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#79:2:B> <{1> <[1> So </[1> that that could be taxable at least at fifty

percent
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#80:2:B> So meaning that's fifty thousand dollars goes to the government and

the other portion to whoever is concerned
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#81:2:B> Unless you have <}> <-> <.> prop </.> </-> <=> proper </=> </}>

provision in your will for that <{2> <[2> like </[2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#82:2:A> <[1> <.> th </.> <.> th </.> </[1> </{1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#83:2:A> <[2> now <}> <-> how <,> </-> <=> just how </=> </}> proper do

you have to be in drawing up a will
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#84:2:A> I mean you hear of people making sort of scribbled notes on paper
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#85:2:A> Uhm what sort of document is considered a will </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#86:2:B> Well <,> any written document <,> uh draft by the person

itself
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#87:2:B> Like <,> <}> <-> <}> <-> <.> i </.> </-> <=> if </=> </}> you </->

<=> you </=> </}> have like three kind of will that could be uh drafted
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#88:2:B> You have the autographed will <,> which is a will that could be

drafted by the person
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#89:2:B> You don't need any witnesses for that
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#90:2:B> It has to be dated and signed and all <,> with the handwriting of

the person

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#91:2:A> And then I <}> <-> spose </-> <+> suppose </+> </}> you should

let somebody know that you've done this

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#92:2:B> Well it's preferable because otherwise it could be lost or it

could be thrown away and nobody would know
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#93:2:B> So that's the difficulty with that kind of will
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#94:2:B> The other two kinds of will that you can have is the ah notorial

will <,> which is well-known in Quebec <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#95:2:B> But it's only for Quebec

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#96:2:A> You draw it up with a notary then

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#97:2:B> That's right
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#98:2:B> And the other uh the other kind of will would be uh drafted and

acknowledged by two witnesses
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#99:2:B> This is the England form of will
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#100:2:B> Which is the uh most frequent in all of the provinces and even in

the States

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#101:2:A> Hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#102:2:B> Uh that's actually <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> kind of

will that we are drafting <}> <-> With the </-> <=> with the </=> </}>

lawyers <{> <[> here </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#103:2:A> <[> >Ah <unclear> word </unclear> okay </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#104:2:A>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#105:2:A> Now <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> know that lately I did up a

will because <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> now have young children and so

even if I don't consider myself a <}> <-> weathly person <O> laugh </O> </->

<=> wealthy person </=> </}> I wanted to uhm look after their care and

maintenance
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#106:2:A> I <}> <-> spose </-> <+> suppose </+> </}> that's another aspect

that people <.> m </.> they <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> consider
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#107:2:A> You're not just <,> talking about what you want done with your

goods after you leave but also perhaps the care of your children

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#108:2:B> Yeah exactly
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#109:2:B> You see uh not only do you have <}> <-> to ah </-> <=> to know

</=> </}> what kind of assets that you have but you also have to know <,>

what kind of protection you <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> leave

for the beneficiaries
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#110:2:B> If I take the example uh of <}> <-> your </-> <=> your </=> </}>

children for example <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#111:2:B> You could have <,> like a trust created in your will <,> so that

the money will be administered till they reach a certain age <,> under which

they should receive all of the assets or a portion of the assets
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#112:2:B> Uh you have two aspects in it <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#113:2:B> You have a protection <,> against themselves <,> and you also have

a protection in term of access also
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#114:2:B> So you have like two benefits to create that kind <}> <-> of uh

</-> <=> of trust </=> </}> <{1> <[1> that <unclear> word </unclear> </[1>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#115:2:A> <[1> You say protecting against themselves making sure they

<}> <-> won't </-> <=> don't </=> </}> burn through all their money <}> <->

by <,> </-> <=> between </=> </}> age eighteen and twenty sort of <{> <[>

thing </[> </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#116:2:B> <[2> Exactly <{3> <[3> yeah sure </[3> </[2> </{2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#117:2:A> <[3> Okay </[3> </{3>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#118:2:A> Uhm what are the kinds of things that people often forget <}> <->

to <.> consi </.> </-> <=> <}> <-> to </-> <=> to </=> </}> look at </=> </}>

when drawing up a will

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#119:2:B> Well <,> mostly <}> <-> it's the </-> <=> it's to </=> </}>

consider <,> <}> <-> the uhm </-> <=> the kind </=> </}> of taxes that they

would have because they don't <{4> <[4> know </[4> the specificities <}> <->

in </-> <=> in </=> </}> term of taxes

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#120:2:A> <[4> Hmm </[4> </{4>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#121:2:A> Whether there's a difference if you leave it to your spouse

or your children <{> <[> for example hmm </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-041#122:2:B>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#123:2:B> <[> That's right </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#124:2:B> Okay <,> because sometimes you <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+>

</}> leave a portion to X and a portion to Y <,> but it might be preferable

to <,> go <,> by a certain way or give certain <,> specific assets to a

certain person because that would be tax free and <}> <-> the </-> <=> in the

</=> </}> other case it wouldn't be <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-041#125:2:B> So you have to think about that </I>
