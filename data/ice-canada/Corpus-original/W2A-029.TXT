captive-born deer mice ( <foreign> <it> Peromyscus maniculatus </it>

</foreign> Wagner) from mainland Nova Scotia and from an isolated predator-

<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#9:1> Locomotor activity did not differ consistently between populations,

but wall-seeking was significantly greater in mainland mice.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#10:1> When exposed to an artificial tree, insular mice made more climbs

than mainland mice, but mainland mice climbed for longer periods.

<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#13:1> <h> <bold> Introduction </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#14:1> The deer mouse <foreign> <it> Peromyscus maniculatus </it>

</foreign> occurs throughout North America in a variety of habitats.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#15:1> The species is morpho <l> logically and behaviorally diverse, with

some of the most divergent forms occurring on islands.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#16:1> The behavioral reper <l> toire of <foreign> <it> Peromyscus </it>

</foreign> is well documented ( Eisenberg 1968) and numerous interspecific

comparisons exist ( Horner 1954; King <it> et al </it> . 1968; Layne 1969;

Layne and Ehrhart 1970; Wolff <it> et al </it> . 1983; Wolff 1985; Wolff and

Durr 1986), but only a few behavioral studies ( Sullivan 1977; Halpin and

Sullivan 1978; Halpin 1981) have compared adjacent insular and mainland

conspecific populations. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#17:1> In the laboratory, we compared activity and climbing behavior,

including nest height preference, in <foreign> <it> P. maniculatus </it>

</foreign> from Isle Haute in the Bay of Fundy and from adjacent main <l>

land Nova Scotia.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#18:1> Several <foreign> <it> Peromyscus </it> </foreign> species, including

<foreign> <it> P. maniculatus </it> </foreign> , appear morphologically and

behaviorally adapted to a semiarboreal existence ( Horner 1954; Taylor and

McCarley 1963; King <it> et al </it> . 1968; Klein and Layne 1978; Tadlock

and Klein 1979; Dewsbury <it> et al </it> . 1980; Newton <it> et al </it> .

1980; Stah 1980; Harney 1983).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#19:1> These adaptations are usually related to habitat structure ( Meserve

1976) or to selective pres <l> sures from ground-dwelling predators ( Foster

1965) or com <l> petitors ( M'Closkey 1976; Holbrook 1978, 1979; Newton <it>

et al </it> . 1980; Harney 1983).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#20:1> Since habitats of the mainland and island populations in our study

were structurally similar, differences in arboreality or locomotor behavior

between the two groups would likely reflect differences in predation or

interspecific competition, or random change, between the two locations. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#21:1> In general, behavioral differences between island and main <l>

land populations could reflect genetic differences ( selection pressures,

origin, or drift) or differences in experience.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#22:1> To separate the evolutionary and genetic components of these

behaviors, we compared the behavior of wild-caught and captive-born mice from

the two populations.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#23:1> We predicted that island mice, relative to mainland mice, would be (

<it> i </it> ) more active and less evasive of open space, ( <it> ii </it> )

less arboreal, and ( <it> iii </it> ) less likely to construct aboveground

nests. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#24:1> <h> <bold> Materials and methods </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#25:1> Deer mice were collected from Isle Haute, an isolated island

plateau in the upper Bay of Fundy ( 45&degree;15'N, 65&degree;00'W), and on

the mainland in Cumberland and Colchester counties, Nova Scotia (

45&degree;20' - 45&degree;50'N, 63&degree;50' - 64&degree;55'W).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#26:1> Isle Haute is similar topo <l> graphically and vegetatively to the

mainland study areas ( Rowe 1972), but lacks the mainland complement of

terrestrial quadrupedal predators and interspecific competitors.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#27:1> In fact, <foreign> <it> P. maniculatus </it> </fpreign> is the only

terrestrial mammal resident on the island.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#28:1> Extensive divergence in cranial morphometry between Isle Haute and

mainland populations indicates long-term isolation of the island populations

( Colquohoun 1983). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#29:1> The laboratory colony of <foreign> <it> P. maniculatus </it>

</foreign> at Acadia University included wild-caught and first-generation

captive-born mice from both study areas.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#30:1> The colony was established in 1980 and until 1984 was supplemented

annually with wild-caught mice.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#31:1> Few litters were conceived in the laboratory.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#32:1> Rather, females that were pregnant when captured bore their young in

captivity. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#33:1> Mice were housed in male-female pairs in 28 x 17 x 13 cm poly <l>

styrene cages with stainless steel lids.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#34:1> Cage floors were covered with wood shavings, and nonabsorbent cotton

was supplied for nesting material.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#35:1> Laboratory chow, sunflower seeds, and water were pro <l> vided

<foreign> <it> ad libitum </it> </foreign> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#36:1> Cages were kept in a vivarium at 17&degree;C with photo-period set at

16L:8D. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#37:1> Two sets of experiments, climbing trials and nest height

selection, were conducted within an indoor observation room measuring 2.8 x

1.6 x 2.4 m. <O> graph </O> <O> graph caption </O>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#38:1> The observation room floor was gridded into 28 ( 4 x 7) 40-cm squares

and was lightly covered with moistened leaves or wood shavings.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#39:1> Individuals were observed through a 58 x 44 cm window of one-way

glass.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#40:1> The observation area was illuminated by three 40-W incandescent red

lights.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#41:1> During each trial, fresh water and sunflower seeds were provided

<foreign> <it> ad libitum </it> </foreign> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#42:1> After each trial, the observation room and furnishings were cleaned

with soap and hot water ( 70&degree;C) before new litter was applied to the

floor. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#43:1> In each group ( i.e., Isle Haute wild-caught and captive-born,

main <l> land wild-caught and captive-born), adult mice were randomly chosen

for both experiments from a pool in which most males were nonscrotal and

females were not pregnant or lactating.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#44:1> In each experi <l> ment mice were used only once; however, most mice

were used for both experiments. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#45:1> Climbing trials were conducted at least 2 h after " sunset" and

not later than 2 h before " sunrise."
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#46:1> An expanding wooden clothes rack was placed in the center of the

observation area to serve as a climbing structure ( Fig. 1).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#47:1> This " tree" ( 64 x 50 x 100 cm, outside dimen <l> sions) consisted

of a series of horizontal and diagonal rungs that progressed vertically.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#48:1> Horizontals occurred at levels 25, 47, 73, and 100 cm above the

floor.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#49:1> The tree was sealed with Varathane <sp> ( R) </sp> , a waterproof

preservative, for ease of cleaning.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#50:1> Mice were placed singly inside the observation room and were observed

for 30 min ( three consecutive 10-min periods).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#51:1> Total ground locomotor activity, i.e., number of squares travelled

per unit time ( ACT ) , number of climbing encounters, i.e., all physical

contacts with the tree that resulted in a climb ( CLIMB ) , total climbing

time ( seconds) on tree ( TIME ) , and number of nonclimbing encounters,

i.e., olfactory encounters or physical contacts not resulting in a climb (

NCLIMB) were recorded on audio tape and later transcribed.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#52:1> Total number of encounters ( ENCT = CLIMB + NCLIMB), climbing time

per climbing encounter ( T / CLIMB), ratio of climbing encounters to

nonclimbing encounters ( CLRAT ) , and thigmotaxis or wall-seeking tendency (

WSEEK = ACT / ENCT ) were then calculated. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#53:1> For the nest height selection experiment, three equally spaced

nest boxes were set on a raised platform ( 135 x 14 x 2 cm) located in the

tree 90 cm above the floor.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#54:1> Three additional nest boxes were placed on the floor directly below

the elevated nest sites, with a seventh box placed away from the tree in the

middle of the floor.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#55:1> The modified tree was placed at one end of the observation room

opposite the food and water ( Fig. 2). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#56:1> Nest boxes were constructed from 13-mm plywood and measured 10 x

10 x 10 cm inside, with a removable lid and a 2.5-cm entrance-exit hole in a

lower right quadrant of one of the sides. <O> graph </O> <O> graph caption

</O>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#57:1> The platform and all nest boxes were sealed with Varathane <sp> ( R)

</sp> .
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#58:1> Before each trial, all nest boxes contained an equal amount of fresh

nonabsorbent cotton for bedding. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#59:1> To reduce the chances of deer mice selecting specific nest boxes

because of cues other than nest location, the seven nest boxes for each trial

were randomly chosen from a pool of nine and were randomly positioned on the

tree. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#60:1> Mice were chosen randomly and placed singly inside the observa

<l> tion room approximately 2 h before " sunrise" and left for 6 - 8 hours.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#61:1> Each nest box was then examined for disturbance and presence or

absence of a nest and ( or) mouse.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#62:1> All materials, including the tree, were thoroughly cleaned before the

next trial. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#63:1> Results were analyzed nonparametrically.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#64:1> Spearman rank order correlations between each behavioral variable and

the number of days in captivity were computed to test for the effects of

prolonged cap <l> tivity on behavior.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#65:1> Friedman two-way analysis of variance ( 10-min blocks) was used to

detect any changes in behavior over the 30-min period.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#66:1> Nesting preferences were analyzed with single classification goodness

of fit tests ( Sokal and Rohlf 1969).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#67:1> All other comparisons within and between groups were made with

Mann-Whitney <it> U </it> - tests. </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#69:1> <h> <it> Climbing trials </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#70:1> One hundred and four ( with 21 mainland wild-caught, 32 island

wild-caught, 32 mainland captive-born, and 19 island captive-born mice)

30-min climbing trials were performed.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#71:1> Although the median number of captive days for wild-caught mice was

significantly greater in island ( <it> M </it> = 59.5) than in mainland (

<it> M </it> = 24.5) groups ( <it> U </it> = 230, <it> p </it> = 0.04), the

fre <l> quency distributions of time in captivity were similar for both areas

( <it> G </it> = 1.56, <it> p </it> &gt; 0.1).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#72:1> Total number of tree encounters ( ENCT ) , total climbing time ( TIME )

, wall-seeking tendency ( WSEEK ) , and climbing time per climbing encounter

( T / CLIMB ) were not significantly affected by prolonged captivity in mice

from either location.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#73:1> Ground locomotor activity ( ACT ) , ratio of climbing encounters to

nonclimbing encounters ( CLRAT ) , and total number of climbing encounters (

CLIMB ) decreased signifi <l> cantly with extended captivity in the island

population.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#74:1> In mainland wild-caught deer mice, only the number of non-climbing

encounters ( NCLIMB ) decreased significantly over a 270-day period ( Table

1).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#75:1> With the exception of nonclimbing encounters ( Table 2), no

significant differences between sexes were found within groups. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#76:1> Both wild-caught and captive-born deer mice from Isle Haute

encountered and climbed the tree significantly more often than did their

mainland counterparts.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#77:1> However, both mainland groups spent significantly more time on the

tree per climbing encounter ( Table 2).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#78:1> Ground locomotor activity did not differ in the two wild-caught

groups, but in captive-born groups it was significantly higher in island mice

than in main <l> land mice ( Table 2).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#79:1> As well, mainland groups engaged in wall-seeking behavior

significantly more than did island groups ( Table 2).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#80:1> The number of nonclimbing encounters was significantly higher in Isle

Haute mice ( males and females) than in mainland males, but not females (

Table 2).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#81:1> Total climbing time and the ratio of climbing to nonclimbing

encounters were similar in island and mainland wild-caught groups. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#82:1> In Isle Haute mice, ground locomotor activity and number of

nonclimbing tree encounters were significantly greater in captive-born than

in wild-caught animals ( Table 3).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#83:1> The num <l> ber of climbing encounters and the ratio of climbing to

non-climbing encounters were significantly greater in wild-caught mice.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#84:1> However, total climbing time and climbing time per climbing encounter

did not differ significantly between these groups.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#85:1> The tendency to seek the wall was also similar in the two groups (

Table 3). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#86:1> In mainland deer mice as well, the number of climbs and ratio of

climbing to nonclimbing encounters were significantly greater in wild-caught

than in captive-born animals, but the time per climb was significantly less (

Table 3). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#87:1> Although the pattern of change in behaviors during the 30-min

trials varied slightly, for most behaviors it was similar in mice from both

locations ( Table 4).
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#88:1> Birthplace had less effect on the pattern of responses of mainland

deer mice dur <l> ing the 30-min trial than on the pattern in island deer

mice.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#89:1> Although wall-seeking tendency remained constant, ground locomotor

activity decreased significantly for all groups dur <l> ing the 30-min trial.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#90:1> Total number of encounters and total non-climbing encounters

decreased significantly during the trials in all wild-caught groups.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#91:1> In captive-born groups total number of encounters decreased in island

animals but not in mainland animals; nonclimbing encounters decreased in

mainland ani <l> mals and island females but not island males.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#92:1> Total climbing encounters and the ratio of climbing to nonclimbing

encoun <l> ters remained constant within all groups except wild-caught island

mice, which experienced significant decreases in both of these behaviors.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#93:1> Total climbing time increased significantly in wild-caught island and

captive-born mainland mice.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#94:1> As well, climbing time per climbing encounter increased in all groups

except captive-born island mice ( Table 4). </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#95:1> <h> <it> Nest height selection </it> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2A-029#96:1> One hundred and thirty-nine wild-caught ( 19 mainland, 34 Isle

tested for preference for elevated or ground-level nest sites.
<ICE-CAN:W2A-029#97:1> In every trial all nest boxes were explored, as evidenced by soiled

or disturbed cotton. </p> </I>
