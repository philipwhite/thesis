<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#4:1> the morning a beautiful bottomless bowl but empty <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#5:1> so empty it could make you forget you'd ever felt that sudden blooming

in your chest and gut <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#6:1> of being on the verge when you've caught something miraculous of

knowing the ocean whole <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#7:1> that feeling that if it made a sound would be <it> <O> wommm <O> </it>

as in woman and womb and even <it> wombat </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#8:1> like marsupials we could carry the sea in our bellies </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#9:1> this morning might in truth have been full <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#10:1> teeming with timid suspicious or aloof codfish and untold millions of

mys <l> teries <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#11:1> but i doubted it <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#12:1> slouched on the gunnel yanking listlessly at the line i examined my

boots all morning for possible defects in the manufacturing <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#13:1> found none of those either </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#14:1> into the beautiful emptiness crept fishermen's opinions <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#15:1> shadowy <}> <-> sleightofhand </-> <+> sleight of hand </+> </}>

opinions ( now you see them now you don't) <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#16:1> <it> two women together are two women alone are a lack </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#17:1> <it> a lass and a lack ha ha </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#18:1> <it> an inadequacy </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#19:1> <it> and women alone venturing out to sea are a sly mocking at

Potency </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#20:1> <it> women will cheerfully wander into squalls </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#21:1> <it> sit patiently over schools of mud and sea urchins </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#22:1> <it> catch nothing but dogfish and then go feeling sorry for them

</it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#23:1> we just don't belong on the water some say alone some say at all

<space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#24:1> our flesh too soft our will too weak our body cycles embarrassing

<space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#25:1> our need of a bucket and privacy to pee in instead of pissing manly

over the side </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#26:1> well it may be true about peeing but the rest is a private matter

between ourselves and the sea isn't it? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#27:1> ariel held herself proud all this while interpreting empti <l>

ness her own way <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#28:1> she gazed at the mountainlines un <l> perturbed <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#29:1> <it> people think fish are evolutionary inferiors </it> she said

<space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#30:1> <it> but when you're sitting in a boat like a lonely corner at a

party with a lampshade on your head then you recognize them for what they are

</it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#31:1> <it> guileless </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#32:1> <it> enviably simple </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#33:1> <it> their unity of purpose </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#34:1> <it> so ironic </it> she added <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#35:1> <it> to love the fish and want to kill them </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#36:1> i didn't want to kill them really <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#37:1> i just wanted to catch them <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#38:1> i prayed to the line <it> oh make this beautiful bowl full </it> and

asked ariel <it> do you think they're hiding </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#39:1> a sad fate <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#40:1> to be shunned by such exuberant beauty </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#41:1> after considering this for a long while ariel sighed <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#42:1> <it> no </it> she said <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#43:1> <it> we're hiding </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#44:1> <it> i hope you haven't been letting them near your hook </it>

<space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#45:1> <it> it's our turn </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#46:1> <it> when they've caught us they yell </it> <roman> not it </roman>

<it> and then we're it again </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#47:1> <it> keep your hook behind a rock </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#48:1> <it> that's what I'm doing </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#49:1> <it> we'll fool them girl and they'll </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#50:1> <it> oh </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#51:1> ariel jerked forward pouncing on something in <l> visible but <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#52:1> then she relaxed drawing light and quick <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#53:1> dis <l> appointed before even a first <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#54:1> sighting <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#55:1> <it> oh </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#56:1> <it> what is it </it> i asked </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#57:1> <it> nothing </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#58:1> <it> something that flutters </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#59:1> <it> wriggles </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#60:1> <it> too light for a codfish </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#61:1> <it> fat butterfly maybe </it> i said hopefully <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#62:1> <it> that'd be a change </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#63:1> <it> no </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#64:1> <it> probably a pollock </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#65:1> oh the little pollock <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#66:1> mediocrity of the sea <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#67:1> forever ready to hop aboard unasked <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#68:1> not worth a cent at the size we catch them so we work them off the

hook and send them home <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#69:1> damaged in transit <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#70:1> mark this empty day with a small act of sadism </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#71:1> but breaking free of water the silver rising showed itself for a

shimmying rich-coloured jewel that flew off ariel's hook and hit the deck

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#72:1> <it> holy mackerel what's that </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#73:1> <it> so it is </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#74:1> <it> well </it> came ariel's stuttered laugh and </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#76:1> smooth bar of cobalt blue with emerald stripes <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#77:1> faint opal rainbows on the silvery underside <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#78:1> a persian fish <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#79:1> an arabian nights fish <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#80:1> it held still for a second shocked or amazed then began swimming hard

drum <l> ming sidelong over the deck trying urgently to go its way </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#81:1> curtains of myth and fairytale fell sheer before my eyes <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#82:1> what if it's carrying a ring in its belly <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#83:1> a golden ring inscribed with a plea for help <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#84:1> a queen is under a curse that keeps her a scullerymaid <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#85:1> discovering the message means rescue for the queen <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#86:1> and her freedom releases us from catching fish <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#87:1> this happy task with its terrible aspect of diverting creatures each

from its own urgent message about life </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#88:1> we dropped our lines again but no reply <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#89:1> <it> they're starting to come into the bay </it> said ariel happily

<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#90:1> <it> too bad we don't have our mackerel jigs </it> <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#91:1> <it> we might as well head in </it> <space>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#95:1> which she did and tossed the guts to the gulls <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#96:1> no sign of a ring <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#97:1> if there was a queen she'd go on as a scullerymaid and we'd go on

<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#205:1> annick ce <l> line still in a curve of her settling we let down our

hooks </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#206:1> unwind the line reluctantly <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#207:1> dreams down below under the hull where the dark is fearful <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#208:1> how can we know what lurks there <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#209:1> waiting to foist itself on us <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#210:1> emerge monstrous out of our own imaginations </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#211:1> and ominous nothing turns to conundrum quick indeed <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#212:1> the lines go slack as though the leads were bitten off <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#213:1> tug at them and a weight grabs heavy swooning <it> wommm </it> <&>

sound </&> heavy as the drag of gravity when the earth seems to draw the old

blood down from your womb nearly thawing you to your knees only now there's

no ache only ponderousness <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#214:1> our senses all plunged underwater </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#215:1> <it> here they are </it> ariel gasps </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#216:1> strain at them <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#217:1> they give in <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#218:1> resist <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#219:1> give in and break into air at last <space>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-008#220:1> they're mackerel after all and <space> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#221:1> <it> hoo! they're big </it> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-008#222:1> shun them from the hooks onto the deck and no hesitation but

they begin thundering awesome unnerving as black and grey bars of iron

knocking on the floor at your feet in the night </p> </I>
