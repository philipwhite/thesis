one hundred metres yesterday
<ICE-CAN:S2B-002#123:4:A> Finishing second with the silver Montreal's Bruny Surin
<ICE-CAN:S2B-002#124:4:A> Ben Johnson and his drug-related problems have been the biggest

story in Canadian sprinting till this year
<ICE-CAN:S2B-002#125:4:A> Now that is all in the past </I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-002#139:7:A> Good morning
<ICE-CAN:S2B-002#140:7:A> Well another day another medal for Canada at the World Track and

Field Championships in Goteborg Sweden
<ICE-CAN:S2B-002#141:7:A> This time the honour goes to Kenora Ontario's Michael Smith
<ICE-CAN:S2B-002#142:7:A> He won the bronze in the decathlon <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-002#143:7:A> Smith started the day <,> uh the second day of competition in

fifth place uh but had the longest throws in discus and javelin <,> and those

results propel him to the medal podium
<ICE-CAN:S2B-002#144:7:A> Smith is a veteran decathlete who lately has not lived up to his

potential as one of the best in the world
<ICE-CAN:S2B-002#145:7:A> He's been hampered by a number of little injuries among other

things so it's nice to see him back on track <,> specially since the Atlanta

Olympics are virtually around the corner
<ICE-CAN:S2B-002#146:7:A> Now onto baseball
<ICE-CAN:S2B-002#147:7:A> The Atlanta Braves pounded out eleven hits on route to a five one

win over the Montreal Expos
<ICE-CAN:S2B-002#148:7:A> The Expos' David Segui did extend his hitting streak to seventeen

games driving in the teams' only run in the first inning
<ICE-CAN:S2B-002#149:7:A> And the Toronto Blue Jays lost four straight to the Boston Redsox
<ICE-CAN:S2B-002#150:7:A> The Redsox <,> who are trying to nail down top spot in the

American League <?> east </?> beat the Jays five four in ten innings
<ICE-CAN:S2B-002#151:7:A> That was yesterday afternoon <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-002#152:7:A> The Jays hopes of a wildcard spot fade </I>
