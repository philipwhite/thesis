<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#190:2:B> <,> Uhm <,> let me think
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#191:2:B> I put it in in November
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#192:2:B> <}> <-> We came </-> <=> we moved in </=> </}> in November <,> and

I cleaned it for the first time in April

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#193:2:A> No

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#194:2:B> Ya
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#195:2:B> So like I emptied all the water out <{> <[> <,> wiped </[> it out

rinsed off <}> <-> the uhm </-> <=> the uh </=> </}> gravel <,> <}> <-> and

uhm </-> <,> <=> and then </=> </}> replenished the water

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#196:2:A> <[> Okay </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#197:2:B> It's off at the moment <{> <[> <,> because </[> uhm <,> we

didn't <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> have the background noise <,>

uhm and uh

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#198:2:A> <[> Okay </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#199:2:B> So it's off and the light's off as well
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#200:2:B> But <}> <-> it's </-> <=> it's </=> </}> pretty maintenance-free

really when you consider
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#201:2:B> <}> <-> And I </-> <=> And I </=> </}> don't expect to have to

clean this as often cos <,> I only have one fish in there now
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#202:2:B> And when I had the two <,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#203:2:A> Did one die

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#204:2:B> <,> Yes one passed away
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#205:2:B> <@> Thelma </@> passed away
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#206:2:B> It was a very sad event in my life

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#207:2:B> Ah

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#208:2:A> <O> laugh </O>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#209:2:B> She was smaller and I think <}> <-> she uh </-> <=> she </=>

</}> <,> just <}> <-> here's </-> <=> here's </=> </}> <?> A </?> fork <{>

<[> uh </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#210:2:A> <[> I </[> </{> found one

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#211:2:B> Okay

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#212:2:A>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#213:2:A> They gave me one they didn't tell me

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#214:2:B> She was smaller <,> and uhm <,,> I guess <}> <-> she just

</-> <=> she probably </=> </}> <}> <-> wasn't </-> <=> uh wasn't </=> </}>

well when I got her
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#215:2:B> Cos I was always having to take her out of there and put her in

sick bay
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#216:2:B> I had a little bowl at the side and I'd take some water and scoop

it in and <,> put her in and <,> she'd seem to get better and I'd put her

back in the aquarium and she'd get sick again
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#217:2:B> So she spent more time in sick bay than she did in the <}> <->

bowl </-> <=> in the ah aquarium </=> </}> so

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#218:2:A> It's funny how even goldfish <,> <}> <-> tend take </-> <=>

take on </=> </}> little personalities <{> <[> <,,> because </[> <,> I had

some fish I don't think they were goldfish they were orange I forget <}> <->

what they </-> <=> <,> uh what they </=> </}> were called

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#219:2:B> <[> <,> Oh yeah yeah </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#220:2:A> They were tropical

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#221:2:B> Mm hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#222:2:A> They were quite similar to goldfish <{> <[> <,> and </[>

there was one little guy

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#223:2:B> <[> Mm hmm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#224:2:A> And he used to <@> whizz </@> around that tank
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#225:2:A> <}> <-> He we he </-> <=> He was </=> </}> really really tiny

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#226:2:B> Yeah

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#227:2:A> And <,> and I used to call him <@> Whizzer </@>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#228:2:A> And <}> <-> I was really </-> <=> I really grow <&> not " grew"

</&> </=> </}> fond of that <,> silly little fish

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#229:2:B> Yes

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#230:2:A> And he passed away like it was <,> awwww

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#231:2:B> <{> <[> <O> laugh </O> </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#232:2:A> <[> But when you think </[> </{> about it <O> laugh </O>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#233:2:B> Yeah I was <?> just </?> a little devastated when the little

one went cos <}> <-> I I kept </-> <=> because I had kept </=> </}> nursing

her
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#234:2:B> You know it was harder <,> I mean if I'd just come in and found

her dead I think it would have been easier <{> <[> to deal with </[> but

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#235:2:A> <[> That's right </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#236:2:A> But you did all you could and <?> then </?> <{> <[> <,> she

still </[> passed on

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#237:2:B> <[> Yeah <,> yeah </[> </{> yeah yeah yeah

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#238:2:A> It's <{> <[> too bad </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#239:2:B> <[> But uhm </[> </{> he has quite a personality <}> <-> cos

I </-> <=> when I </=> </}> was cleaning the aquarium I had to put him in the

little bowl <,> and he was very upset <,> with the fact that he was in this

little bowl
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#240:2:B> And he must be quite uhm <,> uh er sensitive to noise <,> because

whenever I would <,> walk in or if <,> there was a flash of light <,> he

would zip around the bowl <,> about five or six times frantically

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#241:2:A> Mm hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#242:2:B> Uhm and <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> never see him do that

in there
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#243:2:B> So I guess uh <,> he was showing his displeasure at the fact that

he was in this uh <,> little bowl
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#244:2:B> <,,> But <}> <-> it's </-> <,> <=> we </=> </}> don't have water

here so it's very awkward in terms of like you know notice if <}> <-> the

</-> <=> there's </=> </}> been a lot of water that has been depleted from

the aquarium just through <,> ordinary uhm evaporation

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#245:2:A> And <}> <-> you're getting </-> <=> that's good cos you're

getting </=> </}> natural evaporation of the water

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#246:2:B> <}> <-> It It's </-> <=> It is </=> </}> good for me yes and

uhm
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#247:2:B> <,> But <}> <-> I <.> ha </.> </-> <=> I </=> </}> find it <O>

sigh </O> <,> awkward to find time <unclear> two or three words </unclear>

<?> this </?> sounds funny it only takes a <}> <-> coupla </-> <+> couple of

</+> </}> minutes to go and get some water and yet you're always so busy <}>

<-> and you're </-> <=> in your </=> </}> day that <,> I mean how many times

do you go to <,> fill up water <}> <-> or or </-> <=> for </=> </}> the

kettle <?> or </?> for the <,> coffee whatever <,,> and yet <,,> can't find

enough time to find <,> water for the <{> <[> </?> poor little </?> fish </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#248:2:A> <[> That's right </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#249:2:A> I have a poor plant that's <&> not " that" </&> you know <,>

gets neglected

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#250:2:B> Mm
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#251:2:B> My spider plant <,> is going to be in <,,> dire straits if I don't

water him tonight

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#252:2:B> And soak him

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#253:2:A> <}> <-> I'm <.> jus </.> </-> <=> I just </=> </}> noticed

the <,> trunk of that tree

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#255:2:A> <[> Is </[> </{> that done on purpose

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#257:2:A> It is

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#258:2:B> Mm hmm
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#259:2:B> <{> <[> <unclear> two words </unclear> </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#260:2:A> <[> So you </[> </{> buy it like that

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#261:2:B> I got that at the <,> greenhouse <{> <[> over in the <?> Hall

</&> all our plants there <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#265:2:B> And um <,,> they're all doing well
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#266:2:B> The only one I didn't get from <,> <indig> <unclear> French name

</unclear> </indig> is the bonsai which is now dead
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#267:2:B> <,,> Uhm that was from <@> Sophia </@>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#268:2:B> <,> It was a gift from her

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#269:2:A> Mm hmm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#270:2:B> When I left the office upstairs cos I helped her
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#271:2:B> <,> So she sent me a bonsai

a bonsai cos I know it's going to die

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#276:2:B> Mm <,> they need a lot of attention
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#277:2:B> Yeah I gave one to my mother
<ICE-CAN:S1A-059#278:2:B> <,> I don't think it lasted very long </I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-059#279:3:A> So your parents were married in thirty-nine <,>
