<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#13:1:C> Okay <,> uh the first question about Europe I refer to are not

that old
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#14:1:C> I refer to the Europe that started to build in nineteen fifty-eight

<,> and the Europe <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> am refering it's not the

post-war <}> <-> <.> Eu </.> </-> <=> Europe </=+> </}> it is <}> <-> the

they call the reflexful co-operation
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#15:1:C> They all together make now

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#16:1:Z> <X> Well first the foundation was with Marshall Aid Americans

<{> <[> and </[> I don't think Americans help any money they are going to

<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#19:1:Z> Okay <[> but ah </[> </{> right anyway we disagree on that because

to me Europe <}> <-> was </-> <=> <.> w </.> </=> </}> they started to build

it in nineteen fifty-eight with the Treaty of Rome
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#20:1:Z> But I'd like to go back at your question though
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#21:1:Z> You said Mister Romeno uh and others are true Canadians

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#22:1:Z> <X> Ya <{> <[> yes sir </[> </X>

in nineteen seventy-nine nineteen eighty <,,> Marc Lalonde then minister of

Alberta was a true Canadian

<$Z> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#24:1:Z> <X> I don't understand why you going so far back you going to

nineteen seventy-nine <}> <-> we live </-> <=> we don't live </=> </}> in

nineteen seventy-nine <{> <[> we </[> live in nineteen eighty-three I mean

nineteen ninety-six </X>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#25:1:C> <[> Well </[> </{> <&> click on the phoneline </&>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#26:1:B> Whoops

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#36:1:C> Yeah because you have been an independent professional for all

your life
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#37:1:C> But <}> <-> that's a </-> <=> that's </=> </}> another issue <,,>

<O> audible exhale breath </O>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#38:1:B> Okay <,> uh his point were the other premiers never tried to

break up the country

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#39:1:B> <{> <[> Lucien Bouchard did </[> <,,> does

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#40:1:C> <[> Which is true </[> </{> yes
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#41:1:C> But there was a view at the time and I want to go back at this when

when there was a real conflict of interest between Alberta there and

Saskatchewan to some extent
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#42:1:C> The oil and natural gas reached <,> provinces uh parts of the

country <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}>

rest of the country and then people were saying well you don't want to share

you want to go your separate way
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#43:1:C> <{> <[> <unclear> word </unclear> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#44:1:B> <[> <}> <-> But </-> <=> But </=> </}> </[> </{> Peter

Lougheed never threatened to take Alberta out of Confederation

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#45:1:C> Yeah but <@> Eliza </@> I would suggest that <,> that <}> <->

having <,> </-> <=> not waiting </=> </}> anymore to share wealth <,> with

the rest of the country not only Quebec but Newfoundland as well and New

Brunswick if you don't want to share your wealth <,> and <}> <-> this </->

<=> that </=> </}> goes with Ontario <,> as well maybe uhh you got to beg the

country more surely <,> <{> <[> than Bouchard </[> is going to do

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#46:1:B> <[> Alberta is </[> </{> Alberta's not going to give their oil

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#47:1:C> <[> Right right </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#48:1:B> It works both ways
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#49:1:B> <{1> <[1> So </[1> if you're going to talk that way about
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#50:1:B> <{2> <[2> one </[2> you have to talk that way about
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#51:1:B> <{3> <[3> the other </[3>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#52:1:C> <[1> Yes </[1> </{1>

<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#56:1:C> Why we Canadians <,,> we would have paid world price of our

<unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#57:1:C> That was the issue
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#58:1:C> Then Mister Trudeau was great <,> at explaining that being a

Canadian means sharing <}> <-> <.> kay </.> </-> <+> okay </+> </}>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#59:1:C> Uh so uhm ah in terms of economics <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}>

would say that some provinces are not very good Canadians <}> <-> in </-> <=>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#60:1:B> Good morning <@> Pam </@>

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#61:1:D> Good morning
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#62:1:D> I'd like to speak to Mister <{> <[> <@> Lafleur </@> </[>

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#65:1:D> Mister <@> Lafleur </@> I believe I heard you say earlier <,>

that Mister Parizeau brought the separatist vote to forty-nine point five

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#66:1:C> Or point four well <{> <[> yes </[>

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#67:1:D> <[> Or </[> </{> point four <{1> <[1> alright </[1>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#70:1:C> <[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#71:1:D> You said that

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#72:1:C> Yes
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#73:1:C> Well we now know that there has been some cheating involved
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#74:1:C> So <.> de </.> he didn't really bring it up to that point
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#75:1:C> That's what I'd like to tell you
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#76:1:C> Thank you

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#77:1:C> <}> <-> But </-> <=> but </=> </}> at the same time Madam the

Chief Electoral Officer said that uh the few thousand votes that had been

cheated well <,> uh it wouldn't cheat that much
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#78:1:C> Let's say that it was more than forty-nine anyway

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#79:1:B> <@> Mavis </@> good morning

<$E> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#80:1:E> Good morning <@> Eliza </@> and Monsieur <@> Lafleur </@>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#81:1:E> Monsieur <@> Lafleur </@> I know you are very articulate <,>

because I read you in French

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#82:1:C> Good

<$E> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#83:1:E> So therefore <,> would you please do me a favour <,> the whole

C J A D audience <,> and <,> the population of Quebec in general <,> to <,>

define for me one word <,> which will be I believe in my estimation give the

answer to <,> <}> <-> what does Quebec <}> <-> <.> nee </.> </-> <+> need

</+> </}> uh uh </-> <=> what does Quebec want </=> </}> if only he can

define for me in French with the French meaning of <}> <-> <mention> <indig>

distinct </indig> </mention> </-> <=> the adjective <mention> <indig>

distinct </indig> </mention> </=> </}> as in <mention> <indig>

soci&eacute;t&eacute; distinct </indig> </mention>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#84:1:C> Well two things <,> in one word what does Quebec want I would

say respect

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#85:1:B> Oh and Quebec doesn't have any respect

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#86:1:C> They don't feel <{1> <[1> look <@> Eliza </@> </[1> <}> <->

I'm </-> <=> I'm </=> </}> not the
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#87:1:C> <{2> <[2> spokesman </[2> for the whole Quebec

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#88:1:B> <[1> Oh they don't feel </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#89:1:B> <[2> I know </[2> </{2>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#90:1:C> <}> <-> But </-> <=> but </=> </}> they don't feel happy
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#91:1:C> But your question is very important madame
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#92:1:C> In my opinion we should get rid of the <mention> distinct society

</mention> vocabulary
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#93:1:C> I agree with you one hundred percent because <,> first of all it

was a bad <.> s </.> translation of <mention> distinct </mention>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#94:1:C> I suggested recently and maybe I leave <}> <-> <}> <-> you </-> <=>

your </=> </}> uh </-> <=> the people </=> </}> who listen to us with that

<?>

<$A> </?>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#95:1:A> <O> cough </O>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#96:1:C> In English <,,> Quebec is homeland of the French culture in

America <,> and I think everybody would agree with that
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#97:1:C> And at the United Nations homeland is always translated in French

by <mention> <indig> patrie </indig> </mention>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#98:1:C> Like the Palestinian uh uh <}> <-> they </-> <=> they </=> </}> say

it's homeland of Palestinians at the same time they say in French it's

<indig> patrie de palestiniens </indig>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#99:1:C> So why is it that we don't say <,> Quebec is homeland of the French

culture in America
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#100:1:C> <{> <[> I think it is acceptable </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#101:1:B> <[> Isn't that what the federal </[> </{> the federal

Liberals did a couple of weeks ago

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#102:1:C> Well they tried with <indig> foyer principal </indig> and

that

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#103:1:B> <}> <-> <.> Wha </.> </-> <=> what </=> </}> the heck is the

difference except they called it the fireplace but uh <,,>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#104:1:C> My point is uh <,> <mention> distinct society </mention> has

become a symbol in <{> <[> Quebec </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#105:1:B> <[> Yes </[> </{>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-035#106:1:C> If you want to get rid of it you've got to find a better word

<,> <}> <-> but </-> <=> but </=> </}> not different but better word
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#107:1:C> And <mention> <indig> patrie </indig> </mention> I suggest to you

is much better word <}> <-> than </-> <=> because </=> </}> there is

<mention> patriotism </mention> et cetera uh than <,> <indig> foyer principal

</indig> which as you know <}> <-> is </-> <=> leads </=> </}> to all sorts

of jokes
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#108:1:C> But I agree with the fundamental question <,> we should get rid of

<mention> distinct </mention>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#109:1:C> But I'm not the Prime Minister of Canada so uh <,> you know I'm

here to solve the problem but I <&> not " i'm" </&> here to give suggestions

<,> and I'm puzzled <}> <-> by <,> </-> <=> to know </=> </}> that presently

<,> today when we talk <,> there is still three premiers in English Canada I

won't give you the name still trying to push around to get <mention> distinct

society </mention> to be accepted
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#110:1:C> I think they are wasting their time
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#111:1:C> They're <}> <-> <.> ve </.> </-> <=> very </=> </}> respectable

person
<ICE-CAN:S1B-035#112:1:C> It's very nice what they tried to do for Quebec <,> but <,> I know

it won't wash because uh <}> <-> it </-> <=> it </=> </}> has become <,> and

as by the symbol in English Canada in that it is a good symbol <}> <-> in

Quebec </-> <=> in French Quebec </=> </}> so
