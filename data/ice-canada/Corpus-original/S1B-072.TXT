was much much bigger <,> so there were a lot of really <,> great plusses to

it

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#137:1:A> Uhm <,,> better in the sense that uhm <,> we felt uhm <,> it

was a more homey kind of atmosphere that <{1> <[1> we were going </[1> to be

moving to <{2> <[2> <,> although </[2> it was uhm <,> <}> <-> a </-> <=> a

</=> </}> duplex <,> uh that had been renovated

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#138:1:B> <[1> Uh huh </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#139:1:B> <[2> Mm </[2> </{2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#140:1:A> The other duplexes <,> in the area were all University

buildings

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#141:1:B> Mm hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#142:1:A> And so there was a degree of <,,> not commercialism but I

guess institutionalism <{1> <[1> <,> uhm </[1> on the street <{2> <[2> you

know </[2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#143:1:B> <[1> Mm hmm </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#144:1:B> <[2> Mm hmm </[2> </{2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#145:1:A> Uhm and it was a very short little space <,> so uhm <,> it

didn't have that homey feeling

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#146:1:B> Mm hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#147:1:A> And then we went up against opposition of uhm our local

residents of our new building <,> who did not want the daycare to be situated

on their street

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#148:1:B> <{> <[> Mm hmm </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#149:1:A> <[> Not </[> </{> In My Backyard syndrome <,> and uh

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#150:1:B> I just find that amazing <{> <[> for a daycare </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#151:1:A> <[> Mm hmm </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#152:1:B> I mean <}> <-> it's </-> <=> it's </=> </}> <,,>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#153:1:B> Well <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> just find it surprising

that people <}> <-> are </-> <=> are </=> </}> as uh <,> contrary to

<unclear> word </unclear> <}> <-> this </-> <=> this </=> </}> whole idea

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#154:1:B> <{> <[> It's hard
<ICE-CAN:S1B-072#155:1:B> It's </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#156:1:A> <[> Mm hmm mm hmm it is </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#157:1:B> We just hear on the news now about what's going on about the

daycare

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#158:1:A> Mm hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#159:1:A> Yeah there's one right now that uh I think one of the

Canadian uh <,> government officials wrote a letter on uh <,> government

stationary <{> <[> <unclear> word </unclear> uhm </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#160:1:B> <[> <O> laugh </O> yeah </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#161:1:A> Yeah <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> residents thought we

were <}> <-> gonna </-> <+> going to </+> </}> be ripping up and down the

streets with our cars dropping <{> <[> our children off </[> at all hours and

<,> you know

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#162:1:B> <[> Hmm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#163:1:A> Ah <}> <-> in </-> <=> in </=> </}> reality I <?> mean </?>

we've really blended <}> <-> into <{1> <[1> the </-> <=> into the </=> </}>

community </[1> quite nicely <}> <-> and </-> uhm <,,> <=> and </=> </}> <}>

<-> we've </-> <=> we've </=> </}> had some interesting uh <,> uh

get-togethers with the community and invited them to come and visit and we

had an open house and they could come in and <,> tour the <{2> <[2>

facilities and what not </[2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#164:1:B> <[1> I would think so </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#165:1:B> <[2> Mm hmm </[2> </{2>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#166:1:A> And I think that was a very positive experience <}> <-> and

</-> <=> and </=> </}> that might be something that we have to look <{> <[>

at

<$A> And </[> also uhm

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#167:1:B> <[> Mm hmm </[> </{>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#168:1:B> That's a good idea

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#169:1:A> So <}> <-> we tried to </-> <=> we tried to </=> </}> look at

it from the community's <{> <[> perspective </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#170:1:B> <[> Mm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#171:1:A> And we tried to look at it from the children's perspective

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#172:1:A> And then so well in advance we explained to the children that

the building was going to be <,> taken down <,> uhm but it was for a positive

step because they were going to be building a new high school and it was

really important for <,> the boys of this particular school to have the space

that they needed
<ICE-CAN:S1B-072#173:1:A> And <,> so we tried to encourage them to understand <,> uhm the

process a little bit more

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#174:1:B> Mm hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#175:1:A> So that when they saw <}> <-> the being </-> <=> the building

being </=> </}> torn down <,> if <,> it came to that <,> that none of them

would be frightened

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#176:1:B> Mm hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#177:1:A> And so we had to prepare the children <,> and we had to

prepare the community that we were moving into and we had to prepare the

parents <,> of the children <}> <-> who <,> were also </-> <=> whose lives

were also </=> </}> being affected by <{> <[> all of this </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#178:1:B> <[> How did you affect </[> </{> the community

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#179:1:A> How <{> <[> did we </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#180:1:B> <[> How did you </[> </{> let them know to take away some of

that <,> anxiety that they had

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#181:1:A> Uhm probably uhm <,> uh <}> <-> <.> th </.> the </-> uh <=>

the </=> </}> most uhm <,> difficult thing to do actually was to have a

meeting with the community
<ICE-CAN:S1B-072#182:1:A> We invited <,> uhm everyone on the street <,> to come <,> and uh

meet with us
<ICE-CAN:S1B-072#183:1:A> And it was a somewhat antagonistic uh <,> meeting

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#184:1:B> Mm hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#185:1:A> Uhm a lot of people came <}> <-> with </-> <=> with </=> </}>

uh padded agendas <{> <[> and </[> lists of complaints and <,> ideas

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#186:1:B> <[> Mm hmm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#187:1:A> And <,> what we did was that we <,> basically just tried to

handle the questions one on one <,> uhm <,,> gently <,,> uh and <}> <-> with

a </-> <=> with uh a </=> <-> a </-> </}> <,> strong degree of tact <{> <[>

<}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#188:1:B> <[> Mm hmm mm hmm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#189:1:A> Uh <.> e </.> <}> <-> we tried to </-> uhm <,,> <=> we tried

to </=> </}> impress upon them that we were of a cooperative nature and so if

there was something that <,> they were really opposed to that we didn't feel

was something absolutely necessary then we <,> were <.> c </.> going to

accommodate them

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#190:1:B> Mm hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#191:1:A> Uhm so <,> what we did was <,> they were very concerned about

us driving up and down the street so we agreed that we would not use the

front doors <,> of the building

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#192:1:A> And we designed the building so that people would have to

come through the campus <,> and park on the campus <,> parking <{1> <[1> lot

facilities <,> and come </[1> in through the back door <,> to eliminate <.> s

</.> the additional stress on the street <{2> <[2> that they thought </[2>

that they were going to have

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#193:1:B> <[1> Oh oh </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-072#194:1:B> <[2> Mm </[2> </{2> </I>
