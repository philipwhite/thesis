<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#1:1> <h> <bold> Nonsense on the economy </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#2:1> Professor Ruben Bellan had some comments in the <it> Winnipeg Free

Press </it> on October 28 comparing the problem of the GST to the problem of

our deficit. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#3:1> Professor Bellan based his entire letter on two assumptions that

sound good in theory, but are not realistic alternatives.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#4:1> He stated that we did not have to worry about the size of our deficit

( and I assume he implies the size of our debt) because a government can

always raise money to pay it back.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#5:1> First of all, they can raise taxes and, secondly, they have the right

to simply print money to pay debt. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#6:1> Professor Bellan fails to consider what happens if the government

chooses either of those courses of action.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#7:1> If the government raises taxes, who do you think will pay them?
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#8:1> Most of us who have wit <l> nessed the workings of government for any

length of time will realize that they will be dipping into our pocketbook.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#9:1> How much more can they raise income taxes before peo <l> ple will

simply revolt? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#10:1> If they attempt to tax something other than income, for example

con <l> sumption, then look at the hue and cry in the country because of the

GST.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#11:1> Professor Bellan fails to men <l> tion that taxes must be paid by

somebody, and that somebody will be us.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#12:1> The imposition of the amount of tax that will be required will

substantially affect our lifestyle. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#13:1> Mr. Bellan also suggests that a government can simply print more

money when it needs to pay debt.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#14:1> What he neglects to mention is that if a government does just that,

they run the very real risk of serious inflation. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#15:1> If you double the amount of money in the country, then you have

more money chasing fewer goods, and this causes prices to spiral upwards.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#16:1> In some countries they have spiralled totally out of control.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#17:1> How would you feel about the state of our economy if the price of

milk doubled every month? </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#18:1> Professor Bellan does a disservice to ordinary Canadians by

spouting such economic nonsense.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#19:1> It is no doubt true that a government is very different from the rest

of us because it can impose any sort of tax it wishes, and it can print as

much money as it needs to pay its bills.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#20:1> If a government chooses either of those courses of action and acts

irrespon <l> sibly, it could bring Canada's econ <l> omy to its knees. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#21:1> Professor Bellan has said that we don't have a problem because

the government can take some action.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#22:1> He has failed to consider the disas <l> trous consequences of that

action, and his letter is deliberately mis <l> leading. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#23:1> It was rather ironic that the same paper also contained an

article enti <l> tled <it> Getting out of the Debt Trap </it> and the basic

point of that article was that Canadians have too much individual debt and

cannot get out of it.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#24:1> Professor Bellan attempted to make the point that a government was

very different from a business, and I would assume he would draw the same

distinction between the government and an individual.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#25:1> I do not agree.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#26:1> Our government has the same problem as the individuals referred to in

the latter article. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#27:1> We as a country have been living beyond our means for years.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#28:1> I have heard statistics that we have the highest debt per person in

the entire world.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#29:1> We have paid for our present lifestyle by racking up huge irre <l>

sponsible debts.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#30:1> Sooner or later we will have to pay the price of that debt, and when

we do, it will not be pleasant.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#31:1> Economists such as Pro <l> fessor Bellan must be looking for the

downfall of our present system if they advocate such economic non <l> sense.

<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#34:2> <h> <bold> Children's basic needs denied </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#35:2> I read with dismay your No <l> vember 2 headline, <it> Agency

failed family in fatal tragedy, judge says </it> </p> .

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#36:2> In his deliberations Judge Winston Norton concluded that the

killings of Mary Ann, Bradley and Jimmy Reid by their father Raymond and his

own subsequent suicide, occurred as a result of Child and Family Ser <l>

vices <quote> " not being equipped to handle the problems with which it is

faced." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#37:2> By implication the judge attributes this tragedy to the incompetence

of social services agencies and in so doing he advances the provincial

government's harmful indifference towards the hundreds of children whose

lives are in jeopardy as a result of family violence. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#38:2> In response to the Reid killings, Family Services Minister Harold

Gilleshammer defended his depart <l> ment by stating that budgets have

increased substantially over recent years.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#39:2> This transparent rhetoric does not, of course, speak to the critical

issue of whether adequate funds were allocated in the first place.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#40:2> Furthermore it is quite mis <l> leading. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#41:2> The basic foster rate has been increased but this is a direct

bill-through which does not affect the funding to the Child and Family

Services agencies.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#42:2> In fact, their bud <l> gets have been dramatically les <l> sened

resulting in the cutback of vital and often life-preserving ser <l> vices to

children.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#43:2> The magnitude of the problem of child abuse in Mani <l> toba is

indeed overwhelming and preventive services are virtually non-existent. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#44:2> One of the few agencies providing such services is the Community

Re <l> source Clinic, 321 McDermot Ave <l> nue, which opened in the aftermath

of the Reid killings.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#45:2> Staffed by facul <l> ty and students from both Social Work and

Psychology departments at the University of Manitoba, these individuals work

extremely hard in their attempt to manage a burgeon <l> ing high-risk

caseload.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#46:2> The clinic's backlog is an ever-present reminder of government's

inadequate provi <l> sion of these essential services. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#47:2> When disaster strikes, as it did with the Reid killings, blaming

Child and Family Services agencies for ineffective action is specious; it may

also serve to promote harm.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#48:2> New and inexperienced social workers constitute the cheap labor

option which this government wilfully ex <l> ploits.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#49:2> Often these individuals carry up to 50 cases each; they are relent

<l> lessly overworked and poorly paid. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#50:2> The prevention of such horrors as the Reid killings has to be a

fiscal priority in any just society.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#51:2> We rely upon government to uphold the prin <l> ciple of distributive

justice through the macroallocation of resources.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#52:2> Nothing exotic is being requested here, simply the provision of ade

<l> quate food, shelter, and safety.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#53:2> Given the current state of affairs, children's basic needs are being

denied for reasons for which they can not be held responsible, namely their

powerlessness and the fact that life's lottery has rendered them dis <l>

advantaged by birth. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#54:2> The words and deeds of Manito <l> ba's Department of Family

Services send a clear message to the elector <l> ate.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#55:2> Our intention is to recede fur <l> ther from our moral obligation to

address the agonies of children in life-threatening circumstances.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#56:2> The ramifications of this posture are too awful to contemplate. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#61:3> Recently Prime Minister Mulron <l> ey co-chaired the World Summit

on Children. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#62:3> Subsequently, the federal govern <l> ment has announced the

appoint <l> ment of the Minister of Nation <l> al Health and Welfare as the

minister for children's issues and the creation within that department of a

children's bureau. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#63:3> Whilst some commentary on these announcements has been critical,

we believe it is important to recognize the potential benefits to children of

creating this responsibility centre within the federal government. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#64:3> The Canadian Council on Children and Youth has long advocated

such a centre to provide co-ordination of various government departments and

to ensure that policy decisions in any department which impact on children

will recognize that impact. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#65:3> It is also important to note that these announcements demonstrate

implementation of the first two rec <l> ommendations of the Report on Child

Sexual Abuse of the Special Policy Adviser on this subject, Rix Rogers (

Reaching for Solutions). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#66:3> Child sexual abuse and child pov <l> erty represent two of the

most common urgent problems which must be dealt with if Canada's chil <l>

dren are to have acceptable lives as they grow and develop into adults. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#67:3> The next step should be the early announcement of the leadership

and staffing of the bureau together with a budget appropriate to its complex

tasks. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#68:3> Strong leadership, extensive ex <l> pertise and an appropriate

budget for the bureau will help establish its credibility and demonstrate

that the federal government's commitment to children is real and ongoing.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#69:3> It is easy to dismiss such an <l> nouncements as having little

signifi <l> cance for Canada's million poor children or many abused children.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#70:3> But it is through the creation of a structure to deal with those prob

<l> lems that the federal government may finally be able to come to grips

with these issues. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#71:3> Those of us who care for Canada's children and advocate for

solutions to their problems should at least be ready to applaud these signs

of the government's interest in children and to encourage the federal govern

<l> ment to translate that interest into the implementation of policies which

will actually serve the needs of those children. </p>

<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#74:4> <h> <bold> <it> Loyal fans subject to shabby treatment on arena

question </it> </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#75:4> After seeing my first Winnipeg <w> Jets' </w> game last month

when the Boston Bruins were in town, I left the arena somewhat shocked and

confused.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#76:4> I was stunned.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#77:4> The arena was clean, the view was good, and the fans were knowl <l>

edgeable and polite. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#78:4> For the past five years, my family and I have lived in Boston,

and on more than one occasion have ventured into the less than friendly

confines of the Garden.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#79:4> Suffice it to say the Garden is a literal trash heap compared to the

Winnipeg Arena.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#80:4> It would be fair to say that the Bruin faithful would kill to have a

home rink as nice as the Winnipeg Arena, compared to the vulgarity, obscene

gestures and the stench of stale beer at the Garden. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#81:4> Another interesting point is that the owners of the Garden and

the Bruins - The Deleware North Corporation - have promised ei <l> ther a new

Garden or at least a refurbished one.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#82:4> They made this promise six years ago, and I really doubt if a new

facility will be erected for at least another five years. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#83:4> Keep in mind that they did not demand anything from the City of

Boston, and that this situation is made more complicat <l> ed by the Garden

also being part of a major train and trolley hub called North Station.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#84:4> Whether a new arena in Boston is developed or not is beside the

point, it is preposterous to entertain ideas of the Bruins playing anywhere

but Boston. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#85:4> In the same vein, it would be ludicrous for the Jets to be any

<l> where but Winnipeg.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#86:4> The all-or-nothing arena issue that has been presented by Jets

management is not fair to the fans who have supported the Jets since their

con <l> ception.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#87:4> Now, I am sure that I do not fully understand the situation, but a

compromise of some degree should be entertained.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#88:4> Further <l> more, the citizens of this city deserve better than this

shabby treatment from an organization that they have been loyal to for many

years. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#89:4> Everyone realizes that the addi <l> tion of private boxes in a

new arena would be lucrative and de <l> sirable but, until the Jets and their

management establish a proven track record of success, only then should a new

building be deve <l> loped. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#90:4> It's funny, but if any franchise is deserving of a new building

it is the Bruins.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#91:4> The Garden supports two major franchises and count <l> less college /

university events.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#92:4> This place is filthy, the fans are extremely rude and the building is

beginning to decay.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#93:4> This is not to mention the occasional Green Line rodent that wants to

mingle with the fans. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#94:4> The fans of the Bruins and the Celtics flock to this place in

droves and usually sell the place out.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#95:4> The reason is obviously not the Gar <l> den.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#96:4> The Bruins work extremely hard game in and out, and play a fairly

decent brand of hockey. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2E-009#97:4> As for the Jets and the Winnipeg Arena, things could be much

worse.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#98:4> The arena is a clean facili <l> ty, it is comfortable and a nice

place to watch a game.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#99:4> Even with their slow start, the Jets seem to be on the threshold of

greatness.
<ICE-CAN:W2E-009#100:4> It may not happen this year, and I doubt if it will without the

addition of a scorer or two. <O> rest of paragraph </O> </p> </I>
