CONGRESSES IN CANADA </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-005#2:1> <h> <bold> Objectives </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-005#3:1> The purpose of this program is to encourage and facilitate the

communication of research, within and between disciplines, among Canadian

researchers, international experts and foreign researchers through occasional

regional and national conferences, workshops, symposia and colloquia, as well

as through congresses of major international scholarly associations held in

Canada. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-005#4:1> <h> <bold> Description </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-005#5:1> Grants are offered to help defray the costs of organizing

conferences ( including workshops, symposia and colloquia) and congresses.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-005#6:1> This includes administrative costs, travel and subsistence costs of

some participants ( but not honoraria), and the publication of conference or

congress proceedings.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-005#7:1> For the purposes of this program, the term congress is defined as the

formal, periodic meeting of an international learned society which includes

both a business and scholarly component.

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-005#8:1> The maximum value and duration of a grant is: - &dollar;10,000 for

up to one year for a conference - &dollar;50,000 for up to three years for a

congress. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-005#9:1> Two competitions are held each year.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-005#10:1> The actual amount of the grant depends on the merit of the

application, the financial need and the appropriateness of the proposed

budget. </p>

association funded under SSHRC's Aid and Attendance Grants to Scholarly

Associations program, and which will coincide with that association's annual

general meeting, is eligible only if the organizers can demonstrate: - that

the conference is a distinct, independent and self-contained event - that it

will address an audience which is different from or broader than that of the

annual general meeting. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-005#15:1> For a <it> congress </it> to be eligible, it must: &bullet; take

place in Canada after the date specified for SSHRC's announcement of

competition results &bullet; include a fully constituted business meeting of

its members &bullet; have a defined research theme in areas within the

association's purview &bullet; be sponsored by an association which: — has as

its main objective the furthering of advanced scholarly research in a

discipline of the social sciences or the humanities; — shows evidence of a

membership with broad international representation ( a minimum of three

countries). </p>
