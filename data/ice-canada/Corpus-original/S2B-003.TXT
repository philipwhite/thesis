<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-003#87:2:A> Canada at five
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#88:2:A> Good afternoon
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#89:2:A> I'm <@> Margaret Jones </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#90:2:A> The minister of justice is not backing down on the issue of gun

registration
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#91:2:A> Over the past few weeks there has been a lot of pressure on Allan

Rock to drop the compulsory registration of all firearms from his gun control

bill
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#92:2:A> Several provinces' gun organizations and the Canadian Medical

Association have said registration will not cut down on deaths or injuries

from firearms
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#93:2:A> They argue the money the government will spend on gun registration

should go to other areas of crime control
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#94:2:A> <@> Brian Johnson </@> of the Reform Party made the same argument

in the House of Commons as he questioned Rock about the gun bill

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-003#95:2:B> Registration will do nothing to curb crime
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#96:2:B> Why doesn't he scrap that whole idea <,> and save the taxpayers a

lot of dollars

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S2B-003#97:2:C> If I were to do such a thing <,,> I would disappoint the

strongest supporters of registration
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#98:2:C> The chiefs of police of this country
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#99:2:C> The front-line police officers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#100:2:C> The Canadian Police Association
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#101:2:C> The mayors of cities
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#102:2:C> The professional health care workers
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#103:2:C> People who know Mr Speaker <&> Speaker of the House of Commons

</&> of the close the practical and the demonstrable connection between

registration of firearms and achieving greater public safety <O> background

cheering </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-003#104:2:A> Rock also denies charges by native groups that the gun

control bill would violate treaty rights
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#105:2:A> The first witness could be called sooner than expected in the Paul

Bernardo murder trial
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#106:2:A> Bernardo is charged with the sexual assault and murder of two

teenaged girls
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#107:2:A> He has pleaded not guilty to all charges
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#108:2:A> Bernardo's file has been marked by numerous delays but last week

lawyers managed to finish some arguments ahead of schedule
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#109:2:A> The judge had said he was willing to start hearing testimony early

if the jury could be rounded up
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#110:2:A> As <@> Scott Bergen </@> reports that's exactly what court staff

did

<$D> <ICE-CAN:S2B-003#111:2:D> The jurors for this trial were picked earlier this month
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#112:2:D> But as soon as the twelve were in place they were told to go home

for two weeks
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#113:2:D> In the interim lawyers for both sides would argue over what

evidence could be presented in the trial
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#114:2:D> Uncharacteristically the lawyers got through those arguments a lot

quicker than expected
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#115:2:D> So the judge proposed calling the jury back early
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#116:2:D> On Friday afternoon and over the weekend court staff managed to

track down the jurors
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#117:2:D> And as it turned out they were all available to be back in court

ahead of schedule
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#118:2:D> So on Thursday the crown attorney will lay out his case before the

jury
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#119:2:D> He'll explain what evidence he intends to produce against Bernardo

and sometime later in the day he'll call his first witness
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#120:2:D> Much of the detail of this case has been under court-ordered wraps

for more than two years
<ICE-CAN:S2B-003#121:2:D> But starting Thursday as the case is presented in open court

reporters will finally be able to start telling at least some of the Bernardo

story

otherwise <,> uh forget it

seen as playing a very useful role at the margin in uh in expanding the

availability of capital
