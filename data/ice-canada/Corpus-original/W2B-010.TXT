<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#1:2> <h> Bach to Basics </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#2:2> <h> Tafelmusik is true to the original </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#3:2> Those who still think that <mention> " early music" </mention>

means dry, fussy performances on scratchy, <w> out-of-tune </w> instruments

need only hear a Tafelmusik performance to understand how compelling period

instruments can be.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#4:2> Interest in " how Bach would have heard it" is only part of the reason

why musicians like those in Tafelmusik, Toronto's baroque orchestra on period

instru <l> ments, have spent so much time and energy mastering the

intricacies of the old instruments and why their annual audience of 50,000

keeps coming back for more. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#5:2> The music of the 17th and 18th centuries was written to be played

on instruments constructed quite differently from those normally used today.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#6:2> In the hands of accom <l> plished players these instruments almost

always make for naturally convincing performances, especially in terms of

balance and tonal blend.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#7:2> This is because they produce differ <l> ent sounds than those of

modern orchestral instruments: lighter and less imposing sounds, which are

also more subtle and colourful. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#8:2> Now that period-instrument en <l> sembles are firmly established

in the musical life of Europe and North America, all that groups like Tafel

<l> musik ask of a new audience member is that he or she take the performance

on its own terms and ask themselves: is the music pleasing or not?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#9:2> More and more, concert-goers who never expected to be captivated by

such a seemingly eso <l> teric approach are saying that it is very pleasing

indeed. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#10:2> In fact, once settled into the red cushions at Toronto's

Trinity-St. Paul United Church, audience mem <l> bers find it hard not to be

pleased.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#11:2> The warmth of the surroundings matches the warmth of the ensemble

onstage; there is no mistaking the fact that the musicians are having fun.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#12:2> Since the ensemble normally has no conductor ( music director Jean

Lamon directs from her place at the head of the first violins), the players

must relate to one another as they would when performing chamber music.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#13:2> The resulting in <l> volvement in the music is height <l> ened by the

fact that in most of Tafelmusik's repertoire each mem <l> ber of the ensemble

is frequently allowed - even expected - to impro <l> vise ornamentation and

new melodic lines. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#14:2> Tafelmusik is now enter <l> ing its second decade with all the

energy and ambition that it had in its very first season eleven years ago.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#15:2> Although the orchestra is larger and many of its members have

changed, the drive to be the best and to show the world what it can do has

remained constant.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#16:2> In the beginning the ensemble - founders Ken Solway ( baroque oboe)

and Susan Graves ( baroque bassoon) with friends they gathered together -

were happy to play in whatever venues they could find.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#17:2> The move to Trinity-St. Paul in the orchestras third season brought

some stability to the ensemble, although the building seemed to mirror the

group's situation: full of spirit but a little ragged at the edges. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#18:2> The church's fortunes have im <l> proved with those of the

orchestra and now shining wooden staircases, long pews with red seat cushions

and a refurbished 'backstage' area all reflect the polish and success which

have come to Tafelmusik in the last few years under Jean Lamon's leadership.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#19:2> Where once the orchestra had to work hard to half fill their halls,

they now present each subscription concert two and sometimes three times.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#20:2> Run-out appearances around southern On <l> tario have turned into

world-wide tours to some of music's most pres <l> tigious centres.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#21:2> Most important, those heartfelt but sometimes scrappy early

appearances have become thoroughly accomplished, energetic performances by up

to 23 people as Tafelmusik's repertoire has expanded beyond the baroque to

include the symphonies of Haydn and his contemporaries. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#22:2> Of great importance is the fact that the core group of twelve

string players and one harpsichordist receives a full-time salary and is able

to devote its entire attention to the ensemble, unlike most period-instrument

orchestras.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#23:2> In fact, San Francisco's Philhar <l> monia is the only other North

Ameri <l> can baroque orches <l> tra that can afford to operate this way.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#24:2> The schedule for Tafelmusik's current season shows the variety

and careful planning which has always been the group's hallmark under the

direction of long-time general manager Ottie Lockey.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#25:2> Guest solo <l> ists include both world-famous per <l> formers such as

the conductor and harpsichordist Ton Koopman, besides less well known artists

- like soprano Ann Monoyios - who are nonetheless first class musicians. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#26:2> This season's programs include old favourites ( one of Bach's

Bran <l> denburg Concertos) as well as more unusual repertoire ( a concert

presentation of Handel's opera <it> Floridante </it> ) and a performance of

one of the greatest and most difficult masterpieces of the Baroque, Bach's

<it> Mass in B minor </it> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#27:2> Tafelmusik continued its tradi <l> tional heavy touring schedule

with a visit to several American music festivals in November 1989.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#28:2> They embarked on a cross-Canada tour in January and, to cap the

season, a three-week European tour ( the or <l> chestra's fifth) in June.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#29:2> As well, a ground-breaking trip to the Far East is planned for next

November. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#30:2> These tours are important to the orchestra not only in financial

terms ( unlike larger and more unwieldy ensembles, Tafelmusik's touring helps

pay the bills for its home-town concert series).
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#31:2> They also bring the somewhat specialized world of period-instrument

performance to communities that would otherwise have little access to such

music-making. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#32:2> Tafelmusik's recent agree <l> ment to record for the

international BMG ( formerly RCA) group on the Deutsche Harmonia Mundi label

gives the orchestra the oppor <l> tunity to reach thousands of new listeners

all over the world.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#33:2> The infectious nature of the orchestra's live performances comes

through on their first two recordings for BMG, six Concerti Grossi by

Arcangelo Corelli and Concerti and Symphonies by Luigi Boccherini with Dutch

cello soloist Anner Bylsma. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#34:2> Critical reaction to these discs has been very favour <l> able.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#35:2> Tess Knighton in <it> Gramophone </it> magazine comments that in the

Corelli performances <quote> " virtuosity and vital <l> ity are both present

in generous quantities" </quote> and chooses the album as one of the best of

the year, while Nils Anderson in <it> Fanfare </it> enthuses that the disc is

<quote> " a joy from beginning to end" </quote> and that <quote> " the [

recorded] sound is broad and clean with fine ambience" </quote> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#36:2> With the release of these record <l> ings, almost anyone can now

have easy access to Tafelmusik, whether in concert at Trinity-St. Paul, on

tour - or at home in front of the stereo. </p> </I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#42:3> She stood up and began jogging up and down the room.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#43:3> <quote> " Like this," </quote> she said.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#44:3> She let her wrists go limp and her arms fly about.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#45:3> Inside her white robe other parts of that marvellous body jiggled and

jounced around.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#46:3> I was so totally stunned by all this activity I didn't even think to

raise my camera.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#47:3> I realized later that it would have been useless.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#48:3> I would have needed a motion-picture camera to record this memorable

performance.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#49:3> In slow motion. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#50:3> Marilyn returned to her mirror.

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#57:3> Marilyn stopped putting on her make-up and stared quietly out the

window for a good five minutes.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#58:3> She had apparently been thinking about her childhood, for somewhat

irrelevantly she asked, <quote> " Was it Freud who said that parents are the

psychological murderers of their children?" </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#59:3> Marilyn's childhood had been an unhappy one: a father who

disappeared before she was born; a mother she barely knew, who was

hospitalized for mental illness; an orphanage; a series of foster homes, one

run by religious fanatics and another where she was molested by an elderly

boarder who gave her a nickel " not to tell".
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#60:3> When she told, she was punished - for telling a lie. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#61:3> Today, Marilyn chose to dwell on some of the happier moments.

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#63:3> She returned to her make-up, applying eye shadow to the top of

her eyelids and soft pastel lipstick from a small jar.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#64:3> She fastened on false eyelashes, half-length, extending from the

middle of her eyes to the outer edge. </p> <O> three paragraphs: long quotes

</O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#65:3> As I was making notes, Marilyn said, <quote> " I'll just give you

the last verse of one.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#66:3> The rest is too personal. </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#67:3> She recited: <X> <it> O, Time Be Kind. Help this weary being To

forget what is sad to remember. Loose my loneliness, Ease my mind, While you

eat my flesh. </it> </X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#68:3> It was my turn to fall silent. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#69:3> Marilyn finished her make-up and disappeared into the bath <l>

room to shed her white robe.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#70:3> She reappeared in slacks and a low-cut red blouse that buttoned up

the back, but was undone. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#71:3> Turning around, she said, <quote> " Do me up the back." <quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#72:3> This I managed, with some fumbling. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#73:3> Marilyn propped herself up on her bed.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#74:3> <quote> " I know what," </quote> she said, <quote> " I have to learn

to smoke a cigarette for my next picture.

the other with my tongue." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#78:3> She ran through pose after pose and I shot off a whole roll of

film.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#79:3> For the final picture she leaned for <l> ward directly into the

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#80:3> As we finished, there was a knock at the door.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#81:3> I opened it and found Frank Neill in an excited state.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#82:3> He looked at my cameras and before entering he muttered to me in an

aside, <quote> " Boss, we got a big deal going.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#83:3> Don't screw this up." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#84:3> Having no intention of screwing anything up, I retreated to a chair

in the corner of the room. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#85:3> Alive with excitement, Neill turned to Marilyn.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#86:3> <quote> " Honey, we got a real good break. <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#X87:3> Hy Gardner wants to use you on his coast-to-coast show tonight.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#90:3> <quote> " All right, Butterball," </quote> said Marilyn.

<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#93:3> <quote> <X> " Fine, honey." </quote> </X> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#94:3> Neill picked up her phone and sat down on the bed beside her.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#95:3> It took some time for Neill to get through to New York and the

connection was ap <l> parently not very good because eventually he was

shouting. </p> <O> paragraph: one-way phone conversation </O>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#96:3> Neill put his hand over the mouthpiece.

hottest thing in New York - " </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#98:3> <quote> " I don't care, Butterball," </quote> said Marilyn.

<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#179:3> Neill suggested this would make a good photo. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#180:3> <quote> " I'd like to take a look through them," <quote> said

Marilyn, <quote> " but no photos.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#181:3> <X> That's corny.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#X182:3> Like in New York they say, 'Look up at the skyscrapers.'
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#X183:3> Do they think you've never seen a skyscraper be <l> fore?
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#X184:3> I like pictures that have some warmth, some human quali <l> ty to

them." </X> </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2B-010#185:3> After Marilyn had peered at the Falls, we continued our stroll

until we came to a poster advertising the <it> Maid of the Mist </it> boat

ride.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#186:3> On the spur of the moment, Marilyn announced that she wanted to make

the boat trip.
<ICE-CAN:W2B-010#187:3> Neill said he had another appoint <l> ment and he left Marilyn and

me to make our way down to the <it> Maid of the Mist </it> landing at the

river's edge. </p> </I>
