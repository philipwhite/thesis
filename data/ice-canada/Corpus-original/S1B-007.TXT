<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-007#297:1:C> I'm having a blast

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-007#298:1:A> Yeah

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-007#299:1:C> Today we were scientists

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-007#300:1:A> How was the birdwatching unit

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-007#301:1:C> Oh great
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#302:1:C> We did an experiment today <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#303:1:C> And uh <,> I was teaching them how ducks are waterproof and <,>

they don't get wet
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#304:1:C> And I have this <{> <[> <?> book </?> called </[> Ducks Don't Get

Wet <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#305:1:C> And there's a little experiment <,> in the book

<$F> <ICE-CAN:S1B-007#306:1:F> <[> <unclear> mumbled one or two words </unclear> </[> </{>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-007#307:1:C> So what I did at first I mixed uhm <,> ah <}> <-> <.> gree

</.> </-> <+> green </+> </}> ah <,,> pff blue <,> water with <,> yellow

water
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#308:1:C> And I told them I said <,> what do you think will happen if I <,>

blend these two together
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#309:1:C> Will they mix
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#310:1:C> Will I get like <,> blue <,> and yellow and they're like no you'll

get green you silly <&> others laugh </&>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-007#311:1:C> Like <?> they're saying </?> silly but they were looking at

me as if I'm stupid <&> others laugh </&>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-007#312:1:C> So we did that I said okay our predictions were good and I

was telling them that scientists make predictions and <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#313:1:C> So I said well here I have <,> another bottle <,> of water and

they said put red red so I <,> put in red dye <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#314:1:C> And then uhm <,> I had oil <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#315:1:C> I said this is oil
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#316:1:C> Feel it and we're all touching the oil and <}> <-> we all like

</-> <=> we all like </=> </}> greasy hands and <,> I said do you think the

water and the oil will mix
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#317:1:C> Oh yes yes yes
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#318:1:C> I said you sure like <,> you won't get water and then a strip of

<,> oil and
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#319:1:C> So <}> <-> we made </-> <=> I had </=> </}> a prediction sheet and

I ticked off we said yes they all said yes <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#320:1:C> And then <,> I said nobody's saying no you know
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#321:1:C> So I didn't put my no I just left it like that <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#322:1:C> And then <,> course it <,> didn't mix and then I read them the

book and <,> they had to uh draw oh I've got it with me <O> laugh </O> I'm so

proud of it <&> others laugh </&>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-007#323:1:C> Well I photocopy everything they do in their bird journal

right <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#324:1:C> And so they had to draw <,> the experiment
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#325:1:C> Ducks don't get wet because their feathers are covered with oil
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#326:1:C> We did a science experiment and discovered that water and oil do

not mix <,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-007#327:1:A> Isn't that <{> <[> nice </[>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-007#328:1:C> <[> Mm <,> </[> </{> and uh <,> of course I had this made up

<O> others laughter starts </O> before the experiment <O> others laughter

ends </O>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#329:1:C> And then this is my picture of our science <,> experiment
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#330:1:C> The photocopier <}> <-> kinda </-> <+> kind of </+> </}> cut it

off
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#331:1:C> So I had the bottle on the table and they just sat around in a

circle <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#332:1:C> Just <{> <[> drawing the bottle </[> and <,>

<$F> <ICE-CAN:S1B-007#333:1:F> <[> That's <?> neat </?> </[> </{>

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S1B-007#334:1:C> So <,> that was <,> <{> <[> really fun </[>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-007#335:1:A> <[> Let's </[> </{> see the journal

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-007#336:1:A> That's cute

<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#338:1:C> That's <?> mine </?>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#339:1:C> This is a math one that I did
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#340:1:C> <,> They just had to <,> count and then write how many

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-007#341:1:A> <}> <-> <.> Y </.> </-> <+> You </+> </}> know what
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#342:1:A> You can take <,> these <{> <[> ideas </[> and use <{> <[> them

<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#348:1:C> Yeah
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#349:1:C> And then <,,> oh yes <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#350:1:C> If I could be <,> a bird I would be a <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#351:1:C> He said a blue jay and
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#352:1:C> He told me

because I like <?> bluejays </?> so I <,> wrote it for him
<ICE-CAN:S1B-007#354:1:C> And then this is another one <,> where <}> <-> they all </-> <=>

each child </=> </}> had a strip of ten birds

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-007#355:1:A> Mm hmm
