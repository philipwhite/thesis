<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-039#1:1:A> Their children come down
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#2:1:A> And smaller communities they're still <,> not actively encouraged to

come
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#3:1:A> And in some places they're still kind of <,> discouraged to leave
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#4:1:A> Cos they don't want them to leave
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#5:1:A> Cos the theory is that if they go they won't come back or if they do

come back they're not going to be <,> <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#6:1:A> It depends on how they come back
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#7:1:A> If they come back after a year depressed and demoralized cos they

couldn't stand it <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#8:1:A> Which is highly likely
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#9:1:A> You're coming from a village of a hundred and twenty people and you

come to this <O> laugh </O> you know like
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#10:1:A> This is a big shock
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#11:1:A> Uhm <}> <-> then </-> <=> then </=> </}> they come back to the

village <}> <-> and <.> th </.> </-> <=> and they </=> </}> don't know what

to do with themselves
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#12:1:A> They don't know how to fit in <,> cos they know that they don't fit
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#13:1:A> There's nothing for them to do anyway <}> <-> and and </-> <=> and

</=> </}> they've gone to the south and they've failed or it hasn't gone

overly well so what do they do
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#14:1:A> Or if they come back here and they do well <,> they get jobs down

here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#15:1:A> You know especially if it's in something that isn't uhh a direct

service
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#16:1:A> Like <}> <-> if they you know they </-> <=> if someone </=> </}>

goes and studies art history <,> there's not a whole lot of museums to go get

a job as a curator at <O> laugh </O> anyway
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#17:1:A> So <}> <-> whaddya </-> <+> what do you </+> </}> do
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#18:1:A> You know like you can go work there's <}> <-> a uhm </-> <,> <=>

uhm a </=> </}> cultural institute there
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#19:1:A> We have

<$ZH> <ICE-CAN:S2A-039#20:1:Z> <O> someone comments </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-039#21:1:A> <O> laugh </O> But it's a museum and there have been

archaeological digs in the north and they found uhm uhh a lot of very

interesting artifacts
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#22:1:A> And that is something that is coming up and it would be nice to

have <,> Inuit doing those <,> excavations as opposed to southern

archaeologists coming up <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#23:1:A> Certainly they'll have <}> <-> more uh </-> <,,> <=> more </=> </}>

involvement in it but <,> other than that I mean how if you go into

archaeology and you're Inuit will you
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#24:1:A> The likelihood of you working <,> in the north is pretty slim so

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#25:1:A> You know you could become a lawyer or a doctor or something that's

something that could be useful to your community in <unclear> three words

</unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#26:1:A> But there are very very few
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#27:1:A> <}> <-> It hasn't </-> <=> There haven't </=> </}> been that many

graduates from university yet
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#28:1:A> It's just starting
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#29:1:A> The schoolboard is only uhm

<$ZI> <ICE-CAN:S2A-039#30:1:Z> I <}> <-> dunno </-> <+> don't know </+> </}> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#31:1:Z> Seventeen <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#32:1:Z> Seventeen years old
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#33:1:Z> Yeah no couldn't be

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-039#34:1:A> Eighteen now eighteen years old
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#35:1:A> And before that there were day schools federal day schools <}> <->

and in </-> <=> but in </=> </}> most cases they were sent to residential

schools
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#36:1:A> Now it doesn't
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#37:1:A> Everybody kind of cringes whenever we say that too cos it's oh my

God residential schools
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#38:1:A> They've just seen all those C B C movies
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#39:1:A> Uhm <,> for the most part I haven't heard any horror stories <,> of

things
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#40:1:A> It doesn't seem that they had the same problems that a lot of the

Indian children seem to have had at residential schools
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#41:1:A> That's not to say it didn't happen
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#42:1:A> I'm sure there are cases <}> <-> of of </-> <=> of </=> </}> abuse

and things that happened <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#43:1:A> But <,> per se like the people I've talked to who're the
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#44:1:A> Roughly people my age people in their thirties and forties they

went to residential school and very few of them have <,> bad experiences

apart from feeling lonely <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> very far away

from home and losing a lot of the cultural contact like all <}> <-> those

</-> <=> the </=> </}> traditional things that would have been taught to them

as young people in the community
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#45:1:A> They lost that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#46:1:A> They weren't there when that happened uhm so
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#47:1:A> So <}> <-> they </-> <=> they </=> </}> come back to the

communities and they integrate in their own ways and <}> <-> there's <.> cer

</.> </-> <=> there is a certain </=> </}> displacement of knowledge at a

certain level
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#48:1:A> <}> <-> <.> Th </.> <.> th </.> </-> <=> There's </=> </}> a lot of

things the elders know that nobody else knows anymore because they weren't

around <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#49:1:A> And it's not necessarily <unclear> two words </unclear> these guys

<O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#50:1:A> The two thousand <O> laugh </O> because a culture class can only do

so much
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#51:1:A> And unfortunately <,> uhm it's not always uhh organized as it could

be
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#52:1:A> And it's often communities <}> <-> don't have </-> <=> there won't

be </=> </}> anyone to teach for instance boys culture
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#53:1:A> Hunters are hunting and there's no one who's <}> <-> gonna </-> <+>

going to </+> </}> come in and teach so <,> uhm
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#54:1:A> <}> <-> <.> Th </.> <.> th </.> </-> <=> They </=> </}> want to

keep up the traditions on one hand but on the other hand it's really hard to

find people who <}> <-> are </-> <=> are </=> </}> willing to come and work

in the school and do that <,> uhm
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#55:1:A> So the people you get <,> are usually very good if they do but they

don't often stay very long
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#56:1:A> That's another thing is <}> <-> they're not they don't they don't

have </-> <=> they don't have </=> </}> our <,> I don't know <,> protestant

work ethic is the only term I can think of <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#57:1:A> <}> <-> Their </-> <=> Their </=> </}> lives up until forty years

ago <,> were <,> lives of survival
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#58:1:A> They weren't <,> living in houses they weren't <,> working <,> they

were <,> surviving
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#59:1:A> They were hunting and fishing <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}>

moving around wherever the hunting was good
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#60:1:A> And they were completely nomadic
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#61:1:A> There's uhm <,> one of my friends in Inukjuak she's I guess now she

must be over forty-two but at the time I remember she had just turned forty

and <}> <-> she </-> <=> she </=> </}> was the last person in the village

that was born out on the land <,> uhm so
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#62:1:A> But I mean to me it was fascinating that there was someone still

around that was born on the land you know that's a weird concept to me to

born out <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#63:1:A> And when they mean on the land they mean literally whoops here's

some moss this looks like a good spot <O> laughs with audience </O> you know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#64:1:A> This was on the land
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#65:1:A> And they <unclear> two words </unclear> I think it was winter I

can't remember <}> <-> <.> wh </.> </-> <=> how </=> </}> <unclear> two or

three words </unclear> <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#66:1:A> So they still have people who have very interesting memories of

living
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#67:1:A> A lot of them still remember <,> a time before houses the time

before central heating the time before running water the time before stores

<}> <-> and and and uh </-> <,> <=> and </=> </}> becoming used to

convenience foods
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#68:1:A> <unclear> Two words </unclear> Chuckwagon
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#69:1:A> It's this disgusting sandwich thing that you stick it in the

microwave to heat up
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#70:1:A> If you ask your students what did you have for lunch ninety percent

of them will say Chuckwagon
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#71:1:A> Took me a long time to find out what chuckwagon <O> sob </O> <O>

sniff </O> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#72:1:A> Wasn't anything I ever
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#73:1:A> You know you kind of expect peanut butter sandwich or something
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#74:1:A> No Chuckwagon <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#75:1:A> If anything
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#76:1:A> Uhm and still a lot of <}> <-> their </-> <=> their </=> </}> what

is it uhm living or their <unclear> word </unclear>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#77:1:A> The children are allowed to do <}> <-> what uhh </-> <=> as they

please </=> </}> <,> pretty much
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#78:1:A> If they want to stay up till three in the morning on a school night

they do
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#79:1:A> And it's not that they're not looked after really it's just that

they're treated in a different way and it's up to the child to go to bed when

he's tired and eat when he's hungry kind of thing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#80:1:A> So that there may not even be formal meal times
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#81:1:A> Which when you start <,> implementing a regimented school system

where they have to be there at nine o'clock in the morning and <}> <-> they

can't </-> <=> they're not </=> </}> supposed to sleep in and they should've

had breakfast before they came and all these things that we'd expect from

them <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#82:1:A> Expect them to be relatively rested and fed so that they can

concentrate <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#83:1:A> It's not really fair
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#84:1:A> And <}> <-> it's </-> <=> it's </=> </}> one of those things that

<}> <-> <.> y </.> </-> <=> you </=> </}> can't really go in and say well

this is what we demand <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#85:1:A> <unclear> word </unclear> <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#86:1:A> But then you <}> <-> kinda </-> <+> kind of </+> </}> have to try

to explain that <,> well if they did that then they would do better in school

<,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#87:1:A> So <}> <-> it's a </-> <=> it's a </=> </}> draw <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#88:1:A> <}> <-> And </-> <=> and </=> </}> <}> <-> <.> th </.> </-> <=>

there're </=> </}> a lot of parents now <}> <-> that </-> <=> that </=> </}>

<}> <-> are </-> <=> have </=> </}> gone through enough of the school system

to know <}> <-> what <,> is <.> ex </.> what we expect what </-> <=> we have

</=> </}> our preconceived notions of what school should be when we go out

there

<$ZJ> <ICE-CAN:S2A-039#89:1:Z> So there's a difference between older parents and younger

parents

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-039#90:1:A> There is
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#91:1:A> Sometimes it's not uhm necessarily a favourable difference
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#92:1:A> Like theoretically you can think that oh well a parent who's gone

through either the federal system or the residential school well they know

what school's about so they should be more sympathetic or more <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#93:1:A> You know where it is <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#94:1:A> More uhh uhm able to help their child
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#95:1:A> <unclear> six or seven words </unclear> <O> aside </O> I'll just

stick it there for now <,> uhm
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#96:1:A> But that's not always the case <}> <-> sometimes </-> <=> sometimes

</=> </}> they have had bad experiences and they tend to think that their

idea of school <}> <-> is </-> <=> is </=> </}> not a good one uhm <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#97:1:A> But sometimes the older parents <,> uh <,> <}> <-> they </-> <=>

they </=> </}> understand that there is a value to school they don't

understand how the system works necessarily <}> <-> they don't necessarily

</-> <=> they're not really </=> </}> able to help in any way but
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#98:1:A> No most certainly the likelihood of any parent being able to help

with homework <,> is very very very unlikely that you'll find parents <}> <->

that </-> <=> that </=> </}> can do that
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#99:1:A> <}> <-> Or </-> <=> Or </=> </}> are willing to do that cos they

don't necessarily know that it's something that would be good to do
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#100:1:A> <O> aside, talking about something in the room </O> Let's just

throw that on the floor <O> audience laughs </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#101:1:A> Uhm <,,> uhh <,> and a lot of the time you'll find that <}> <->

you have </-> <=> children have </=> </}> very old parents
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#102:1:A> Report card day comes and the parents come and meet you <}> <->

and </-> <=> and </=> </}> you think <,,> is this that woman's child <O>

laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#103:1:A> It's just not biologically possible
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#104:1:A> Uhm adoption is a very <,,> different thing in the north
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#105:1:A> For one <}> <-> <.> y </.> if </-> <=> if </=> </}> it's between

northern families they don't go through the whole legal <,> nightmare that

everyone seems to have to go through down here
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#106:1:A> They often will adopt uhm <,> like <}> <-> <.> i </.> if </-> <=>

if </=> </}> a girl gets pregnant <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#107:1:A> A teenage girl gets pregnant <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#108:1:A> It's not considered <,> a problem
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#109:1:A> It's not considered something bad or something <,> stigmatic
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#110:1:A> There's nothing stigmatic about it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#111:1:A> If she decides to keep the baby that's fine
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#112:1:A> If she decides <}> <-> it really </-> <=> she doesn't </=> </}>

feel she <,> wants to be bothered about it the mother will adopt it <}> <->

or </-> <=> or </=> </}> the grandmother might or another family in the

village
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#113:1:A> <}> <-> <.> I </.> </-> <=> It </=> </}> usually keeps within

family <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}> child will stay in the family but

sometimes <}> <-> the </-> <=> they'll </=> </}> be adopted to another family

or
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#114:1:A> So that's where you get these women or <.> mo </.> mm these

parents who are definitely grandparent age you know <O> laugh </O> if not

great-grandparent age who have these like really young children
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#115:1:A> So it's kind of an interesting thing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#116:1:A> It certainly makes for interesting translation of report card
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#117:1:A> It definitely <unclear> two or three words </unclear> and try and

explain <,> what social studies are <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#118:1:A> It's <,> very exciting <O> laugh </O>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#119:1:A> Report cards are a lot of fun
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#120:1:A> In the smaller communities you go around to the houses and you

visit and that's just great that's uhh
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#121:1:A> You really get to know people
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#122:1:A> Even in the big communities
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#123:1:A> <}> <-> <.> Com </.> </-> <=> Kuujjuaq </=> </}> is a little

different but in Inukjuak where <}> <-> I w </-> <=> I can </=> </}> honestly

say I don't know everybody in the village and I've lived there three years

<,> you still get to know families <}> <-> of your <.> chi </.> </-> <=> of

your children </=> </}> and you know
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#124:1:A> Sometimes you don't <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}> know

what the household situation is like sometimes it's not a good situation but

you're aware of it and so you can react accordingly
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#125:1:A> You know that there's something been going on the family or that

the parents <,> drink or whatever so you know that the reason little Bobby is

going berserk on you is <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#126:1:A> There are reasons
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#127:1:A> It's not just cos he's being a pain in the butt today

<$ZK> <ICE-CAN:S2A-039#128:1:Z> <O> audience member asks a question </O>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2A-039#129:1:A> It's a difficult <,> thing
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#130:1:A> Uhm <,> a lot of the time <,,> <}> <-> we're </-> <,,> <=> we're

</=> </}> viewed as people who are coming to give them a service <,> to do

something and they really appreciate that we're coming to do that but getting

involved in their personal <,> problems is something else <,>
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#131:1:A> If <,> well obviously if you think a child is being abused you

can't just sit back and <,> not do something about it
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#132:1:A> I mean as a teacher <}> <-> as </-> <=> as </=> </}> a

professional you cannot <,> just <,> yeah
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#133:1:A> <}> <-> <.> S </.> uh <.> s </.> </-> <=> As </=> </}> a human

being but also as a teacher you have a legal obligation <}> <-> to </-> <=>

to </=> </}> try and do something
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#134:1:A> So you have to go through the sort of proper channels of the

principal and
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#135:1:A> In every school there's a principal and uh what's called a centre

director who is uhm always an Inuit person uh <unclear> word </unclear> uhm
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#136:1:A> They are like <}> <-> the <.> li </.> </-> <=> a liaison </=> </}>

with the community
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#137:1:A> They're an administrator within the school but their primary

function is to make sure everything runs smoothly with the community so the

community understands what's going on
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#138:1:A> So they would be like really the most appropriate person to see

and you would approach them and talk to them about the situation
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#139:1:A> And they will also know more
<ICE-CAN:S2A-039#140:1:A> They will more likely know more about the situation than you do

anyway so they will know the family they will know of anything that has been

done in the past </I>
