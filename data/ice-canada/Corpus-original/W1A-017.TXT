<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-017#1:1> After Ellen comes back to civilisation she says this comment,

which was first said to her by Mrs. Oakes.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#2:1> Since <del> she </del> Ellen repeats this line, one would think she

believed in it, and her connection with men seems to verify it.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#3:1> However, while she is among the aboriginals she is a strong woman,

able to survive in the wilderness, among people who treat her as a slave.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#4:1> A woman who needed to cling to a husband like moss to a tree would not

be able to survive these conditions, yet Ellen does.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#5:1> On the other hand, Ellen, does move from man to man if one looks at

her relations with Austin, her husband, then Garnet, her lover, Jack Chance,

her rescuer, and Mr. Jevans, a potential love interest.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#6:1> This passage, said to her by Mrs. Oakes, applies to Ellen while she is

back in civilization.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#7:1> The idea that a woman must depend on a man is imposed on her again

<del> while </del> when she comes back as it is likely she will get into a

relationship with Mr. Jevans.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#8:1> Ellen also needed a man to get back to civilisation, or else she

believes so, as she says that Jack was her only way back to civilisation.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#9:1> But at other times in the novel, Ellen is compared to a tree, not moss

as she is seen as a strong person, which is the way I think readers would

like to see her. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-017#10:1> In A Wedding in Spring, Flo, Snooker, Beresford, and

Knickerbocker have come to London from the West Indies.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#11:1> They have come from a place where they were the majority to a place

where they're the minority.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#12:1> They have only heard about London and now they are actually in

London, getting a lesson in what it's really like there.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#13:1> Beresford is getting married and <del> <.> wha </.> </del> wants his

wedding to be in true English style with a <}> <-> limosuine </-> <+>

limousine </+> </}> and a tuxedo, he wants Snooker and Knickerbocker to wear

top hats.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#14:1> But the wedding turns into a disaster and they make fools of

themselves in front of the English and Irish people.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#15:1> They learn that they cannot imitate the English gentleman and his

ways.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#16:1> They are not able to assimilate.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#17:1> Flo is against the wedding but in the end realizes she must stick

with her brothers.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#18:1> She learns that in a city where they can't totally fit in, she must

at least support her family. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-017#19:1> Here Dr. Naigar is seen cleaning.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#20:1> The stereotype Mara is working against here is that Indians are

dirty.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#21:1> <del> The </del> Of Customs and Excise begins with Dr. Bridget having

a nightmare about Dr. Naigar putting feces in her mouth, associating the

Indian doctor with filth, but in this passage we see that Dr. Naigar is a

clean doctor.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#22:1> Dr. Naigar says to Dr. Bridget that she also knows how to <}> <->

practice </-> <+> practise </+> </}> medicine in a sarcastic tone because in

this scene Dr. Bridget has told Parvati and Mrs Ungoli that Parvati is 3 or 4

months pregnant.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#23:1> This is a big mistake because Parvati was only married to Mohan, Mrs.

Ungoli's son, 3 months ago.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#24:1> However, Dr. Bridget doesn't know this, and Dr. Naigar makes it clear

to Dr. Bridget that she must take the whole situation into account, not only

the medical aspect of a situation.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#25:1> She is sarcastic because Dr. Bridget wants to insist that she is

right, but Dr. Naigar points out that <ul> she </ul> is right in protecting

<del> Dr. </del> Parvati.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#26:1> Although Dr. Bridget may tend to look down on the Indian doctor, she

cannot, because Dr. Naigar knows some things she doesn't know. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-017#27:1> This version of the Drover's Wife is the first one written.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#28:1> It tells the story of a woman who must protect her family while her

husband is <}> <-> of </-> <+> off </+> </}> droving.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#29:1> It lists the things she must do as she becomes the man of the house.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#30:1> She <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> kills a snake,

chases off a swagman, and in this passage, fights a fire.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#31:1> The fact that she is wearing trousers shows that she is indeed taking

the place of the man in the house.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#32:1> While her elder son laughs at this sight, her baby doesn't even

recognize her as <del> he </del> the baby truly just sees a man.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#33:1> The drover's wife becomes the " phallic man" in this story, or at

least she almost does.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#34:1> She still remains a woman in need in that she has the dog and her son

Tommy to help her with the beating of the snake.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#35:1> And in this passage the four bush men help her put out the fire.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#36:1> Since this story is popular with men, it is important that the woman

not become too independent.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#37:1> She must still go for Sunday walks and read Young Ladies Journal, and

she must still be rescued in the nick of time, by men. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-017#38:1> Anansi, the trickster spiderman, is called a <quote> forgetting

</quote> spider man and this passage refers to why he must forget.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#39:1> He forgets, not because he is stupid, but because he must protect

himself.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#40:1> He denies terrible things that have happened to black people so that

he can survive and not become utterly depressed and uncontrollably angry,

which one could expect for the unfair treatment of blacks.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#41:1> <del> <.> Th </.> As the </del> However, one must not totally forget

where one comes from as this story points out.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#42:1> When Anansi comes to the <del> foreing </del> foreign land of Soot he

paints himself white so that he can move among the other white people.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#43:1> There is a reference to a wrongdoing to a black person in that one is

hung, but the white person Anansi talks to doesn't seem to know why, he also

is denying what is happening to the blacks.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#44:1> In the end of the story Anansi can't get the white paint off because

it has sunk into his skin.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#45:1> This is metaphoric of course in that Anansi has been denying <del>

<.> th </.> </del> his blackness for so long while he was in <del> <unclear>

unclear word </unclear> </del> Soot, that he cannot retain his true colour.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-017#46:1> In this scene Jangamuttuk is performing a ceremony in which he

combines European ways with his aboriginal practices.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#47:1> In the ceremony he is trying to get rid <del> <unclear> one word

</unclear> </del> of the ghosts, of the whites, Fada and Mada.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#48:1> Jangamuttuk is master of the ghost dreaming in that he is able to

make the ghosts leave in the end.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#49:1> In this scene, Fada wants an end to the ceremony because it is not

Christian.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#50:1> But Fada does not even realize what the ceremony is truly about.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#51:1> A major theme in the novel is that while Fada doesn't understand the

aboriginals, they understand him.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#52:1> Jangamuttuk is not really scared of Fada, he does not end the

ceremony because he wants to listen to Fada's orders - he just stops to "

humour" him.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#53:1> It says he tensed then relaxed, he only tenses because he's not sure

who it is, but once Jangamuttuk sees it is Fada, he relaxes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-017#54:1> In Lawson's " Drover's Wife" and Mara's <ul> Of Customs and

Excise </ul> women are depicted as profoundly different from men, as living

in a women's world of children, relationships, and domestic tasks.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#55:1> However, while each work portrays women in this stereotypical

fashion, " Drover's Wife" ultimately reinforces the stereotype, while <ul> Of

Customs and Excise </ul> subverts it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-017#56:1> In Lawson's " Drover's Wife", the woman must take care of her

children, cooking and cleaning for them while her husband is off droving.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#57:1> Her place is at home while her husband's <del> is off </del> place is

off in the " workplace".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#58:1> At one level, the story also seems to portray a strong, independent,

brave woman who takes on the qualities of a male as she kills a snake, scares

off a swagman, and fights a fire.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#59:1> She comes even closer to being a man when she puts on her husband's

trousers when fighting the fire.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#60:1> Rather than stepping into his shoes, she steps into his pants.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#61:1> It seems that the drover's wife has the best of both worlds as she

can be a loving mother and housewife, but can also be a strong, independent

female.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#62:1> However, Lawson does not allow this kind of portrayal. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-017#63:1> Ultimately, the drover's wife is indeed a female <del> <unclear>

unclear word </unclear> </del> in a different world than males.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#64:1> She is not truly living as an independent woman as she has her dog

and her son Tommy who insists he will never leave his mummy as he knows, as a

male, <del> a </del> that she must need him.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#65:1> She is in her own world as she reads " Young <w> Ladies' </w>

Journal" and gets <del> <.> dre </.> </del> her and her children dressed up

for a Sunday walk.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#66:1> <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> Through this walk, she

can put on a show of <}> <-> feminity </-> <+> femininity </+> </}> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#67:1> In a world of Australian wilderness that threatens to mask her female

side, she is still able to display it, although one wonders if this is for

her benefit or the male <w> readers' </w> benefit as it is too scary to see a

female become too " male".
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#68:1> Moreover, in the fire fighting scene, she is not able to subdue <del>

it </del> the fire alone as four bush men rush in at <quote> the nick of time

</quote> <del> to </del> so that she is not <quote> mastered </quote> by the

fire.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#69:1> Although she does take on some " male" qualities, in the end the

woman is simply a drover's <ul> wife </ul> . </p>

<p> In <ul> Of Customs and Excise </ul> Parvati <del> and </del> seems to be

perfect, obedient Indian bride.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#70:1> She willingly marries Mohan, although she doesn't love him, <del> and

</del> bears him a child, and cooks for the Ungoli household.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#71:1> However, as one looks into Parvati's past, one sees she is not a

perfect, pure, bride. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-017#72:1> While Parvati engages in an obedient marriage with Mohan, she

only does so <del> to </del> cover up her soiled past.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#73:1> Parvati has a sexual relationship with another man <del> and </del>

whom she truly loves; however, when she finds out he is from a lower social

class than her she realizes she cannot marry him.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#74:1> Thus, she quickly marries Mohan in order to cover up that she has a

baby out of wedlock.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#75:1> When the reader has this knowledge of Parvati's past, one looks back

at her domestic obedience, cooking and accepting Mohan's orders, as a cover

to the truly independent woman.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#76:1> Parvati <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> controlled her

fate.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#77:1> <ul> She </ul> decided to have a relationship with her first lover,

and <ul> she </ul> decided to marry Mohan to protect herself and her

daughter. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-017#78:1> A quality inherent to women in <ul> Of Customs and Excise </ul>

is the close bond between mother and daughter, which we see between Mala and

Parvati.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#79:1> Parvati feels this bond with her own mother and after mother dies she

says she will always carry <del> a <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del>

her mother inside her.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#80:1> Parvati tells Mala that she will also carry her mother inside her

when she, Parvati, dies.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#81:1> While Mala denies a typically domestic life like her mothers, she

eventually settles into a marriage and has a daughter, however, one also sees

how Mala subverts this female stereotype. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-017#82:1> Mala takes control of her life by leaving her parents having

sexual encounters before marriage.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#83:1> She decides to go to school and decides when and whom she will marry.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#84:1> <del> While </del> She is different from her brothers in her intense

relationship with her mother.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#85:1> While she tries to deny her mother, in the end she can't help but

recall in " Daffodils" <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> that

she will also carry her mother's memory with her.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#86:1> She realizes her mother wanted the best for her as she slipped the

money under her door.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#87:1> Yet, while Mala has this female trait, she does not take on a passive

<del> female </del> role which usually <del> differs females </del> polarizes

women from <del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> women. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-017#88:1> The final character in <ul> Of Customs and Excise </ul> who <del>

subverts </del> seems to uphold yet ultimately subverts the role of females,

<del> <unclear> unclear word </unclear> </del> is <del> Asha </del> Asha.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#89:1> As Bridget's servant, <del> one <.> se </.> </del> Asha is definitely

domestic as she cleans and cooks for Bridget.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#90:1> Asha also helps at a her home where she lives with her sister Sundri

and Sundri's husband Tilak, and their children.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#91:1> Asha also helps <del> cares </del> care for Sundri's children <del>

and </del> as she makes them wash up and is concerned that they eat, <?> thus

</?> she sends them with Sundri, to <?> Pekha's </?> wedding.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#92:1> However, it is in this domestic setting that Asha overcomes a man in

that she kills Tillak, while in the Parvati - Mohan relationship Mohan plays

the typically stronger, tyrannical man, here Tilak is weak and <del> at the

<.> w </.> </del> his fate is in hands of Asha.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-017#93:1> Asha uses food, something typically associated with female

preparation, to force feed Tlak and <del> make </del> kill him <del> with

</del> . </p> </I>
