<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#1:1> Until the last 10 to 15 years, the interpretation of Canadian

labour history has always come from the 'Whig Interpretation'.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#2:1> That is, the institutionalization of labour relations are been seen as

progressive, thus creating the notion that <quote> " ...once there was only a

ragged army of beleaguered unions, we now find imposing array of duly

certified bargaining units." </quote> <fnr> 1 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#3:1> The popular interpretation of Canadian labour history today opposes

this point of view.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#4:1> Most historian(s) today seem to base their evidence within a regional

context.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#5:1> This seems to be the case in the book <ul> Workers and the State </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#6:1> The young historians that have presented essays in the collection

concentrates on four main themes: workers and the government, workers and

political parties, workers and the union structure, and the workers and the

company. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#7:1> Many essays in <ul> Workers and the State </ul> look at the

fundamental relationship of the worker and the governmental structure.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#8:1> As stated previously, the views of past historians seem to be that the

state has created this impressive and beneficial system within which labour

operates.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#9:1> Many authors rescind this point of view, saying that the state has

only succeeded in restricting the rights of union members during labour

negotiations.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#10:1> Craig Heron outlined this idea in the Afterward of the collection.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#11:1> He stated that until the Industrial Disputes Act of 1907, most of the

labours involved in the unions could strike anytime they wished over any

issue they felt prudent.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#12:1> When this act became law, the problems that the workers wished to

strike over were presented to a conciliation board and then, only after a 30

day waiting period could the union go on strike. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#13:1> Suzanne Morton also attacked government intervention in her essay

on labour relations during the reconstruction of Halifax.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#14:1> She studied the conflict between the Halifax Relief Commission ( HRC)

and the skilled labourers that came to the city to work on construction.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#15:1> The provincial government gave the power of setting wages to the HRC,

thus the traditional employee-employer relationship was in jeopardy.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#16:1> When the workers struck over wages and the use of migrant-unskilled

workers, the conservative HRC just employed scab labours.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#17:1> The HRC attacked the attitudes of the skilled labours, that mostly

resided in the areas that involved in the explosion. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#18:1> In Fred Winsor's essay on the battle by the offshore fishermen

for worker's compensation.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#19:1> Winsor reveals the position of the fishermen by showing how, because

of a lack of a strong union, they were unable to gain provincial compensation

without paying an extremely high cost ( at times &dollar;20 for every

&dollar;100 of income).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#20:1> This essay show how a government program, which was available to most

of Nova Scotia's workers, was withheld from a deserving group because of the

lack of a unified voice. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#21:1> Finally, Kirby Abbott looked at government intervention in the

Nova Scotia coal industry at the latter decades of the 19th century.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#22:1> With the Coal Mines Regulation Act and the encouragement of the

creation of the Dominion Coal Company ( Domco), the provincial government

would not support the creation of unions, such as a branch of the United Mine

Workers.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#23:1> The government used its authority to suppress radical labour

movements and promote big business. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#24:1> As well as looking at the relationship between the worker and the

state, <ul> Workers and the State </ul> also investigates the theme of

workers and politics.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#25:1> At the turn of the century, most of the unions began affiliating with

the Communist Party, which in turn took over much of the leadership.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#26:1> In the 1930's, the social-democratic Cooperative Commonwealth

Federation was formed and preached a milder form of socialism.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#27:1> Michael Earle and Hebert Gamberg investigated the coming of the CCF

into the Cape Breton area.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#28:1> It seems at this time, most of the labour membership was moving

toward a less radical stance, thus embraced the CCF with great enthusiasm.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#29:1> Michael Earle also investigated the importance of the CCF in the

executive of the unions of Nova Scotia.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#30:1> In this essay, Earle showed how right-wing and radical communist

factions battled for control of the unions.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#31:1> During this process, the CCF was trying to destroy the influence of

the communists in their unions. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#32:1> An important aspect of Nova Scotia labour which <ul> Workers and

the State </ul> looks at is the relationship between the worker and the union

leadership.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#33:1> Many essays in the collection focus on this theme.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#34:1> Jay White covered this aspect in his essay that looked strike for

check-off in the Halifax Shipyards.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#35:1> In a battle with the Halifax Shipyard Limited, the workers fought for

the union security and the automatic taking off union dues from all

employees.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#36:1> White points out that collapse of the strike and the downfall of the

union was based on the mismanagement of strike funds and company sympathy by

the leadership. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#37:1> This problem was also faced by Anthony Thompson in his study of

the unionization of the Nova Scotia civil service.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#38:1> In this essay, he shows how the executive of the union forced the

wage ceiling of 5% on arbitrated contracts.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#39:1> The leadership made the workers support the policy under the fear of

a strike option presented by Gerald Regan, the Liberal Premier. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#40:1> Finally, <ul> Worker and the State </ul> looks at the

relationship between the worker and the company.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#41:1> Both C.H.J. Gilson and A.M. Wadden as well as E. Jean Ninbet looked

at this issue in their respective essays.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#42:1> Nisbet showed how the attempt by the Nova Scotia fishermen to form a

union was defeated by the strong, monopolistic National Sea fish company.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#43:1> The company would not allow the fishermen to <}> <-> loss </-> <+>

lose </+> </}> their status as 'co-adventurers'.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#44:1> Gilson and Wadden studied the Windsor Gypsum Strike and the formation

of the Joint Labour/Management Study Committee by the Nova Scotia government.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#45:1> They found that labour really had very little power within the

committee and was manipulated by the government backed business interests.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#46:1> The book <ul> Workers and the State </ul> has essays that have

common themes that links group of them together.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#47:1> These themes or relationships include: workers and the government,

workers and political parties, workers and union leadership, and finally,

workers and the company.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#48:1> These are all themes that are relevant to the general study of labour

history today. </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#49:2> George F. Keenan had mixed feelings about the Nuremberg Trials.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#50:2> He felt that the crimes of the Nazis were in <l> numberable and held

no synpathy towards them, but he strongly opposed to any programs of

denazification.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#51:2> Kennan felt great remorse over the plans that the Allies had in

relation to the treatment of Germans over the punishment for the war crimes

committed.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#52:2> He thought that the choice of carrying out public trials was

inappropriate in that it could not undo any of the crimes, and that when the

Soviets were taken in as Allies the Americans also excepted the customs of

warfare which went on in Eastern Europe and Asia for centuries. <fnr> 52

</fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#53:2> These customs were not particular or genuine to Germany.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#54:2> In Kennan's view, this procedure of incriminating the Germans was

wrong in that it led people to believe that these crimes were justifiable

when com <l> mitted by one government, but unjustifiable and punishable by

death when committed by another government. <fnr> 53 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#55:2> He stated that the best treatment towards Germany would have been to

show that Germany was not strong enough to pose a threat to other great

powers, and an attempt in this direction would only be unsuc <l> cessful and

lead to disaster. <fnr> 54 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#56:2> Kennan was particularly disturbed to see the Americans associate

themselves with the Russians when judging the conduct of the Germans, and

felt a deep sense of despair and frustration. <fnr> 55 </fnr> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#57:2> To the Americans, and certainly their Allies, the Nurem <l> berg

Trials were seen as completely necessary in order to hurt Germany for

initiating war and for the countless, and harsh crimes committed.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#58:2> But, as in any case, there will be individ <l> uals who disagree with

this belief, one being George F. Kennan.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#59:2> He was unable to see how the Allies, particularly the Soviets, could

punish the Germans for the same crimes they had them <l> selves committed,

the only difference being they were conducted under different governments.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#60:2> When the trials came to an end on August 31, 1946, nineteen German

men were found guilty on various charges, with the sentences ranging from ten

years in jail to the death penalty, and three individuals were acquit <l>

ted. <fnr> 56 </fnr>
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#61:2> The brutal violence and evil crimes that occurred during World War II

were intolerable acts that could not be left al <l> one, merely forgotten,

without calling them to the attention of the public.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#62:2> It will never be known whether the trials were the best method of

penalizing the Germans, but at that time certain measures had to be carried

out in order for the world to rest after such a traumatic experience as total

war. </p> </I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#63:3> In examining a work as unique as " Kubla Khan", it is crucial to

go beyond simply looking at the structure and symbols used; one must take

into account the details of the author's life.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#64:3> If a thought may be borrowed from the film " Dead <}> <-> Poet's </->

<+> Poets </+> </}> Society", the reader must do more than objectively

evaluate and graph poetry, as the moth-balled J. Evans Pritchard would tell

us to do.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#65:3> It is crucial, especially with the Romantic poets to understand them

in the context of their attempts to convey the <quote> " spontaneous overflow

of powerful feelings" </quote> ( Wordsworth 160).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#66:3> In this case let us examine Coleridge as a person.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#67:3> He grew up in London, and never experienced the wild country to the

extent his good friend Wordsworth did ( 328).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#68:3> Always known as a dreamer, Coleridqe's addiction to laudanum, with

its hallucinogenic properties, no doubt added a new dimension to his

dreaming.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#69:3> That Coleridge was capable of such fanciful notions is not in

question. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#70:3> " Kubla Khan"; This mysterious poem has many possible

interpretations.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#71:3> Nothing is going on in the poem in terms of actions or events taking

place.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#72:3> In the first two sections Coleridge lays out his vision, and in the

last section he assumes the voice of the narrator and explains the danger of

glimpsing at this forbidden paradise. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#73:3> The vision is composed of many images.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#74:3> <quote> " A sunny pleasure dome with caves of ice" </quote> (

355)contrasts hot with cold.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#75:3> Throughout the poem a dark feeling of sexuality and of life itself

pervades.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#76:3> The pleasure dome may refer to a female breast, and images of

caverns, fertile grounds, forests, deep romantic chasms slanting down the

green hill and a woman wailing for her demon lover all trigger erotic

thoughts ( 354-355).
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#77:3> Most obvious is the passage: <X> <quote> And from this chasm, with

ceaseless turmoil seething, As if this earth in fast thick pants were

breathing, A mighty fountain momently was forced: Amid whose swift

half-intermitted burst Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail </quote>

</X> , ( 355 17-21)
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#78:3> This passage may be interpreted as a well-expressed description of a

female giving birth, or possibly of male ejaculation. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#79:3> Alph, the sacred river connects this birth with the pleasure

dome, and the river <quote> " meanders with a mazy motion" </quote> from

fertile grounds through the <quote> " caverns measureless to man" </quote>

down to a sunless sea, which is lifeless.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#80:3> This suggests the cyclical passage of life towards eternity or death

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#81:3> In the last section the poet assumes the narrative voice.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#82:3> He explains how if he could describe what he saw, namely the vision

of the pleasure dome and the caves of ice, as clearly as the damsel with her

dulcimer sings of the paradise of Mount Abora ( 355), then people would think

him insane and would alienate him as someone who has experienced forbidden

things. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#83:3> Coleridge feels he has had a forbidden experience partially

because of the guilt he feels in abusing the drug opium, and also because he

doubts the general public will either understand or accept the fantastic

vision he has seen: <X> <quote> Weave a circle round him thrice And close

your eyes with holy dread, For he on honeydew hath fed, And drunk the milk of

Paradise. </quote> </X> ( 355) </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1A-007#84:3> Undoubtedly some feel " Kubla Khan" is incomplete, but Coleridge

can go no further.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#85:3> It is not possible to finish up because <}> <-> if </-> <+> of </+>

</}> the way the images were collected.
<ICE-CAN:W1A-007#86:3> Recollections gathered from being half asleep, with a hazy memory,

are just that; half remembered. </p> </I>
