<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#1:1> No one would ever know she was lying.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#2:1> Hannah shifted in her desk, third from the front, and waited for the

first morning bell.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#3:1> Christmas decorations still coloured the room in red and green paper

chains, gold Bethlehem stars and silver holiday trees.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#4:1> Angels decorated the four windows, blessing each person who entered

the grade three classroom.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#5:1> Someone had written <mention> " Happy New Year" </mention> across the

entire length of the blackboard. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#6:1> After the bell rang, Miss Brown rapped on her desk with a ruler

and the children all turned to the front.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#7:1> Twenty-eight students; many of their cheeks were red <l> dened from

playing outdoors, others still glowed from the excitement of holidays.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#8:1> Hannah's face was pale and she chewed on her lower lip as the class

settled.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#9:1> Her hand darted in and out of her pocket. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#10:1> The teacher looked fresh in a new soft pink turtleneck, probably

a gift from her <}> <-> fee-awn-say </-> <+> fianc&eacute; </+> </}> ,

thought Hannah.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#11:1> Her dark blue pants made her appear slimmer than she really was.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#12:1> Hannah had hoped that she would be wearing the apple-red dress she

had worn to the Christmas concert, with the dainty lace collar and pearl

drops at her ears, but it didn't matter.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#13:1> Miss Brown always looked pretty. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#14:1> How happy Hannah had been on that night, up on stage with all the

other children, singing, <quote> " Winter Wonderland." </quote>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#15:1> The girls swayed in time with the music, the boys rang the

tambourines. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#16:1> <quote> " Sleigh-bells ring, are you <w> list'nin' </w> ? "

</quote> ( ring, ring)
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#17:1> <quote> " In the lane, snow is <w> glist'nin' </w> " </quote> ( ring,

ring)
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#18:1> Even Johnny Hawkins, who always pulled her braids and made up dirty

lyrics in music class, was singing along that night.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#19:1> His grey hawk-eyes were fixed on Miss Brown's dancing hands. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#20:1> When the song was over, the applause burst from the audience of

parents, grandparents, teachers and fellow students, and Hannah thought it

was the most beautiful sound she had ever heard.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#21:1> Without thinking, she had clapped as well, until all her classmates

were looking at her and her face burned redder than Miss Brown's velvet

dress. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#22:1> " You don't clap for yourself, stupid," said Tracy Dyck from

behind her.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#23:1> " Everyone is staring at you." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#24:1> Hannah returned to her seat in the gym but her neck continued to

burn; through <quote> " Jingle Bell Rock," </quote> <quote> " Joy to the

World," </quote> and finally, <quote> " Deck the Halls." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#25:1> Her mother decided they had better not stay after <l> ward for

coffee.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#26:1> Hannah was glad.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#27:1> She stumbled in the snow as she ran toward the car and waited on the

freez <l> ing seat for her mother and sister to follow. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#28:1> " Hannah, I really enjoyed the concert," her mother assured her.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#29:1> She rubbed her gloved hands together while the big car slowly came to

life.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#30:1> Mary, her older sister, snickered beside her and Hannah felt the heat

rise to her face once again.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#31:1> She pulled the thick scarf around her, shielding her tears from them

both. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#32:1> " Daddy wanted to come," her mother said.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#33:1> " He's just not feeling too well tonight, girls.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#34:1> I know he would have been so proud of you both." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#35:1> It was a silent ride home.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#36:1> Mother didn't like the girls to talk when the roads were slippery.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#37:1> The moon had disappeared behind mountains of black clouds, so it was

dark, too.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#38:1> If they slid off the narrow road that snaked toward their farm, it

might be hours before anyone found them.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#39:1> Her father would be furious, hav <l> ing to come out with the truck

on such a stormy December night, especially when he " wasn't feeling too

well," as her mother put it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#40:1> Hannah knew that her father's frequent illnesses had something to

do with the old yellow cupboard in the cellar.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#41:1> He was never " feeling too well <}> <-> ' </-> <+> " </+> </}> after

he'd been into the cupboard and the smelly brown bottles it contained. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#42:1> Hannah pressed her nose against the cold window and searched for

a lone star in the blackness. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#43:1> " I wish I may, I wish I might, had not been so dumb tonight."

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#44:1> At home, the girls quickly returned their dresses to hangers and

placed them at the back of the closet.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#45:1> Hannah knew it would be a long time before they would need them

again.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#46:1> She was happy to take off the scratchy woolen jumper and creamy

high-collared blouse.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#47:1> They made her feel like something was crawling up the back of her

neck to her hair.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#48:1> She couldn't imagine what it was like to have to dress up every

Sunday, like Melody and Mary Ellen who went to the United Church and were

awarded gold pins for perfect attendance.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#49:1> There was no end to their dresses, as far as Hannah could see: yellow

and orange cotton sundresses for summer, dark skirts and matching sweaters

for winter. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#50:1> Johnny Hawkins liked it when they wore dresses to school.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#51:1> He would drop his eraser or pencil on the floor, then crouch down and

sneak peeks between their legs.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#52:1> At recess, he would tell all the other boys what colour panties they

were wearing. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#53:1> If the girls caught him, they'd let out high-pitched squeals, the

way rats do when they're shot.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#54:1> Then Miss Brown would make Johnny sit in the corner, facing the other

students. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#55:1> Breakfast was porridge and brown sugar.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#56:1> They'd had oranges over Christmas, a gift from Mr. Olson in town.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#57:1> Hannah longed for that sweetness again.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#58:1> Even the brightness of colour would be nice on this cold dark

morning. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#59:1> Her mother stood by the stove, looking at an old <it> Reader's

Digest </it> while she waited for the coffee to brew.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#60:1> She seemed so tired in her faded beige housedress.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#61:1> Hannah could see the outline of flowers on the dress, but couldn't

remember what they looked like before they had begun to disappear.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#62:1> Miss Brown would never wear anything like that, Hannah thought.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#63:1> Her mother did not use make-up and seldom fixed her hair.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#64:1> Somedays, she didn't even bother to comb it. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#65:1> " Why bother?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#66:1> No one is coming out here to visit and it's not my day to go into

town." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#67:1> Go into town.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#68:1> Hannah recalled that scorching day last July when she went with her

mother to deliver the eggs.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#69:1> Her mother pulled the old truck to a stop in front of a flat,

mustard-coloured home.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#70:1> A bungalow, Hannah had heard them called.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#71:1> She applied her shoulder to the sticking truck door, which slowly

creak <l> ed open.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#72:1> It reminded Hannah of the sound Dracula's coffin made when it opened.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#73:1> She had watched the movie with her sister and cousin Rose two years

earlier, and still wouldn't look into mirrors when she was alone, for fear

her reflection would not stare back. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#74:1> Hannah followed her mother across the street and admired the

marigolds and pansies that welcomed them to the house.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#75:1> Her mother was wearing the navy dress she had bought on sale at

Kresge's, but had slippers on her feet.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#76:1> Slippers, Hannah cringed, she hadn't even bothered to put on shoes.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#77:1> Her mother poked a stray hair behind one ear and Hannah noticed the

dark stain under her arm as she did. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#78:1> The door was opened by a slim blonde-haired lady whose thin dark

eyebrows formed a perfect arc over her icy blue eyes. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#79:1> " Who is it, Mom?"
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#80:1> A girl's voice called from inside the house.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#81:1> Hannah thought the voice sounded familiar. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#82:1> " No one.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#83:1> It's just the egg lady," the woman called back.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#84:1> She opened a purple sequined wallet and Hannah gazed at her long

pointed fingernails. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#85:1> " Here's two dollars," said the lady, whose eyes were ice.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#86:1> She handed the money to Hannah's mother, who reached for it with

dirty fingers. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#87:1> Walking back to the truck, Hannah felt someone was watching and

she turned to look again at the house.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#88:1> She caught a glimpse of blonde ringlets before the girl vanished

behind the gold curtain.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#89:1> So this is where Melody lives, she thought. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#90:1> The next day at school, the word spread like rabies. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#91:1> " Hey, Hannah, what did one egg say to the other egg?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#92:1> Let's get cracking." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#93:1> " Hey, little egg lady, did you hear the one about the mean chef?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#94:1> He beat his eggs." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#95:1> And later, when Spin the Bottle and Truth or Dare were popular in

the Melody and Johnny Hawkins crowd

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#96:1> " Hey, Hannah, do you <}> <-> wanna </-> <+> want to </+> </}>

get laid?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#97:1> " <}> <-> Whatsa </-> <+> What's the </+> </}> matter, you

chicken?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#98:1> After breakfast, Hannah heard her father cough and spit in the

bathroom as she sat on the wooden bench outside the front door.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#99:1> Smoker's cough.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#100:1> She'd never smoke when she grew up.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#101:1> Hannah could think of a lot of things she would never do. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#102:1> Mary was looking out the window beside her.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#103:1> " There's the bus, hurry up slowpoke."
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#104:1> Mary pushed her out the door into the blowing snow.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#105:1> Hannah took her seat at the back of the bus and peeked into her

pocket to make sure everything was still there. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#106:1> The snow crunched underneath the bus wheels, a sound Hannah

loved.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#107:1> She surveyed the farm as it got smaller behind her; the three-storey

house capped with three feet of snow, the leaning tool shed, abandoned

machinery and the chicken house, all disappeared in a swirl of white.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#108:1> It wasn't until years later that she learned it wasn't really even

their farm.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#109:1> Her father was renting the land from the Credit Union manager in

town. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#110:1> At school, Miss Brown welcomed them back and called out the

names for attendance &dotted-line; </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#111:1> " Becky." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#112:1> " Present." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#113:1> " Johnny." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#114:1> " Here." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#115:1> " Melody." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#116:1> " Here, I mean present." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#117:1> " Hannah." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#118:1> " Present." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#119:1> Miss Brown looked pleased that no one was absent.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#120:1> Even poor Christopher Donald, who'd had a sudden outbreak of chicken

pox just before the Christmas concert, had recovered and was now back in

school.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#121:1> His freckled pink skin was free from the ugly scabs that had covered

Hannah's body when she'd had chicken pox.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#122:1> Her mother said that Christopher was the only child she knew who got

chicken pox each year at Christmas and she thought it was such a ridiculous

lie.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#123:1> Everyone knew he was a Jehovah's Witness. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#124:1> The day seemed to drag.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#125:1> Was the clock even mov <l> ing?
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#126:1> Hannah wondered as she watched its black hands. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#127:1> " Hannah.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#128:1> Hannah.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#129:1> Could you please pay atten <l> tion?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#130:1> The children could hardly sit still, waiting for the last hour

when Show and Tell would begin.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#131:1> Christmas treasures poked out of bags and boxes where nervous

parents had written, " This belongs to &dotted-line;" on the sides. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#132:1> Hannah had everything planned, but it was taking such a long

time.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#133:1> Melody skipped to the front of the class, carrying a doll that came

up to her waist.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#134:1> Its yellow ringlets were the same colour as Melody's own unnatural

curls. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#135:1> " &dotted-line; and a puppy from Grandpa, and two bottles of

&dotted-line;" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#136:1> Hannah looked at the clock again.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#137:1> The big hand was already at the three, there wasn't much time left.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#138:1> Hurry up, Melody, hurry up about your stupid old doll and pyjamas

with feet. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#139:1> " Thank you Melody, I'd say Santa Claus was very generous at

your house this year.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#140:1> Hannah, have you brought any gifts that you'd like to show the

class?" </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#141:1> Hannah slid out of her desk and took her place at the front.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#142:1> She could feel that her palms were sweating, and she wiped them on

her jeans before she spoke. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#143:1> " My Mom wouldn't let me bring my presents to school, in case

they got broken or dirty, but Santa came to my house too, and I can show you

pictures of everything I got." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#144:1> Hannah dug into her pocket and one by one, pulled out the shiny

crumpled pictures which she'd carefully cut out of the Sears catalogue.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#145:1> She showed them the toys first; Barbie and Ken, a doll that could

wet, a walkie talkie set, a Spirograph, a children's typewriter, and a blue

Krazy Karpet.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#146:1> Then there were games; Clue, Monopoly, Battling Tops, and Operation.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#147:1> Hannah left the clothes for last; a pair of pink corduroy pants

and a blouse of the same colour, pyjamas with straps that went under her

feet, fuzzy green slippers, black patent shoes, various dresses but none that

was " scratchy," several sweaters including one with Snoopy on it, and a long

blue coat trimmed with white fur. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#148:1> Mary Ellen whispered something to Melody, but Miss Brown was

quick to curtail them. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#149:1> " Girls, listen, please.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#150:1> Whispering is impolite." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2F-001#151:1> Hannah finished showing the pictures and returned to her desk

with all the gifts hidden again in her pocket. </I> <X>
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#X152:1> Johnny and Melody looked at one another, then at Hannah as the

final bell rang.
<ICE-CAN:W2F-001#X153:1> Hannah could hear them talking as she walked into the cloak room

and pulled her worn boots from the rack. </p> </X>
