<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#2:1> VANCOUVER ( CP) - Defensive lineman Brett Williams wept last

Sunday when the Edmonton Eskimos beat the Calgary Stampeders to advance to

the 1990 Grey Cup. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#3:1> But Williams, who had two quarterback sacks against Calgary in the

CFL's West Division final, says he'll be smiling all this week as the Eskimos

prepare for Sunday's championship game at B.C. Place Stadium against the

Winnipeg Blue Bombers. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#4:1> " It's going to be a fun week, I'm going to enjoy every day of

it," he said, making his first appearance in the Grey Cup after losing in

four previous divisional finals as a member of the Montreal Concordes, B.C.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#5:1> Lions and Edmonton. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#6:1> After the season the Eskimos have had - jumping to a 9-3 record,

only to finish at 10-8 and second in the West behind Calgary after losing

five of their last six - Williams said Edmonton has a new lease on life. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#7:1> The Eskimos have withstood injuries to star slotback Tom Richards,

No. 1 running back Reggie Taylor, rush end Stew Hill and others, setbacks

that could have meant disaster. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#8:1> They have also overcome reports of lack of leadership, an absence

of team togetherness and a black-white rift on the team to advance to their

12th championship appearance in 18 years. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#9:1> " Now we're here and I guess it took until we got our backs

absolutely up against the wall," said Williams.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#10:1> " We were the same team the whole way along ... we really did feel we

could turn it on when it came time." </p>

<p> " We didn't intentionally not play well, but when things happen to you

like they have the last few years - winning the West twice and not getting to

go to the Grey Cup - it makes you apprehensive." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#11:1> The Eskimos won the West in 1989 with a 16-2 record, but lost to

Saskatchewan in the division final.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#12:1> They also were division champions in 1988, but were bounced by the

Lions. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#15:2> The Canadian Press

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#16:2> Russians were playing a form of hockey long before the game was

embraced by Canadians, says a new book on the history of the sport in the

Soviet Union. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#17:2> Lawrence Martin says in <it> The Red Machine </it> that hockey

was played in Russia <quote> " before the first recorded Canadian

exhibition." </quote> </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#18:2> In North America, it's generally recognized that hockey

originated from a game played by Englishmen on the frozen harbor at Kingston,

Ont., in 1860.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#19:2> There are also claims that hockey - or hurley as it was known then -

was played in Nova Scotia as early as 1810. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#20:2> But Martin contends there is <quote> " documentary evidence that

Russians were playing the game in the middle of the 19th century" </quote> in

Lenin <l> grad, then known as St. Petersburg. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#21:2> " We live under this myth that it is a Canadian game," Martin

said in an interview from Ottawa, where he is a visiting lecturer at Carleton

University school of journalism. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#22:2> Martin did research for the book while in Moscow as a

correspondent for the Toronto <it> Globe and Mail </it> from 1985 to <w> ' 88

</w> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#23:2> The hockey he describes is more like bandy, a game thought to

have been born in England and played on ice with 11 players aside.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#24:2> The game employs a ball six centimetres in <?> diame <l> ter </?> and

sticks with upward curving <unclear> unclear word </unclear> similar to those

used for field hockey. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#25:3> <h> <bold> Perseverance may finally be rewarded </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#26:3> EDMONTON ( CP) - Once in a long while, there is a story like

Michael Bourgeau's to be told and retold during a Grey Cup week. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#27:3> It is a story about a boy's triumph over a terrifying condition

and a man's struggle to overcome a body that kept trying to quit on him.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#28:3> It's a story of perseverance which could be rewarded Sunday with a

championship ring, against fairly incredible odds. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#29:3> Bourgeau grew up in Montreal in a bilingual household believing

he could hear, when the truth was he could read lips in two languages well

enough to fool everyone, including himself. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#30:3> But then he didn't know what things were supposed to sound like.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#31:3> It was not until he was 12 years old that doctors discovered he was

largely deaf in one ear and partially deaf in the other. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#32:3> " It's nerve deafness from birth," the 29-year-old defensive end

said, still calm and low-key even after Sunday's 43-23 Western final victory

over the Calgary Stampeders, his finest game as a member of the Edmonton

Eskimos. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#36:4> NEW YORK - More than one-fifth of major league players earned

&dollar;1 million or more this year, a salary survey determined yesterday.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#37:4> The survey, based on contract data obtained from management and

player sources, showed that the &dollar;1 million plateau was attained by 162

players, or 22 per cent of the 735 who were on major league rosters or the

disabled list on Aug. 31.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#38:4> Last year, 106 players, or 14.7 per cent, gained that level. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#39:4> For the first time, a player reached &dollar;3 million or more

this year, with Robin Yount of Milwaukee earning &dollar;3.2 million.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#40:4> Twenty-eight other players, up from 20 a year ago, hit or surpassed

the &dollar;2 million mark. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#41:5> <h> <bold> Clemens ejected again </bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#42:5> BOSTON ( AP) - Roger Clemens was suspended for the first five

games of next season and fined &dollar;10,000 yesterday for behavior which

led to the Boston pitcher's ejection from the last game of the American

League playoffs. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#43:5> The penalty, announced by AL president Bobby Brown, will force

the Red Sox star to miss one start.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#44:5> It came a week after he earned a &dollar;50,000 bonus for finishing

second in the AL Cy Young Award voting and on the same day he earned another

&dollar;50,000 for finishing third in the AL most-valuable-player voting.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#45:5> Clemens was ejected by plate um <l> pire Terry Cooney in the

second inning of Oakland's 3-1 victory that completed the A's four-game sweep

Oct. 10. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#46:5> The altercation occurred after Cle <l> mens walked Willie

Randolph, giv <l> ing the A's, who led 1-0, runners on first and third.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#47:5> Cooney and Clemens got into a shouting match, and Cle <l> mens,

trying to get closer to Cooney, bumped Evans. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#48:5> After the game, Clemens and Cooney said that after Randolph

walked the pitcher shook his head. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#49:5> Cooney said he said, " I hope you're not shaking your head at

me."
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#50:5> He said, 'if you want to talk to me, take your mask off.'
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#51:5> By me not removing my mask and not getting into a verbal thing with

him, that was my way of warning him." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#52:5> " I was looking down," Clemens said.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#53:5> " I saw ( Cooney's) throat guard moving, so he was saying some <l>

thing.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#54:5> He thought I was talking to him.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#55:5> I told him, 'I'm not shaking my head at you.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#56:5> The problem was not with you.' " </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#58:6> <bold> By Peter Lowrey </bold>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#59:6> The Canadian Press

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#60:6> MONTREAL - The federal gov <l> ernment is practising "

white-collar terrorism" by allowing Quebec to split an environmental review

of the James Bay 2 power project, a Cree chief said yesterday. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#61:6> Romeo Saganash, executive chief the Grand Council of the Cree,

reacted angrily to the federal gov <l> ernment decision to allow Quebec to

assess the environmental impact of a road and airports for the giant dam

project before they assess the impact of the dams themselve. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#62:6> Quebec wants to build a 200-kilo <l> metre, &dollar;600-million

road into the isolated Great Whale River site next spring.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#63:6> To complete the megapro <l> ject on schedule, Quebec wants to begin

building the road in January. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#64:6> The Cree oppose splitting the re <l> view, saying that once

Quebec has spent &dollar;600 million on building roads and airports to reach

the site, the dams themselves will never be re <l> jected on environmental

grounds. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#65:6> " The agreement clearly states that hydroelectric projects and

their <}> <-> apurtenant </-> </}> <}> <+> appurtenant </+> </}> works are

subject to re <l> view," Saganash said, referring to the 1975 James Bay and

Northern Quebec Agreement signed by the Cree before James Bay 1 was built.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#66:6> On Monday, Raymond Robinson, a senior federal Environment Depart

<l> ment official, wrote to members of a committee studying the project to

say that the federal government acknowledged that Quebec has the right to

start building the road to the site before the dams themselves are approved.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#67:6> The project would create vast res <l> ervoirs covering 4,387

square kilo <l> metres of ancestral Cree land - flooding an area the size of

Prince Edward Island. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#68:6> Opponents fear it will destroy val <l> uable wildlife habitat and

poison waters with mercury generated by rotting vegetation. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#69:6> " The white collar terrorism prac <l> tised by Mr. Robinson is a

national scandal," Saganash told a news con <l> ference. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#70:6> " We're asking for the resignation of Mr. Robinson and the

resignation of ( federal Environment Minister) Robert de Cotret because these

peo <l> ple are no longer capable of assum <l> ing their responsibilities for

the pro <l> tection of the environment," he said, flanked by two lawyers.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#71:6> Environmental activists were also upset. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#72:6> " We are quite distressed," said Helene Lajambe, a spokesman for

the James Bay Committee, a fledg <l> ling environmental group that op <l>

poses expansion of the existing James Bay 1 complex. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#73:6> " They've opened the door to a fast-track process for Quebec

Hydro and they don't want to admit it," said Jim Fulton, the New Democrat

environment critic.
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#74:6> " The political fix is in." </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#75:6> Liberal environment critic Paul Martin said the federal

government clearly has jurisdiction over the project in spite of the 1975

James Bay Agreement. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#76:6> " There really is considerable doubt whether this government has

any backbone," he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#77:6> De Cotret said the federal govern <l> ment can't prevent Quebec

from building related structures before the environmental study of the dam is

finished. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#78:6> " You can't stop any province from building a road if it's

environmen <l> tally safe," he said outside the Com <l> mons. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#79:6> Saganash said he will consult with the 10,000 Cree of Northern

Quebec before deciding how to battle this latest setback in a fight to stop

the giant hydro project. </p> </I>

<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#80:7> <h> <bold> Rae mindful of deepening recession </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#81:7> <bold> By Laura Eggertson </bold>
<ICE-CAN:W2C-008#82:7> The Canadian Press

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#83:7> TORONTO - Ontario's first NDP government reheated its campaign

menu yesterday in a speech from the throne that promised to be mindful of a

deepening recession. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#84:7> Premier Bob Rae repeated elec <l> tion promises for a new

driver-owned automobile insurance plan, wage protection for laid-off workers

and a moratorium on constructing new nuclear plants. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#85:7> But he also outlined the tough economic conditions facing his gov

<l> ernment, already burdened with a &dollar;2.5-billion deficit. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#86:7> " To come in after six weeks and announce 'Whammo' we're going to

spend here and spend there ... that would be irresponsible," Rae said before

entering the provincial legis <l> lature. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#87:7> Before about 500 spectators, in <l> cluding extra seats packed

into the chamber for invited guests such as Rae's father, Saul, and Rae's

wife, Arlene Perly, Lt.-Gov Lincoln Alex <l> ander read the 17-page document

with dramatic flare. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#88:7> " My government will open Queen's Park to those who have never

before had an effective voice in the corridors of power," Rae pledged in the

speech, met with courteous attention from the house's 130 members. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#89:7> The government also plans to in <l> troduce an environmental bill

of rights giving people the power to sue polluters and a safe drinking water

act, he said. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#90:7> The NDP will keep its commit <l> ment to legislating a common

pause day once the Ontario Court of Appeal has delivered its ruling on Sunday

shopping. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#91:7> As expected, Rae said he will scrap the Liberal government's

no-fault auto insurance system this spring. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#92:7> But he gave few details of the new plan, which Financial

Institutions Minister Peter Kormos said would include a role for insurance

brokers and could be delivered in conjunc <l> tion with an existing

corporation. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#93:7> The halt to planning further nucle <l> ar stations - plants Hydro

said it needs to meet growing demands for electricity - means the giant

utility will reallocate &dollar;240 million to con <l> servation, Rae said.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#94:7> Measures for workers will include legislation requiring more

notice of plant closures and a previously an <l> nounced fund to help pay

vacation and severance benefits for employ <l> ees of bankrupt companies.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#95:7> The government will also gradual <l> ly raise the minimum wage,

cur <l> rently at &dollar;5.40 an hour, to within 60 per cent of the average

industrial wage. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#96:7> The initiatives closely follow the New <w> Democrats' </w>

more-specific &dollar;2-billion Agenda for the People, a list of policy

platforms released during the summer election campaign that brought the NDP

unexpectedly to power. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2C-008#97:7> But the throne speech failed to set the new government apart,

Liberal Opposition Leader Bob Nixon charged during a news conference. </p>
