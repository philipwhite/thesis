<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#1:1> Dear <@> Jude </@> : </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#2:1> How are you?
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#3:1> I hope that your work is interesting, but not driving you crazy. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#4:1> Montreal is a bilingual city, with French and English both used.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#5:1> However, there are many immigrants, so Creole, Spanish, Arabic and

Chinese are often spoken.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#6:1> It is a very vibrant city, with art, music, sports, <}> <-> etc </->

<+> et cetera </+> </}> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#7:1> It is situated on the <}> <-> St. </-> <+> Saint </+> </}> Lawrence

River, and is a big port.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#8:1> As an anglophone who can speak French it is <}> <-> ok </-> <+> okay

</+> </}> , but there is a great deal of tension between the separatists and

the federalists.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#9:1> I would not want to live here except to go to school because of the

tension. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#10:1> I am very busy with school.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#11:1> I am taking my MA in Teaching English.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#12:1> I am taking three graduate courses each semester, so I will be done

in August 1998.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#13:1> I have three projects right now: a dialect study of <@> Villageberg

</@> <}> <-> Co. </-> <+> County </+> </}> , <}> <-> N. S. </-> <+> Nova

Scotia </+> </}> , a contrastive study of English and Punjabi, and a study of

the effect of age on the ability to use a second language.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#14:1> I have tickets to go home by train on <}> <-> <.> Dec. </.> </-> <=>

December </=> </}> 16, after exams.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#15:1> It will take 20 hours. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#16:1> I have finally found a home church - it is an Anglican church,

St. James.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#17:1> I am also going to a Christian young people's group at university.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#18:1> The young people are nice.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#19:1> My health has been fair so far.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#20:1> I am learning to cook for myself.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#21:1> I have also made two cakes for meals at my Libyan <w> friends' </w>

houses and a pie for Thanksgiving dinner at my Jewish friends.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#22:1> I am far from being an expert, but I think that I am doing all right.

</p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#23:1> I am teaching a group of beginner English students for about 5

hours / week.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#24:1> They come from India, Afghanistan, Libya, Lebanon, Iran, and Korea.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#25:1> I enjoy them a great deal.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#26:1> I have just administered their first exam and they did well.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#27:1> One lady even made me a birthday cake.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#28:1> My Libyan friends also made me a birthday cake on my actual birthday.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#29:1> Needless to say, I was well taken care of! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#30:1> I am hoping to come home to <}> <-> N. S. </-> <+> Nova Scotia

</+> </}> for the summer, so that I can take a couple of summer courses.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#31:1> I would also like to spend some time with my family and friends.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#32:1> I miss Nova Scotia.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#33:1> As I live in a bachelor apartment on the twelfth floor of a large

building in the downtown core, I see a lot of concrete.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#34:1> I miss the green of Nova Scotia. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#35:1> This week from Thursday to Sunday I was housesitting for my

Jewish friends, the <@> Cherneskys </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#36:1> They had me over for Thanksgiving.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#37:1> I had a wonderful turkey dinner, and it was nice not to have to spend

the holiday alone.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#38:1> I kept an eye on their 15-year-old, who is very bright. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#39:1> Dad is hoping to come up from <}> <-> <.> Nov. </.> </-> <=>

November </=> </}> 1 to 4.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#40:1> Mom also wanted to come, but she has been quite sick.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#41:1> It will be great to see him. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#42:1> Anyway, I miss you a great deal, and write soon!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#43:1> Love, </p> </I>


<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#44:2> Dear Mom, Dad and <@> Sue </@> : </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#45:2> I am very busy, but I'm doing well. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#46:2> I am very pleased with my supervisor's decision to divide my

class into two groups.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#47:2> I now teach the faster group, with only six people.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#48:2> We are doing parts of the body this week.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#49:2> I like being able to move more quickly with the students. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#50:2> My Christian fellowship group is very enjoyable.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#51:2> There are about 20 of us, and it is SO nice to have people who

understand my background and my choices.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#52:2> We had a table at the multi-faith festival this week; and it was very

good to answer questions about my faith.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#53:2> There is a Bible study on <}> <-> <.> Wed </.> </-> <=> Wednesday

</=> </}> mornings which I would like to go to.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#54:2> We often have meetings on Friday nights.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#55:2> This Friday we are having a potluck.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#56:2> Since I am not a great cook; I will bring Timbits!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#57:2> It is always a good time of song, worship and conversation.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#58:2> We have prayer every weekday, and after I went to prayer yesterday, I

went out to dinner with <@> Carla </@> ; the person in charge of the prayer

ministry.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#59:2> She is also an ESL teacher, and she plans to go to Tunisia.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#60:2> We are having a pancake supper on Shrove Tuesday, and then on Ash

Wednesday I have church.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#61:2> I suppose I should give something up for Lent! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#62:2> I don't know what I will be doing this summer.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#63:2> I have written my supervisor in Ottawa to say that I would love to

come back this summer.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#64:2> I have also applied to work at the tent on Parliament Hill and at

Rideau Hall.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#65:2> I'll let you know what happens! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#66:2> I have heard from <@> Heather </@> in Waterloo, and I hope to go

to see her for a few days over the break.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#67:2> I also would like to visit <@> Olga </@> , but I have to find out if

she is well enough.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#68:2> However, <@> Heather </@> may also come here, as she has family in

Montreal.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#69:2> I will let you know how it goes! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#70:2> Happy Valentine's Day, my dears!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#71:2> I'm thinking of you! Love, </p> </I>


<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#72:3> Dear <@> Lynn </@> : </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#73:3> Thanks for the letter!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#74:3> It was so nice to get your news.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#75:3> I am settling back into school again.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#76:3> <@> Collegial </@> 's a big school - 20,000 students - which is twice

the size of my old school, <@> Majorca </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#77:3> There are 70 people in the grad school of my <}> <-> <.> dept. </.>

</-> <=> department </=> </}> , and so I don't know them all.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#78:3> However, I have some friends.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#79:3> I received my marks - all A's - so I hope that I will be able to keep

my fellowship:
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#80:3> However, I will find out in May.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#81:3> I will hopefully graduate in November 1998, and after that, I would

like to go abroad to teach English.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#82:3> There is a program in Finland that I am interested in, but I may also

go to Korea or Japan.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#83:3> My classes are very interesting.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#84:3> I have a class in grammar instruction, and I have to do an oral

presentation on how to coordinate grammar instruction with stages of

psychological readiness.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#85:3> I also have a course on reflective teaching.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#86:3> Every week, starting this weekend, I have to write a l0-page paper

<}> <-> crtiquing </-> <+> critiquing </+> </}> my teaching technique.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#87:3> My only big weakness is that I don't get the students to do as much

group work as they could.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#88:3> I also have a class on bilingualism.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#89:3> I hope to do a study on the loss of traditional vocabulary items in

the maternal side of my family. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#90:3> My students are doing well.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#91:3> I have 17, but the class will be split in two starting this week.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#92:3> I am not sure if I will get the slower group, or if I will get the

more advanced group.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#93:3> I have to wait until Monday to see what will happen.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#94:3> This week the students will learn how to use calendars.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#95:3> It should be interesting. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#96:3> On Saturday I went with my friend <@> Lara </@> to <@> Greaser

</@> 's, a <w> fifties' </w> style diner.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#97:3> I had chicken souvlaki, which was great.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#98:3> We talked for six hours, and then we went back to her house and

talked until 5:30 a.m.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#99:3> It is very rare to meet someone who is so interesting.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#100:3> As <@> Lara </@> is Muslim, she is observing Ramadan this month, and

so can't eat during the day.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#101:3> I slept at her place until 10:30 a.m., but then I left to go to

church.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#102:3> Needless to say, I was slightly fried! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#103:3> On Wednesday I manned the Christian fellowship table at the

multi-faith celebration at the university.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#104:3> Some people asked me very hard questions about God and Christianity,

and it was a good experience to answer their questions.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#105:3> I may go out to Christian fellowship tonight; but I guess it will

depend on the weather. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#106:3> This weekend I have church and the paper on my students, plus A

LOT of reading.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#107:3> I have a break from <}> <-> <.> Feb. </.> </-> <=> February </=>

</}> 14 - 23.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#108:3> I will probably not go back to Nova Scotia, but I may either visit

my friend, <@> Heather </@> , in Waterloo, or she may visit me here.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#109:3> Oh, well!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#110:3> I'll figure it out eventually! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#111:3> Thanks so much for the lovely pictures, and all my love to you,

the children and <@> Dave </@> ! Love, </p> </I>


<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#112:4> Dear <@> Lynn </@> : </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#113:4> Thanks for the letter!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#114:4> I'm glad that you are doing well.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#115:4> Your work, church and academic activities sound interesting, but

time-consuming!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#116:4> I'm leaving this afternoon for the break.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#117:4> I can hardly wait to surprise my family in Nova Scotia!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#118:4> While I am at home, I will do research on attitudes towards

dialects.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#119:4> The 19 hours on the train will be long, but I look forward to seeing

all my family and friends.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#120:4> I am applying to work in the tourist industry this summer in Ottawa,

so I may not get home until next <}> <-> <.> Xmas </.> </-> <=> Christmas

</=> </}> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#121:4> Thus I am taking this opportunity when I can! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#122:4> I was very busy this week.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#123:4> I talked about the " family" with my class of immigrants.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#124:4> I had to explain about remarriage, step-families, and half-siblings;

all of which were a little shocking for most of my students.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#125:4> On Shrove Tuesday I went to a lovely pancake supper with maple syrup

and sausages.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#126:4> I sat next to a lovely couple who have just moved to Montreal from

Hong Kong, as well as a lovely older lady who does cross-country skiing and

badminton!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#127:4> I feel lazy in comparsion.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#128:4> On Ash <}> <-> <.> Wed. </.> </-> <=> Wednesday </=> </}> I went to

church to receive the ashes.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#129:4> I have decided to give up chocolate for Lent.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#130:4> It is a big sacrifice, but it will make my chocolate Easter bunny

even sweeter!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#131:4> On Thursday, I had a VERY busy day.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#132:4> I went to a pronunciation clinic put on for the teachers in my

program, and it is very interesting to see how to help students pronounce

correctly.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#133:4> I then went to prayer meeting at my youth group.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#134:4> I will miss a lot of activities this month, as I will be travelling,

but I really enjoy the young people.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#135:4> I also consulted my advisor, who helped me put the final touches on

my questionnaire for the project I will be working on in Nova Scotia.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#136:4> Today I finished a paper that is due the day after I get back in

Montreal from the trip. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#137:4> Best wishes, and I hope that you write soon! Love, </p> </I>


<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#138:5> Dear <@> Natalie </@> : </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#139:5> Thank you so much for the letter!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#140:5> I understand completely about missing your family and friends.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#141:5> The theatre experience sounds wonderful.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#142:5> I'm glad that you are seeing the sites! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#143:5> I had a nice time home with my parents.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#144:5> I managed to get some of the research done that I needed, and I also

saw many of my old friends, even though not enough!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#145:5> I went out to dinner and to see " Jerry Maguire" with <@> Jessica

</@> , my friend, and we talked about next year.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#146:5> She is hoping to go either to Europe or Australia / New Zealand to

work and travel.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#147:5> She has also been published in a geology magazine!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#148:5> I would be very tempted to go with her, but I have to finish off my

degree!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#149:5> On the way, back to Montreal, there was a big storm, and I was on

the train for 24 hours!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#150:5> I was very happy to get back to my own place. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#151:5> I have a lot of work to do.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#152:5> I have a take-home exam this week, and three papers and an oral

presentation on the go.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#153:5> I am also doing my teaching.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#154:5> Besides grammar, I also have to teach them a bit about Canadian

culture.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#155:5> It is a little overwhelming, being thought of as an " expert" on

Canada! </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#156:5> I am not sure what I will do this summer.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#157:5> If I am offered a job I may take it, but it is also possible that I

will just stay here and do summer school.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#158:5> I hope that <@> David </@> will come up in early April, which would

be great. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-010#159:5> Write soon, and keep up the great explorations!
<ICE-CAN:W1B-010#160:5> Love </p> </I>
