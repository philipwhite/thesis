completed by CUSO Field Staff and project / institution. </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#128:1> <h> 5.1 Provide a brief history of the project / institution. </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-006#129:1> The Politani started as a project in 1984, and in 1985 teaching

staff were sent on fellowships while the curricula were being developed.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#130:1> The educational activities of the Politani actually started in 1989.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#131:1> By 1993, the Politani expects to become independent from the

University system. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#132:1> <h> 5.2 What are the stated objectives of the project / institution?

</h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-006#133:1> The Politani in Kupang was set up to meet the demand for

practically trained technologists in agriculture.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#134:1> Graduates from the polytechnic are expected to fill the gaps between

workers from the vocational high schools who have been trained in specific

skills and the academic graduates from the universities. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-006#135:1> The aim of the three year, six semester course is to produce

graduates with a wide range of knowledge and skills, who will be useful in a

variety of jobs in the agricultural industry with minimal further training.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#136:1> The curriculum for each field of study is divided into two sections:

a core course of study covering the first three semesters, followed by a

further three semesters of advanced studies.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#137:1> The core studies aim to develop a broad understanding of Indonesian

agriculture while the advanced studies aim to provide graduates with an added

understanding of applied aspects in selected fields of study such as Food

Crops, Dryland Farming, and Animal Husbandry.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#138:1> These advanced studies have been selected as the most appropriate

for developing the region's agricultural practices. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#139:1> <h> 5.3 What have been the major achievements and problems of the

project / institution to date? </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-006#140:1> <ul> Achievements: </ul> <l> 1. The Politani has so far produced

230 graduates. 2. The Politani has developed extensive collaboration with

local and international NGOs, and government programs. 3. In 1993, the

Politani expects to become independent of the university system. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-006#141:1> <ul> Problems: </ul> <l> 1. The English capabilities of the

teaching staff are still very weak. 2. The teaching staff lack experience in

developing and using teaching aids with various media. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#142:1> <h> 5.4 What is the project / institution's major objective in

placing a cooperant? </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-006#143:1> 1 - To improve the English capabilities of the teaching staff; 2

- To assist teaching staff in developing teaching aids using various media; 3

- To help edit agriculture media produced by the Politani; 4 - To teach

English to partner NGO staff. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#144:1> <h> <bold> What is CUSO's objective? </bold> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#145:1> <h> <bold> Explain how job relates to CUSO's programming work in the

area? <bold> </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-006#146:1> CUSO's objective in placing a cooperant at the Politani is to

provide technical support to a number of key local institutions which play an

important role in uplands development in the Nusa Tenggara area of Indonesia

including the Politani.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#147:1> The Politani is not only an appropriate educational institution in

which to place a TESL cooperant but also, as mentioned above, the Politani is

the only post secondary agricultural education institution in the province

which provides college level skills of a practical nature focusing on dryland

farming systems.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#148:1> The Politani also plays a key role in collaborating with local NGOs

and appropriate government institutions on important issues such as dryland

farming systems, agro-forestry, social forestry, conservation, etc.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#149:1> As such CUSO considers the Politani a strategic institution to

support as it will continue to play a long term role in the above stated

sustainable development issue. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#150:1> <h> 5.5 How does this placement relate to both the strategic and

practical needs of women?
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#151:1> Does the project / institution utilize a women in development or

gender relations framework for planning its activities? </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-006#152:1> At present, only 5 of the 43 teaching staff are women ( 12%),

and only 30% of the students enrolled are women.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#153:1> Another 40% of the administrative and technical staff are women.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#154:1> While the representation of women in the teaching staff Is low, the

cooperant can still play a strategic role in improving the present female

teaching staff capabilities in English.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#155:1> At a broader level, the politani addresses the needs of both women

and male farmers in NTT.
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#156:1> The degree to which this is supported by a women in development or

gender relations framework is still weak. </p>
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#157:1> <h> 5.6 List duties of cooperant. </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W2D-006#158:1> Identify primary and secondary responsibilities <ul> in order of

priority </ul> .
<ICE-CAN:W2D-006#159:1> If cooperant is expected to train an individual or group explain

this role carefully. </p> </I>
