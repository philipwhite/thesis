<I>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#1:1> So over procedures <,> it's a question of attitude
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#2:1> Attitude from police officers from social workers from judges
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#3:1> Uhh you know we've had bad examples over the uhh last couple of years

were judges didn't think it was important
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#4:1> Uhh so uhh <}> <-> it's a </-> <=> the community </=> </}> as a whole

has to ah realize that this is a big issue
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#5:1> And we have to work on it

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#6:1:A> And yet we've just been through a week where four women found

murdered
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#7:1:A> Uh two of them apparently conjugal violence
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#8:1:A> The others perhaps conjugal violence

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#9:1:B> mhm <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#10:1:B> Yeah but it should be enough to make people realize that there's a

lot of violence in this society
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#11:1:B> And that you know <,> every person in this society can make a

difference by not accepting uhh the roots of violence
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#12:1:B> <}> <-> And </-> <=> and </=> </}> if you see kids uhh going

through problems and solving these problem through violence it's your job as

a parent as a teacher <}> <-> as </-> <=> as </=> </}> a neighbour uhh to get

involved
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#13:1:B> Uhh to make sure that in ten years from now uhh adults won't be

solving problems with violence still

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#14:1:A> Mister <@> Babineau </@> thanks for joining this morning

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#24:2:B> Well uhm I don't know
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#25:2:B> The people have been getting <,> letters

<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#27:2:B> Community groups who represent thousands of people <,> have come

out against it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#28:2:B> I mean people have to say our library <,> our places where <,> <}>

<-> we </-> <=> we're </=> </}> helped uh we help immigrants fit into our our

society
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#29:2:B> We can't judge them on the number of books <,> borrowed
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#30:2:B> And uhh maybe N D G needs double the budget than other

<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#51:2:A> That's <@> Hannah Walkerton </@> with the friends of Benny Library

</I>


<I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#52:3:A> What do the scientists hope will happen later today

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#53:3:B> <O> Deep breath </O> They're hoping that the spacecraft will

survive
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#54:3:B> That it will make the plunge into Jupiter
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#55:3:B> It's coming in like a comet
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#56:3:B> It has to endure <}> <-> <.> intra </.> </-> <=> incredible </=>

</}> temperatures
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#57:3:B> Uh the heat of friction as it slows down incredible forces uh

acting on it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#58:3:B> Then they're hoping that the parachute will open <,> the

instruments will work and we'll begin to get data
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#59:3:B> They're also hoping that the second part of the Galileo spacecraft

will put itself into orbit where it will remain for the next two years

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#60:3:A> And what are they hoping to find out

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#61:3:B> This is the first time that a spacecraft has ever <,> touched

<,> <}> <-> one of what are called </-> <=> one of what are called </=> </}>

the gas giant planets
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#62:3:B> Jupiter is more like a star then a planet
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#63:3:B> It's made of hydrogen and helium
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#64:3:B> The same stuff as the sun
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#65:3:B> And because of that <,> they are hoping they're able to see a piece

of what the solar system used to look like
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#66:3:B> Jupiter hasn't changed in over four billion years
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#67:3:B> It's still made of the same primordial material that the entire

solar system <,> including the earth was made of and because its so primative

that in a way looking at Jupiter is like looking back in time
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#68:3:B> So they're very excited about that </I>


<I>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#69:4:B> And it became apparent that <}> <-> if </-> <=> if </=> </}>

our soldiers were going to defend that position it would be totally untenable
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#70:4:B> They would not have been able to do it
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#71:4:B> So after some uh fairly stubborn resistance and some heated

conversation and debate uh orders were issued by the commander <,> that uh

they were to leave with the uh Croatian soldiers
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#72:4:B> So <,> had they tried to stay <}> <-> I </-> <=> I </=> </}> think

the tune would've been different uh but uh there was no point in the face of

the overwhelming odds <}> <-> to uh </-> <=> to </=> </}> stay there uhm any

longer so they were forced to leave

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#73:4:A> <}> <-> What uh </-> <=> you were saying </=> </}> the

negotiations are well under way though to get them to Rastovic?

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#74:4:B> Yes it's not really negotiation it's simply a question uh
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#75:4:B> There're still uh a lot of Croatian troops moving in the area

obviously they wish to control the roads
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#76:4:B> So it's more a question of scheduling uh to get them through
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#77:4:B> Under escort <}> <-> you just </-> <=> uh if you're owning the

battlefield which the Croatians do <,> </=> </}> you just don't want uhm you

know unknown groups of people travelling around in vehicles

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#78:4:A> Is there a danger in going through that area?

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#79:4:B> Not at this stage
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#80:4:B> Uh the Croatians very much control it uh <}> <-> they uh </-> <=>

they are </=> </}> in <,> the Bankovac uh town of Bankovac which is about

four kilometres from Rastovic which was a Serbian stronghold
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#81:4:B> Uh we see now uh Croatian civilians who had lived originally in the

Krajina in the houses in and around Rastovic and around where the Canadian

soldiers are stationed <,> returning now to uh reclaim their homes
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#82:4:B> They have paperwork that shows they were in fact their homes
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#83:4:B> And so we have a lot of movement of civilian populations in the

area
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#84:4:B> We have a number of uh refugees that have come to uh the camp at

Rastovic uh for succour looking for uh uh water and food and that sort of

thing <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> a bit of protection from the <}> <->

<.> U </.> </-> <=> United </=> </}> Nations to make sure that <,> uh they're

well looked after
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#85:4:B> So <}> <-> there's </-> <=> there is </=> </}> always some

confusion in a battlefield area uh immediately afterwards and that's what

we're seeing right now
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#86:4:B> So our soldiers are patrolling the area trying to make sure that

there are no uh live rounds lying around because there was a lot of artillery

barrages <}> <-> and uh </-> <=> and </=> </}> that sort of thing

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#87:4:A> What's the situation you mentioned refugees are there many of

them at this point? <{> <[> coming to your <?> soldiers </?> </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#88:4:B> <[> uh </[> </{> there are not as many as we uh might have

expected initially but uh we had I think at last count was nineteen <}> <->

<.> l </.> </-> <=> that </=> </}> stayed last night near our camp in

Rastovic
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#89:4:B> But there's also as I mentioned a lot of Croatian people who are

coming back to reclaim their homes and move into the area
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#90:4:B> So there's still quite a bit of movement
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#91:4:B> There's a lot of uh military movement in the area
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#92:4:B> And so uh it's just uh as I say with respect to the forty-three

it's simply a question of scheduling and making a mutually convenient time

that they can use the roads
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#93:4:B> There are very very few roads in the area so uh traffic clogs them

very quickly

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#94:4:A> <}> <-> <.> I </.> Is there </-> <=> Have </=> </}> we sort of

turned a corner here now that the Croatians have recaptured some of the

territory?
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#95:4:A> Um does this change the peacekeeping mission?

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#96:4:B> Oh absolutely
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#97:4:B> Uh it is no longer uh two sides with <}> <-> a </-> <=> a </=> </}>

clear demarcation line between the two of them
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#98:4:B> It is now the sovereign state of Croatia
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#99:4:B> They are firmly in control uh certainly down in our area
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#100:4:B> Uh and so I would suspect that uh the United Nations authorities

in consultation with Croatian authorities will be coming up with some form of

<}> <-> an </-> <=> either a </=> </}> new mandate or a change to the current

mandate or in fact even an end to the current mandate
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#101:4:B> And I think uh that is something <?> that </?> <}> <-> will </->

<=> will </=> </}> be uh on the uh Security Council's table this morning
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#102:4:B> Uh and I think very soon we will probably receive uh new direction

as to exactly what to do
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#103:4:B> In the meantime there is a tremendous humanitarian mission that is

available here
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#104:4:B> Uh there are lots and lots of refugees moving about in the area
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#105:4:B> Uh there are Croatians migrating back in to take over their town
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#106:4:B> So there's a constant movement of civilians
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#107:4:B> And with that uh and of course war brings a lack of food a lack of

water <,> uh that type of thing <{> <[> so I think that </[>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#108:4:B> The humanitarian side is <}> <-> the </-> <=> the </=> </}>

biggest issue right now

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#109:4:A> <[> You're trying to provide for them </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#110:4:A> Thank you very much for speaking with us <,> this morning

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#113:5:A> The summer barbeque can be followed by a horror <,> called

<}> <-> barbeque </-> <=> Hamburger </=> </}> Disease <,> intestinal cramps

and much worse
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#114:5:A> The bacterium that causes it <,> is a particular type of e coli

which is found in the intestines of animals <,> and so it's not uncommon in

store-bought meat
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#115:5:A> Trouble is that ten percent of children who get hamburger disease

<,> can go on to develop serious kidney disease
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#116:5:A> <@> Janelle Irving </@> is the national coordinator of a large

study just completed by the Canadian Paediatric Kidney Disease Research

Centre in Ottawa and she's on the line now this morning
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#117:5:A> Good morning

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#118:5:B> Good morning <@> Jim </@>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#119:5:A> Ah the research centre is planning to publish results from an

extensive <,> three year study <,> it conducted involving hundreds of

Canadian children and uh they were diagnosed with so-called Hamburger Disease
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#120:5:A> how did these <,> kids <,> get the disease?

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#121:5:B> Well <@> Jim </@> <}> <-> there's </-> <=> there's </=> </}>

several ways that you can come into contact with Hamburger Disease although

our nickname uhm being <}> <-> that it </-> <=> that would </=> </}> make one

think it comes from eating undercooked hamburger <&> minced meat </&>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#122:5:B> That is quite true although <,> in addition person to person

spread is really the number one ah risk factor involved with this infection

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#123:5:A> So it's food-borne?

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#124:5:B> Yep that's exactly right

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#125:5:A> And that has the bacteria and usually <}> <-> if </-> <=> if

</=> </}> it's undercooked <}> <-> that's </-> <=> that's </=> </}> a tip-off

right?

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#126:5:B> Exactly <}> <-> if you uhm if </-> <=> if you think </=> </}>

about <}> <-> your uhm your </-> <=> your </=> </}> kitchens <}> <-> for </->

<=> for </=> </}> a minute and preparing hamburgers for the barbeque at this

time of year <,> we can't see this bacteria in the ground beef <,>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#127:5:B> And of course most of us uhm myself included use our hands to

prepare these hamburger patties
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#128:5:B> Uh if the bacteria is there and if you are not <,> really really

uh conscious of washing your hands well with warm soapy water <,> after you

have <,> handled the ground beef before you come into contact with your

family members <,> or before you go on to prepare the salad as the next part

of your meal <,> you really are risking spreading that bacteria within your

kitchen

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#129:5:A> So this is uh a significant finding in the study <}> <-> that

</-> <=> that </=> </}> you can get it also through personal contact <{> <[>

Right </[> ?

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#130:5:B> <[> Exactly </[> </{>
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#131:5:B> It's a very important finding and it's one really that uhm you

know when we first started working in this area <,> uhm that really we were

not as acutely aware of as we are now

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#132:5:A> We're not washing our hands enough are we?

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#133:5:B> We're not

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#134:5:A> Now I read about an outbreak uh of the e coli <}> <-> in </->

<=> in </=> </}> New <{1> <[1> England
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#135:5:A> People </[1> who'd been drinking apple cider <}> <-> from </-> <=>

you can get sick </=> </}> from cider?

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#137:5:B> <[1> Mmm </[1> </{1>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#138:5:B> <[2> Yes </[2> </{2>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#139:5:B> Yes you can and <}> <-> this has actually been </-> <=> this

is not </=> </}> the first outbreak to be reported linked to apple cider
<ICE-CAN:S1B-050#140:5:B> The problem there uhm <@> Jim </@> what happens is <}> <-> the

</-> <=> the </=> </}> apples that are selected if you like for fresh apple

cider this is the road or farm stand apple cider that we're talking about <,>

uh is not necessarily picked directly from the apples from the trees these

are usually the ones that have fallen on the ground <,> that in fact have

been <,> contaminated or mixed in with the animal faeces or animal waste <}>

<-> that is </-> <=> that is </=> </}> sort of <{1> <[1> in the ground </[1>

for example manure <,>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1B-050#141:5:A> <[1> ohhh </[1> </{1> </I>
