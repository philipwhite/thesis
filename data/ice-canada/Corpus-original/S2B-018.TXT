<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#30:3:A> The P Q <&> <indig> Parti Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois </indig>

political party </&> says the reversal of referendum vote results in the

riding of Westmount is not electoral fraud
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#31:3:A> The vice-president of the party Monique Simard says the yes

committee is not at fault
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#32:3:A> <@> Janet Macdonald </@> reports

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-018#33:3:B> Simard said it was the result of a stupid mistake that caused

the yes <,> and no sides to be reversed in the Westmont riding
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#34:3:B> She says it wasn't the fault of the yes committee

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S2B-018#35:3:C> But it was <}> <-> an </-> <=> a </=> </}> stupid inversion

<,> that was even overlooked by the no side <,,> when it happened
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#36:3:C> But I presume <,> was corrected after by Mister Cote's <,> uh

counts

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-018#37:3:B> Simard says she doesn't blame Cote for the discrepancies in

the referendum results
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#38:3:B> She says Cote was ignored by airline companies and businesses <,>

when he warned them they were violating the referendum budget laws
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#39:3:B> Simard says even yes officials had some serious problems the night

of the referendum and the police were called in some instances

<$C> <ICE-CAN:S2B-018#40:3:C> Many many complaints on irregularities concerning <}> <-> uh

</-> <=> uh </=> </}> people that were impostors
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#41:3:C> That use another person's identity to vote
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#42:3:C> Uhm other people that would not <,,> uh respect a certain number of

rules
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#43:3:C> So I think that ahh it's important that <,> people know <,,> that

there are complaints everywhere <,,> on a certain number of things

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S2B-018#44:3:B> Simard says Cote is the only one who can take any action in

dealing with the discrepancies
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#45:3:B> She says some fifty complaints made by the national yes committee

will be made public tomorrow
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#46:3:B> Today is the deadline for a recount of the referendum results by

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-018#53:3:A> Bourbeau says the P Q government is reluctant to make the

necessary cuts in the civil service because union leaders had supported the

sovereignist cause
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#54:3:A> Government officials say the cuts amount to a billion dollar loss

<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#69:4:D> And we get the name <,,> of the car bomb <,> victim this morning

<,,> in Chateauguay
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#70:4:D> Good afternoon
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#71:4:D> <@> George Fraser </@> with news and comments at high noon <,,> on

a day that is really <,> not bad <,> not bad
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#72:4:D> It's not exactly hot yet <,> uh but it's getting there
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#73:4:D> It is warming up
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#74:4:D> It was below freezing in parts of the Laurentiens this morning
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#75:4:D> So it's uh mostly <,> sunny
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#76:4:D> There's a bit of cloud but mostly sunny downtown
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#77:4:D> A bit breezy but not like yesterday
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#78:4:D> And the tempurature has moved up to thirteen degrees downtown
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#79:4:D> <?> Be </?> a little cooler than that <,> where you are but uh not

<,> bad <,> at all
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#80:4:D> However <,,> we will get some cloud <,> later on today <,> and

Thursday doesn't look too good
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#81:4:D> Not a bad week though
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#82:4:D> Meantime <,,> the car bomb this morning
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#83:4:D> It happened at about six fifteen
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#84:4:D> A bomb exploded <,,> killing a man driving a car <,> around

Saint-Francis street in Chateauguay
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#85:4:D> Right by the <,> Zellers store there
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#86:4:D> We now know his name
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#87:4:D> His name was <@> Gord Andrew </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#88:4:D> A N D <,> R E W
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#89:4:D> He was thirty-five years old
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#90:4:D> But <,,> police say they know nothing about him
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#91:4:D> He had no record <,> whatsoever
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#92:4:D> He was not <,> known <,> to police
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#93:4:D> So the victim of the car bombing <,> in Chateauguay this morning

<,> <@> Gord Andrew </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#94:4:D> But all we know about him so far is that he's thirty-five or was

thirty-five and did not have a police record
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#95:4:D> Meantime <,,> in the Laval Courthouse this morning the <,>

resumption of the inquest into the death of <@> Micheal Como </@>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#96:4:D> You may recall it was just about a year ago <,> May thirty-first

last year that <@> Como </@> was shot <,> and killed by <,> a police officer

in Montreal
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#97:4:D> He was suspect <,> in a shoplifting incident
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#98:4:D> And uhm the story is that the gun went off accidently <,> when <@>

Como </@> was on the ground <,> uh being apprehended by <,> police
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#99:4:D> Uh the ambulance technician who was uh on the witness stand this

morning <,> said that when he got there <@> Como </@> was <,> alive but had a

very <,> weak pulse
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#100:4:D> And of course he died <,> shortly afterwards
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#101:4:D> And we have a new picture to look at <,> in connection with the

murder of Police Constable <@> Raymond Gagnon </@> who as you know was

murdered <,> in Senneville recently
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#102:4:D> The new picture is a picture of a man robbing a bank of Montreal
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#103:4:D> There's now some reason to believe that he escaped <,> in a car

that may <,> have been the same car <,> that was the car that <@> Raymond

Gagnon </@> stopped in Senneville when he was shot <,> and killed
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#104:4:D> So <,> that <,> picture is now being published and police are

asking <,> all of our listeners and all Montrealers to take a look at the

picture <,> and see if it might be <,,> somebody <,> that they recognize
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#105:4:D> Politics
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#106:4:D> Well <,,> would there ever be a day in Quebec where we didn't have

politics I ask you
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#107:4:D> But of course of course of course
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#108:4:D> And so the politics continue
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#109:4:D> Jean Chr&eacute;tien saying that he's sorry that Lucien Bouchard

has cancelled his meeting with the Prime Minister for next week but he hopes

that they can get together soon <,> and that they can talk about working

together to make <,> Canada <,> work
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#110:4:D> Not a whole lot of hope of that at the moment mind you
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#111:4:D> The census
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#112:4:D> This is a census day in Canada
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#113:4:D> Everybody in Canada <,,> eleven million housholds involved <,>

supposed to fill out the form <,,> and send it in today to Ottawa
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#114:4:D> Uh most people got a short form that only takes a few minutes to

fill out
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#115:4:D> Some <,,> got a longer form which takes quite a while to fill out

as my wife and I found out last night
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#116:4:D> A lot of questions on that long form which we <,,> were unlucky

enough to get <,> I guess
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#117:4:D> Conference Board of Canada <,> says the next twelve months uh the

economy is going to weaken from west to east
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#118:4:D> In other words <,> very good in British Columbia not bad in the

west fairly good in Ontario <,> not very good in Quebec and even less <,>

good going east from Quebec with the worst place to be <,> being Newfoundland
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#119:4:D> And those <,> refugees <,> who have been on a boat <,,> a

desperate terrible boat <,> about four thousand of them <,> from uh the

Liberian capital finally have been <,> accepted as refugees <,> in Ghana
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#120:4:D> Many of them are so terribly sick <,> that they might not even

survive
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#121:4:D> C J A D News time is uh twelve oh five
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#122:4:D> At ten o'clock this morning the coldest place in the country was

Yellowknife
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#123:4:D> Uh it was minus <,> seven
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#124:4:D> The warmest was a tie <,> between Winnipeg and Portage La Prarie
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#125:4:D> They both had thirteen
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#126:4:D> Which is where we are now in downtown Montreal
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#127:4:D> But that was uh at ten o'clock our time
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#128:4:D> It was raining <,,> unusual eh <,> in Vancouver and Victoria
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#129:4:D> Snowing in Fort McMurray and Grande Prarie Alberta
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#130:4:D> Snowing also in Peace River
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#131:4:D> Raining in Prince Albert Saskatchewan
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#132:4:D> And that's it

at all </I>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S2B-018#134:5:A> <}> <-> And the White House </-> <=> you know we've had all

the controversy here about the gay rights amendment </=> </}> well the White

House <,> says ah <quote> President Clinton opposes same-sex marriage and may

sign a bill to outlaw it </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#135:5:A> Uh Press Secretary Mike McCurry <,> says Clinton believes <quote>

this is a time to strengthen the American family </quote>
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#136:5:A> The bill would make the definition of marriage as only a legal

union between one man and one woman <,> and he would make that a part of

federal law in the United States
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#137:5:A> The word <mention> spouse </mention> would be legally defined <,>

as being a person of the opposite <,> sex <,> only
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#138:5:A> Clinton's on record since nineteen ninety-two as opposing same-sex

<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#146:5:A> Scientists are hailing <,> the result of a small trial <,> of an

experimental text for Alzheimer's Disease
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#147:5:A> They say the results are accurate so far but hurdles have to be

overcome before the test can go into wide <,> clinical use
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#148:5:A> Nevertheless the test <,> seems to have worked out very well
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#149:5:A> It uses skin and blood cultures <,> and measures D N A damage <,>

in the body
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#150:5:A> It correctly pinpointed all twenty-seven Alzheimer's patient <,>

in an initial study
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#151:5:A> Identifying both the early onset kind of Alzheimers and the more

common form that comes later <,> in life
<ICE-CAN:S2B-018#152:5:A> So far doctors can't do much for patients with Alzheimer's as

probably you know <,> but a correct diagnosis helps rule out other causes of

dementia that can be treated
