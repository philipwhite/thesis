<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-032#172:1:A> Next day I'm sitting on the bus
<ICE-CAN:S1A-032#173:1:A> There are these two women <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-032#174:1:A> One probably in her early forties
<ICE-CAN:S1A-032#175:1:A> One in her early fifties <,,>
<ICE-CAN:S1A-032#176:1:A> And <,> the first person goes <O> laugh </O> well I mean <,,> just

because they <,> got up on that show and tried to pretend they're normal I

mean they're not normal <,,> they're not normal

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-032#177:1:B> Mm hmm

couldn't </=> </}> believe it
<ICE-CAN:S1A-032#179:1:A> They're sitting there trying to tell us how normal they are
<ICE-CAN:S1A-032#180:1:A> They're just not normal and that's not a normal marriage
<ICE-CAN:S1A-032#181:1:A> I don't I'm sorry that's not a normal marriage
<ICE-CAN:S1A-032#182:1:A> <}> <-> And </-> <=> <,> And </=> </}> <,> just prior to that I

had heard the beginning of their conversation or the end of the other

conversation which was all about the Paul Bernardo <,> trial

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-032#183:1:B> Now <}> <-> that </-> <=> that </=> </}> wasn't <O> laugh

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-032#188:1:A> And anyway then they started talking all about Michael

Jackson <}> <-> and </-> <=> and </=> </}> you know I'm sorry but that

make-up and everything
<ICE-CAN:S1A-032#189:1:A> I mean this person he's not normal he's not normal
<ICE-CAN:S1A-032#190:1:A> And <,,> at first I'm just kind of like discretely listening
<ICE-CAN:S1A-032#191:1:A> Trying to look out the window
<ICE-CAN:S1A-032#192:1:A> But eventually I found them so fascinating <,> that I turn and I

just looked at them blatantly
<ICE-CAN:S1A-032#193:1:A> I'm just <{> <[> looking at them going </[>

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-032#194:1:B> <[> You watched it </[> </{> <,> ya

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-032#202:1:A> And then <}> <-> I thought </-> <=> and I also thought </=>

</}> well <,,> these are the kind of people who will sit there <}> <-> and

</-> <=> and </=> </}> you know just decide all sorts of things about whether

going is it really so normal
<ICE-CAN:S1A-032#204:1:A> Like <,> if they were me looking at them what would they see

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-032#205:1:B> Mm hmm

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-032#206:1:A> And would they <,> think that that's so normal
<ICE-CAN:S1A-032#207:1:A> To be so completely involved in the lives of all these celebrity

<$B> <ICE-CAN:S1A-032#208:1:B> <[> Mm hmm </[> </{>

<$A> <ICE-CAN:S1A-032#209:1:A> And then on the other hand I had to go well I guess it is
