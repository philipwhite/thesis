<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#1:1> Dear Sir or Madam: </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#2:1> I would like to apply for the position of English Language Program

Director which was advertised in the Toronto Globe and Mail this October,

1995.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#3:1> I have been working in the area of adult ESL/EFL and ESP for 10 years,

both in Winnipeg and in Zaire, Africa.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#4:1> In Zaire I worked as Teacher Training Coordinator training new

teachers, observing and evaluating teaching staff, ordering and developing

program-specific materials, organizing a reference library for teachers, and

conducting <w> teachers' </w> workshops.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#5:1> I have a Master's degree in Teaching English as a Second Language with

a specialization in Curriculum Development.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#6:1> I have taught and developed programs for general ESL and EFL, as well

as more specialized classes such as settlement language for non-confident

learners and seniors, English for business professionals, for foreign

students preparing to study in North America, and for factory workers.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#7:1> In each of the more specialized programs I was responsible for

developing assessment tools and tests as well as specific curricula for each

program. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#8:1> As a teacher trainer I enjoy providing leadership in a

facilitative manner, learning from, and capitalizing on, the strengths of

each individual in a given group.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#9:1> I work well under the pressure of time constraints and highly value

and enjoy cross-cultural experience. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#10:1> Although most of my teaching experience has been with adults, I

have been actively involved as a volunteer in my children's French Immersion

classes, and believe that my keen pedagogical interest in language learning

in primary education would assist me in transferring my knowledge of ESL

techniques and principles to primary and middle school years as well. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#11:1> Please find enclosed a copy of my resume, as well as a letter of

reference from the previous director of the <@> Zaire-American English

College </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#12:1> You may contact me at the address above, or by telephone at <@> (

555) 111-5077 </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#13:1> Thank you for your consideration. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#14:1> Sincerely, <@> Felicity Lunse </@> </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#15:2> Dear Sir or Madam: I am responding to your ad for the position of

Headteacher in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#16:2> I have a B.Ed. in Secondary education with a double major in English

and French, and an M.Ed. in Teaching English as a Second Language ( ESL).
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#17:2> I have taught adult ESL for nine years, have worked as Teacher

Training Coordinator in charge of training and in-service workshops for a

staff of 20 language instructors, and served as Academic Advisor for African

students wishing to study in the United States.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#18:2> I have extensive experience in curriculum and instructional materials

development, and have been responsible for ordering academic materials,

organizing reference and resource libraries, developing placement tests and

exams, and scheduling classes.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#19:2> Although most of my experience has been with adults, I taught at the

junior high and high school levels for three years as a Student Teacher in

the B.Ed. program at the <@> University of Western Canada </@> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#20:2> Besides my experience with teaching, curriculum development and

teacher training, I am a " people person" and relate well to people with a

variety of personalities.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#21:2> I work well in a facilitative role, recognizing and tapping <w>

peoples' </w> strengths and talents.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#22:2> I have good organizational skills but am not a dominating person.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#23:2> As a teacher I believe it is important to recognize different

learning styles among students, to establish a warm, trusting sense of

community in the classroom, to draw on community resources, and to help

students know how to relate what is studied to their own lives.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#24:2> I am confident that my professional experience and organizational

skills, my interest in people, and my ability to adapt to new environments

and draw on the knowledge and strengths of staff members would be an asset

should you consider me for the position of Headteacher. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#25:2> I am married, with 2 daughters ages 4 and 6.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#26:2> My husband, <@> Ted </@> , is currently completing his Master's

thesis on refugee issues and has been considering doing research in

Bangladesh for some time.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#27:2> In our search for overseas positions, <@> Ted </@> and I have run

into problems because we are a family and most organizations seem to be

looking for single adults.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#28:2> I am including my husband's resume so that you may be confident that

he will be able to find employment on his own in Bangladesh. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#29:2> I would love to provide my children with a cross-cultural

experience such as I had, early in their lives.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#30:2> My greatest interest, which was formed during the 16 years I spent in

Zaire, Africa, is getting to know different cultures, learning new languages,

and working with people in educational settings. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#31:2> Thank you for your consideration. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#32:2> Sincerely, <@> Felicity Lunse </@> </p> </I>


<I>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#33:3> Dear <@> Ryan </@> , Until last Thursday afternoon we believed

that all the necessary negotiations had been completed, that our role would

remain the same as before with the department taking care of the Application

for Funding, the <@> BLAH </@> Budget Breakdown, and the Forecast of Cash

Flow, and that we would simply sign the completed documentation.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#34:3> When you handed me the above mentioned forms with the instructions

that <@> Esther </@ and I would now be required to fill t hem out ourselves,

it signaled to us a shift in our role vis a vis the department. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#35:3> The transfer of these tasks from the department to us has

significant ramifications, particularly in light of the current trend within

the federal government to turn over more responsibility for settlement

services to the provinces and NGOs.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#36:3> If we are to assume a more independent role and take on the

responsibility of applying for funding, enumerating and breaking down our own

funding needs, it follows logically that the starting point of contract

negotiations must be the service provider's own proposal.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#37:3> It is inappropriate for the department to continue to dictate what we

are to write in our proposal, for that simply means we are doing the

department's paperwork and does not demonstrate any real shift towards

decentralization. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#38:3> <@> Esther </@> and I support the <@> New Wave </@> process and

would like to meet with you, <@> Juliana </@> and <@> Paul </@> to propose a

new way of " doing business" in which we take on more responsibility as a

self—contained service providing organization.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#39:3> Attached is a copy of the points we would like to discuss with the

three of you.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#40:3> It includes a re—evaluation of our schedule and remuneration

requirements based on these proposed changes and on the additional assessment

time involved in the implementation of <@> Checkpoints </@> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#41:3> One other issue which needs to be resolved is the implementation

of a straight forward and transparent system for payment of wages which

acknowledges our need to be paid in a timely manner.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#42:3> The current system of payment which has resulted in delays of up to

one month, in overpayments, and in an inability of the department to provide

us with accurate statements of our earnings for Income Tax purposes is not

acceptable.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#43:3> I know that you are looking into this matter and look forward to

receiving a comprehensible description of how payments will be handled in the

future. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#44:3> Thank you for your continued support. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#45:3> Sincerely, <@> Felicity Lunse </@> </p> </I>


<I>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#46:4> <h> <ul> Talking Points </ul> </h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#47:4> <h> ( For discussion with <@> Ryan Mosel </@> , <@> Juliana Nino </@>

<}> <-> & </-> <+> and </+> </}> <@> Paul Hachek </@> ) </h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#48:4> <h> 1. Proposed Changes in the Role of <@> Happy </@> Assessors </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#49:4> In support of <@> New Wave </@> objectives of transferring more

responsibility for settlement services to the provinces, non—government

organizations and private sector, <@> Esther </@> and I request the

department's support in shifting towards a more self—contained and

independent provision of language assessment, training referral, and

information services.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#50:4> Towards this end, we would like to continue to provide all current

services and add to our responsibilities the following: &bullet; Submission

of funding proposals and budget breakdown &bullet; Expanded provision of

complete <@> BLAH </@> / <@> Checkpoints </@> —related assessment services

and maintenance ( with the exception of U.I. <&> unemployment insurance </&>

referrals), to include: — indexing of client assessment information — booking

appointments ( with backup of voice message system) &bullet; Booking of

community liaison activities, such as: — information sessions with CECs, ESL

institutions, academic institutions and industries where applicable —

Out—of—office assessments with <@> ABCD </@> and <@> XYZ </@> groups, and <@>

Grb </@>
#1 evening programs &bullet; Booking of <@> Checkpoints </@> training for

other assessors based on department's recommendation &bullet; Determination

of appropriate professional development and training sessions </p>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#51:4> <h> 2. Proposed Re—evaluation of Schedule and Remuneration </h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#52:4> a) In order to reflect the addition of these new

responsibilities, as well as acknowledge the professional dedication that

will be required in implementing and building community confidence in the <@>

Checkpoints </@> assessment process, we request that our wage be rounded up

to &dollar;20 per hour from the current &dollar;18.70. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#53:4> b) Due to the fact that the <@> Checkpoints </@> assessment

process will take longer than the A— <@> BLAH </@> and will decrease the

number of clients we are able to see each day, as well as the fact that it

will require the writing of more detailed reports, we request a return to the

standard 5, 7 — hour days per week for in—office assessment to be divided

between the assessors.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#54:4> This is essential not only for balancing the number of clients we are

able to serve, but accomodates the additional time needed for computer

indexing and other tasks which will surely accompany the implementation of

<@> Checkpoints </@> . </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#55:4> Thank you for your consideration. </p> </I>


<I> <h>
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#56:5> Dear <@> Catherine </@> : <h>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#57:5> I will as briefly as possible outline what I have learned about

Mr. <@> Issah </@> 's language / literacy training history in <@> Gotham </@>

, as well as the suggestions I have made and organizations with whom I have

matched him in an on-going attempt to satisfy his self-expressed needs. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#58:5> I assessed <@> Osman </@> 's language proficiency for the first

time using the <@> BLAH </@> tool in October, 1995.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#59:5> At that time I noted that he has had virtually no formal schooling

and had basic first language literacy needs.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#60:5> Although English is his only language, his inability to read and

write beyond signing his name ( which, he told me, was all he could do), and

my inability to understand his dialect ( though I knew he was speaking "

fluently") placed him at a Pre- <@> BLAH </@> 1 level.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#61:5> Knowing that the Adult ESL Centre has an " Intake Stream" of

instruction for individuals with literacy needs, I referred him to 700 <@>

Monky </@> at that time. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#62:5> On the 28th of November, 1996 <@> Osman </@> returned to see me.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#63:5> He said it hadn't worked out at <@> Monky </@> and that he'd

subsequently been sent to <@> WorkTank </@> and the Salvation Army on <@> Elm

</@> , but that neither of these programs was right for him.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#64:5> I called <@> Josephine Pinot </@> at <@> Monky </@> who filled me in

on more details of his training and personal history.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#65:5> She felt that perhaps there were learning disabilities and emotional

issues which were interfering with his learning, and also told me that he had

been asked to leave the ESL class at <@> Monkwood </@> due to rudeness to

other students.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#66:5> Both <@> Josephine </@> and I felt that as a native speaker of

English, ESL institutions were not the best answer to his language / literacy

needs.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#67:5> I therefore contacted <@> Sheryl Pound </@> at the <@> Metro

Volunteer </@> Reading Aides to see what they could do for <@> Osman </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#68:5> She told me they would be happy to do an informal assessment to

determine both literacy level and whether there were learning disability

issues present.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#69:5> <@> Sheryl </@> put me in touch with <@> Victoria Kirkman </@> , a

<@> WSA </@> tutor of Carribean origin, who would not have any trouble

understanding <@> Osman </@> 's accent and who was willing to spend extra

time with him if necessary ( since he wanted more than the usual 2 hours per

week). </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#70:5> I spoke with <@> Victoria </@> today, February 5 and she was

surprised that <@> Osman </@> had been in touch with you and myself.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#71:5> ( He phoned me last week to tell me that things <quote> didn't work

out </quote> with <@> Victoria </@> .
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#72:5> <@> Victoria </@> felt that things were going very well, that she and

<@> Osman </@> had established a good rapport, and that he was enthusiastic

about learning and had made noticeable progress.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#73:5> The only explanation she could find for him telling me that <quote>

things didn't work out </quote> was that he had been having trouble making it

to scheduled sessions.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#74:5> She <}> <-> though </-> <+> thought </+> </}> perhaps scheduling and

possibly location ( they had been meeting at the public library) were

difficult for him. </p>

<p> <ICE-CAN:W1B-018#75:5> <@> Victoria </@> remains willing to work with <@> Osman </@> and

is willing to change location and continue to be flexible with the times of

tutoring sessions within reasonable limits.
<ICE-CAN:W1B-018#76:5> In fact, her next meeting with him is scheduled for Friday, February

7, at 12:00 noon. </p> </I>
