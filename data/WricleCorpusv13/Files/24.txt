recompensing Jewish people for the Nazi Holocaust which they had just suffered. The 
creation of Israel in the year  1948 was the culmination of the Zionist movement which 
had aimed at creating a commom homeland of jews, who were scattered around the 
world following the disapora. As it can be seen when reading through the Old 
Testament, a considerable number of Jewish most importan holly sites are located in 
what used to be the former British mandate of Palestina,  so in November 1947 de U.N., 
strongly supported by the United States, adopted the decision of putting into practice the 
partition plan which <Q> <R>. This 
decision has been argued to be unfair by the Palestinians who were displaced and by 
some neighbouring Arab countries such as Egypt, Jordania, Syria or Lebanon who have 
also been affected by the illegitimate Israeli colonization.  <Q> <R>. We are 
dealing with a conflict wich ahs two different approaches, it can be seen as an internal 
problem between Israelis an Palestinians but it can also be seen as a conflict between 
the Arab world and the Christian world. This may be one of the reasons why there is 
quite a lot of international interfering and so many different view points regarding the 
conflict and its solution. When analysing the main suggestions in what respects the 
solution of the conflict we do not find a clear separate israli and palestinian point of 
view. <Q> <R>. As this resulted in a violent armed 
conflict which also involved other countries the U.N. finally came to a peace resolution 
by the means of the Oslo Accords which <Q> <R>. In this essay I am going to discuss the 
different issues which still need to be dealt with as a result of the solution taken of 
creating two seperate states from the point of view of its major participants, and I am 
going to give my opinion on each of the different perspectives from which the conflict 
can be dealt with.
       In the one hand we find Israel authorities who fear for the security of their 
citizens as a result of the Palestinian suicide bombers. Since the conflict began, they 
seem to have choosen military actions and restrictions on palestinians rights to confront 
the problem of the armed uprisings. This is the reason why <Q> <R> in order to prevent Palestinian 
terrorism. <Q> <R>. In my point 
of view, it seems quite obvious that Palestinian Authorities -Palestine Liberation 
Organization (PLO)- have a serious problem concernig the issue of terrorism which 
they have not yet managed to face. Some Palestinian relgious groups, such as the ones 
mentioned above, are the ones to carry along the armed uprisings known as the Intifada 
which also has to do with the religous belief of the Islamic Jihad or Holly War. But it is 
not the armed uprisings of Palestinains to face the Israeli army what most concerns 
Israel, it is the terrorist attacks carried along by radical supporters of the PLO in Israel's 
public sites that worries them, because they are killing civilians who have nothing to do 
with the armed conflict. From 2000 to 2005 <Q> <R>.This is way it may be reasonable for some to argue that the military action of 
israel against Palestine is a retaliaton. In my point of view this argument has a strong 
weakness, especially when regarding to the facts which show that <Q> <R>. have been killed in the same oeriod of time by the Israeli Army. Well, I 
personally think that killing civilians who live opressed by your military power and 
control will not end the problem of terrorism, moreover, it can even feed the feeling of 
revenge of Palestinians. 
       In the other hand we have Palestine Liberation Organitations (PLO) which 
condem the armed Palestinan uprising but who also feel the need of a Palestinan State 
without Israeli occupation. Palestinians had to suffer the military occupation of Israel 
who was highly aid by the United States, both economically and military, and so it may 
be understandable the fact that some armed groups emerged to face this occupation. 
<Q> <R>. It is also a sad 
issue to mention the fact that there are many Palestinian Refugees who have to live in 
Refugee Camps which are located in the Palestinian occupied territories. <Q> <R>. I personally think that 
from this data we can come to the conclusion that there are people in Israel who leave in 
conditions which do not respect human rights and so something needs to be done. I tend 
to believe that many of the measures taken by Israel far from ending up with the 
problem of terrorism  are restrictions to Palestinan's access to schools, hospitals and 
agricultural land.
       As I have above mentioned, other neighbouring Arab countries, the United 
States and the United Nations are also secundary participants of the conflict.The Arab 
countries have taken part for Palestine, as they have also suffered Israel's military 
occupation, and feel they have to fight christianism out of the Arab World. The United 
States have always clearly taken part for Israel both Military and economically mainly 
because of their political intrests in the Middle East. Finally the United Nations 
ultimately are taken more decissions about the conflict and the past year 2005 declared 
illegitimate Israel's military occupation of Palestina and they obliged them to withdraw 
from that territories, but i personally tend to believe that they are not really putting 
much effort on making Israel adjust to the law.
       As a conclusion, from my point of view the United Nations are the ones who 
need to work the hardest on the solution of this problem, because I believe that if 
Palestinians keep on feel repressed by the military occupation of Israel the terrorist 
attacks will not stop. I think an International interaction is need to ensure Israeli and 
Palestinian security, to deal with the fate of the Palestinian refugees and to make sure 
Israel follows the law.
       
       


    
    In our modern societies, one of the most controversial issues is whether people 
under- age who commit serious crimes should be judged by a criminal court and be 
treated as adults or they should be judged by a special juvenile court and receive softer 
punishments with the hope of a change in their behaviour. The Resolution nï¿½ 45/III 
approved by the Assembly of the United Nations in 1990 recognises it <Q> <R>. In Spain the last reform of the minors criminal law 
is accused of being inappropriate by some lawyers because on their views <Q> <R>. In Germany the article number 3 of the penal code 
says:<Q> <R> are good examples of different positions towards the minors law "  This is a very 
complex issue in which it is essential to take into account the understanding of the 
youngsters of the crimes they commit, the conditions in which criminality develops and 
the efficiency of the punishments that adult criminals receive by themselves between 
other aspects that are worth considering. In this essay I am going to show the reasons 
why I consider that youngsters under-age who are old enough to be self-conscious of 
the crimes they commit, should receive the same punishments as if they were adults. 
For this purpose, I am going to comment some of the aspects that feed the polemic such 
as the question of which kind of judicial treatment reduces criminality in a better way, 
my suggestion to the difficult election of the age in which young people can start to be 
judged as adults for the crimes they commit and the consideration of a better 
reintegration in society and total abandonment of criminal activities in young people 
cases than in adult ones.
    
    One of the main reasons why there is such a polemic it is because there are different 
opinions concerning which is the best way of preventing young people form committing 
crimes again. There are many people who think that treating juveniles as adult criminals 
does not stop their criminality, but even it makes them <Q> <R>. However, these arguments 
can be weakened if we consider the results of a research made on bullying and their 
results, which shows clearly that bullies at school become criminals much more easily 
when they grow up. This study warns people of the danger of considering bullying as a 
<Q> <R>. 
We could infer of this study the fact than when young people start committing crimes; 
they are much more likely to continue committing them if they are not severely 
punished. We can also add the results of an interesting study done by the sociologist 
Claire Johnson who interviewed 19 young men who were serving sentences for 
homicide. She found that <Q> 
and that some of them considered that <Q>, because they 
were only to be there <Q> <R>. It could be argued 
that the younger a person is, the easier will be to reintegrate her/him into the society 
and, for this reason, it could be more appropriate to try to give youngster who commit 
crimes an education rather than to punish them an introduce them so early in the 
criminal world. But going to prison does not mean that the possibility of beginning a 
new life is not possible, so the question would not be whether punishments young 
people should be tried as adults, but whether punishments that are used with adults are 
appropriate or not.  
    
    A second aspect that it is worth considering is the age from which we can start to 
consider young people self-conscious of the crimes they commit. I would say that 
fourteen years old is a proper age to be considered. Not only because the person is 
mature enough to know when she/he is doing something evil, but also because 
adolescence is a crucial period of life because the behaviour and mode of living that a 
young person takes will determine in a great amount what kind of person she/he is 
going to be in the future. It could be argued that there are plenty of cases in which a 
person who has had a problematic adolescence, has become more "mature", a totally 
different person in her adulthood. Although this is true, this change does not always 
take place and, when it does, it normally arises too late to repair all the damages made 
by the improper behaviour of this person in her youth. Moreover, these people normally 
assure that they would like to live this period again to try to make good the mistakes 
they have done. For this reason, I defend the idea that judging adolescents as adults, will 
make them become more aware of the kind of life that could be waiting for them if they 
continue doing criminal activities.
    
    Some people do find a contradiction in the fact that young people who have no yet 
the totality of civil rights, receive the same punishment as adults. They question the 
coherency of the laws and say that if people under age are not considered mature 
enough to make adult decisions, they should not be considered at the same level as 
fully-grown people. From my point of view, we cannot put at the same level all the 
conditions of maturity. Principles such as the respect for other people's life and physical 
and emotional integrity can be easily learnt in childhood. The respect for other people's 
possessions or about the harm that drug dealing causes in society do not need being 
more than 18 years old to be understood. This argument can be responded by saying 
that some young people do not have opportunities to learn such principles, because their 
family environment was not appropriate to develop such a basic ethical thinking. 
However, I would argue that despite the fact that this is true, we cannot simply accept 
this as a valid excuse for justifying what they do in a certain way and, in consequence, 
make their punishment softer. Except in the case of people condemned to death penalty 
sentences, everyone who has committed a crime has the opportunity of repentance and 
of starting a new life.
    
    Education is one of the main arguments that people against people under-age being 
judged like adults use to support their position. The purpose of juvenile court processes 
is "to help young offenders rather than establish their guilt". For this reason, juvenile 
courts are "not considered trial courts" and they have "fewer restrictions and 
procedures" and, in consequence, juvenile court judges are free to impose the sanctions 
they think are appropriate. This fact is used by some judges to impose <Q> on young people <R>. 
For this reason, I do not consider this system a fair one, since it causes that the kind of 
sanction that teenagers receive depends more on their luck of finding one judge or 
another than on the harm of the crime by itself. Senator Joseph Biden, chairman of the 
Senate Judiciary committee, a critic of tougher youth crime laws told the senate that 
<Q>. I entirely agree with the idea that education plays an 
important role in the case of young people committing crimes, even in the case of older 
people; but I do not think that this assumption means that youngsters do not have to be 
judged and sentenced like adults in case they were aware of the crimes they committed. 
I believe that adult punishments are not necessarily contradictory with the idea of 
education and reintegration in society, but that they are complementary. I would suggest 
that educational measures should be taken to make better the conditions of people 
incarcerated, since it is something possible and realistic.
    
    The last point that I'm going to cover has to do with one of the main arguments of 
defenders of children rights. A research in US has found that "young people 
incarcerated with adults are five times as likely to be sexually assaulted by other 
inmates, are twice as likely to be beaten by staff, are 50% more likely to be assaulted 
with a weapon and are eight times as likely to commit suicides". It is undeniable that 
this is a strong argument that no person concerned with human rights can ignore, but I 
would discuss that this problem has to do entirely with the jail conditions by themselves 
and it is something that also affects adult people. So my suggestion is that strong 
measures should be taken to make better the conditions of people incarcerated, since it 
is something possible and realistic.
    
    To sum up, I have covered the main arguments of people against youngsters under 
age being judged as adults, which are their doubts about the efficiency of incarcerating 
people as the best mode of preventing them from committing crimes again, their hope of 
a change in their behaviour in a easier way than in adult criminality., the contradiction 
they find in the fact that people who have not still the totality of civil rights are punished 
like adults, their bet for educational measures rather than punishing ones and their 
denounce against the abuses that young people suffer in prisons. I have also expressed 
my reasons why I do not consider those are arguments so determining: the danger of 
being too permissive with young criminals, their self-awareness and cruelty in many 
crimes, the possibility of learning ethics from very early ages, the non-necessary 
contradiction between punishment and opportunity of changing and the fact that that 
violation of human rights that young people suffer are a different problem that has to be 
studied by itself and is not necessarily intrinsic in the idea of punishment. I have also 
suggested an age, 14 years old, in which a person can be considered fully responsible of 
her acts. As a conclusion I would say that it seems that both educational measures and 
punishment have to be taken into account in order to fight against minor criminality; the 
real debate is which one has to be more accentuated in each case.
