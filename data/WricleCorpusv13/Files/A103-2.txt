
Since the beginning of 2006,there is a new law in Spain.This law restrict smoking in public places,like in restaurants,pubs,offices,etc...and the distribution of tobacco.Before the law you could buy tobacco in many places such as petrol stations,shops,etc...now,with the new law you only can buy tobacco in special shops called "estancos" and in some bars and restaurants.This law has created an important discussion in Spain.In this essay I'm going to show the differents points of view about this new law.

One of the argument that non smokers give is that the new law is going to improve the health of all the Spanish citizens.This law not only is going to improve health of passive smokers.It's going to improve the health of all people,smokers and non smokers.The new law restrict the publicity of tobacco and this is good for the new generations and to reduce the number of smokers.

On the other hand,the groups of smokers and some associations criticed the new law.They say that the law goes against the freedom of the smokers.They say that It's a persecution against smokers but they don't understandwhy because tobacco is sold by the government really.This association say that the law is very hard with the smoker.If a worker wants to smoke he has to go out and this is very ridiculus.

There are different opinions.Some people think that this law has positive aspects and other bad aspects.These people say that It's a good law,for example not smoke in public places,at work,universities,etc...but they think is too restrictive and without adaptation period.For example,not smoke in pubs is very hard,because tobacco is like alcohol and this is not ban.

Although the law appears to be persuasive,It has certain weakness.The government couldn't ban totally tobacco because It gives lots of money to the state.There are other weakness points.Fos example,smoker have the same right than the non smoker if ,at work ,one goes to drink a coffe and the smoker goes to smoke a cigarette.

In conclusion,people must respect the antitobacco law.Smokers has to respect non smokers and non smokers has to be more tolerant,because is very difficult stop smoking.The new law tries to improve the health of citizens and the smokers have to understand that they can smoke,not everywhere but in some places where they don't disturb other people.
