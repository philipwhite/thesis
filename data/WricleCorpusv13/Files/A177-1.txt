      In the past few years society has experimented important changes and as a consequence of them, their priorities and worryings have also vary. There exist different types os societies in the world, but, symplifying, there are two main types: rich and poor. This essay is focused on the issues that, in my opinion, worry rich countries nowdays which in many cases they are a result of the situation  poor countries are linving. Eventhought we can difference between  the developed, which are the ones located on the north-hemisphere, and the poor ones: Africa, Asia and South America, in general terms the worryngs are very similar or at least they have some kind of connection.


      To begin with, one of the most important issues that worry our society these days is terrorism. Terrorism is something that can sound " sound " modern but it is, in fact, something that has remained all trough history. It has been there, in one way or in other. But it is true that since terrorists attacks to de World Trade Center in New York on the 11th September, it seems as if terrorism has taken more relevance. Moreover, I strongly feel that since this days the world has changed. Here in Spain, as in many other parts of the world they exist different terrorist groups such as ETA in Spain, IRA  in North Ireland or Sendero Luminoso in Peru. Other countries had never before experimented what terrorism means, what terrorist do, how they act and the consequences of theirs actions.


     Another main issue that concerns modern societies is poverty. Poverty mainly exists in those undeveloped countries situated on the south hemisphere: South America, Africa, where we find the most poor country in the world: Niger, and many ohter countries in the Middle East. In spite of the ones that suffer poverty directly, there are other countries suc as USA, Europe or Japan tha feel the consequences. The most significant one is inmigration, which is the third issue with some kind of relevance in our society. If the developed countries do not help the undeveloped ones to escape from misery, the poor will continue in the same state and we will see how their population keeps on growing and tohse children in a futute would like to have better lifes. This has advanteges and disadvantages.


     On the one hand inmigration is good for the first world because it brings cheap labour, they increase the number of young population, they contribute to the development of the nation, etc...On the other hand, the integration of the inmigrants can have bad effects because of the culture, the xenofobic that exist in our society,etc...and all this brings violence, more insecurity.


      To end up, it is clear from my point of view that these threesocial issues are not the only ones that concerned us these daysis, but they are fore sure ones of the most important. As I said at the beginning society has changed though history, but in a more significant way in te XX century. We have experimented huge changes in our way of life and as everything it has its repercusions. At the moment, these are our worryings, in a future they may change, but what is clear is that there will always be issues that will concerned people.
