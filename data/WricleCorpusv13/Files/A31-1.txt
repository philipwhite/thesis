          People rigth to marriage and no discrimination are in international human rigths. In countries like  China, Austria, Arabia Saudi, Uganda, Iran or UU.EE homosexual people are discriminated. In other  countries like Holand, U.K, Canada, Spain, Norman, Belgica(here homosexual people can not adopt),  Germany or Australia homosexual people can get married and, in some cases, they can adopt children. In  Spain there are 56,9% people  in favour of same sex marriage and 42,4% are in favour of homosexual  adopt children. This two issues are very polemic for siciety.         I agree with same sex marriage. I think that if two persons love each other and they want to get  married why they can not if they are two men or two women and they can if they are a man and a woman,  all of them are persons and they must have the same rights. Besides if they life together and life their lives  in the same way that a man and a woman marriage life then they should have the same privileges as they  have the same obligations.         I also agree with the issue that homosexual people adopt children. If they treat the children good  and give the children a good education and love there is no problem.Besides there are many families  where parents divorce or even the father or the mother is an alcoholic person or they do not take care of  their children or that the father mistreat the mother, there are children who bring up with one parent  or  without parents and so on, so this  children  will be afected in the future, then why homosexual people can  not adopt children if they can give children a happy home.         Of course there are many diferent opinions about this issues, for example there are people that  do not agree with homosexual marriage because they say that it is not a natural thing, but if it is not a  natural thing why does it exist? Then is a nature failure and they are not guilty of that. Even there are  people who still think that homosexual people have an illness and they can cure with a treatment or that  they are mad. Also some religions compare homosexual facts with a crime.  This is a discrimination way.         Also there are pople that think that homosexual people should not adopt children because  children would be gays too, because children imitate parents behaviour. I ask then why exist homosexual  people if their parents are not, they have no imitate their parents behaviour. Besidea there are research  that prove that children brougth up with homosexual couple are not diferent of children brought up with a  man and a woman family. I think that if one man likes men this is not because his father likes men, is only  because he likes men.         In conclusion, We are not use to this situation and this is why some people is getting alarm, but if  people were adapted to this situation i am sure that there would not be problems with adopting children  and neither with homosexual marriage. Homosexual people have not choosen it and they can not change  it.
