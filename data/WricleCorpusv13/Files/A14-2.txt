
The legalisation of Marijuana, a problem that farm from being solved every day generates spacing between the oposite parts.

When for some people the canabis is not more that a simple drug and as so does not have never to be carried out its legalization, for the others [] they contradict this but that think that this ilegalization is the base of the presence of mafias and increases that is this [], all this and more, we cannot forget the people who consider it as a medicinal plant by their terapeutics effects although in their contradicton are the experts doctors that they have examined the consequences and damages that the marijuana produces in an organism.

Some people would claim that the marijuana wouldn't be legalised because it's a drug as the others, they considered the begining of the end if the marijuana would be legal and a drug could be within of all the people, they consider not moral that this drugs can be bought for all the people and that his consumption were free, because his repercussion for the health are very dangerous and the people doesn't know and the problem for the young people and their consum f the marijuana were legal would be [].

On the other hand, the people believe that the marijuana would be legalised and there are a lot of arguments for support his. They think that the marijuana as a illegal drug only produce narcotics mafias and the explotation of the immigrants and the poor people by part of this bands because the marijuana can be adulterated with insecticide or chemical substances producing a harmful efects, more harmful that the efects that they have in his natural state and all this like this very reasonable arguments.

Other parts in this theme about the legalisation of the marijuana are the experts in media. They think and talk about the negative consecuences that this drug have in the human organism, because for all of them, the idea of that the marijuana isn't a drug [] is a soft drug is questionable due to its effects and they alert on the increase of concentration of the active substance that causes the dependency and they cannot considered as soft drug a drug that have as consecuences [] lost of the capacity of the memory and the concentration.

However, some people thinks that would be used as a medical intruments but really the date that support the use canabis are purely anecdotics. Althoug the specialist insist on the necessary of controlled studies, but they think this, also they believe that the canabis does not have being dangerous that somniferos with  [] for example, since the cannabis on the contrary don't it created dependency not being necessary to increase the dose, but that neverthless even being in favour of its single legalisation would to be allowed for personal consume avoiding the sale except for authorized like doctors that these would to verify the purity and concentration of THC.

They are arguments in favour and against about the legalisation of the marijuana, opinion and arguments of all type and for all the people. Basing on mainly in the health and the damages that produce, for example, the adulteration of this and its sale on the past of the drugs trafficking organizations but who a reason by which must be to consider its legalisation, in adittion to legalise it single for a use autonome and controlled so that their distribution is safe in their effect and it action, only for arguments that based more on the consumition [] that must to welcome well in a drug like this in a society where the main consumers, the sensible adolescents are the [] to the consumption of these modern drugs.
