   Ever since the first human communities were founded, several rules were created   in order to regulate people's coexistence and to prevent certain conducts that were   considered as anti-social. Thus, the law was born. But, with the law or even before it,   crime was also born. The struggle between law and crime has always been present in   our societies and, as the law became stronger, crime became more sophisticated, up to   the point when criminals began to organize themselves. By this, what is known as   organized crime was born. In this essay, I will analyze the role that organized crime   plays in society. I will give my personal opinion about this issue and give different   points of view on whether it is possible or not to erase it from our societies.      First of all, I would like to begin by explaining what is organized crime. Organized   crime, or what is more popularly known as "mafia", is crime carried out systematically   by formal criminal organizations. The FBI defines organized crime as any group having   some manner of a formalized structure and whose primary objective is to obtain money   through illegal activities. Such groups maintain their position through the use of actual   or threatened violence, corrupt public officials, graft or extortion, and generally have a   significant impact on the people in their locales, region, or the country as a whole.         One of the basic characteristics of organized crime is that it submerges itself in the   society, spreading its tentacles both through the low and the high levels of society. The   main reason for this "immersion" is that, if the organization wants to survive and   prosper, it needs some kind of support from the society in which it develops its   activities. For instance, if an organization wants to gain the support of, let's say, the   bakery trade of a certain neighbourhood or city, it would, for a small consideration,   offer them their protection against common criminals such as muggers or burglars. But   it would also use other methods such as blackmail, bribery and any form of corruption   in order to gain the favour of higher or more relevant social members, like policemen,   lawyers, judges and politicians.     This is one of the reasons for which, in my opinion, organized crime plays a quite   significant role in the society, and I would like to explain this with an example. The   mafia clans usually work as bankers for the community in which they operate; but,   contrary to banks, when someone is unable to pay them back, they don't take possession   of the debtor's properties. If the debtor is a shopkeeper, the mafia doesn't seize his   shop. They allow him to go on with his business, only that the mafia becomes the   owner, and the debtor becomes an employee of the organization and receives a salary.      Another important characteristic of organized crime is that it's not visible, that it's   disguised with a layer of legality. Thus, many criminal organizations have substantial   legitimate businesses, such as licensed gambling, building construction, or dock loading   enterprises, which operate in parallel with and provide cover for drug trafficking, money   laundering or prostitution among many other possible criminal activities. I would like to   argue that, from my point of view, this is a very important characteristic because it   allows the criminal organization to develop its activities under the complete   unawareness of the rest of the society. According to Lucchini, <Q> .      This is only an example of a phenomenon of which, it seems to me, we are not very   aware. In my opinion, when we discuss issues such as corruption in the urban   development, we only see the surface of the problem and we tend to blame politicians   for being corrupt. I think that, if we looked deeper into the problem, we would realize   that the real cause is the presence of organized crime.      So far, we have seen the definition of organized crime and we have seen some of its   basic and most important characteristics. Now I would like to analyze some possible   solutions against this type of crime. In my opinion, one of the keys in fighting organized   crime is seeing crime from the perspective of a structured and well organized activity,    not just focusing on crimes as single events committed by independent individuals. This   is the basic principle in the strategy followed by the FBI's Organized Crime Program.   The FBI has found that even if key individuals in an organization are removed, the   depth and financial strength of the organization often allows the enterprise to continue;   therefore, the FBI targets the entire organization responsible for a variety of criminal   activities.        One attitude that seems to be quite efficient against organized crime is to drain its   income from illegal activities. This is the key fight which the Czech Republic has   employed in its security policy since 1999, with the creation of specialized groups to   work on this. Confiscating illegally obtained financial means has proved an effective   method of tackling organized criminal groups, forfeiting the results of their actions and   also the financial means to continue their criminal activities. To me, it makes sense that   this measure turned out to be effective because, in my opinion, what these criminals   really care about is having their possessions confiscated and not so much about being   deprived of their freedom, that is being put into jail, because they seem to be able to go   on controlling the organization from inside the prison.      Finally, I would like to say that, in my opinion, these solutions seem quite appropriate   in the fight against organized crime, but we should not only apply police measures. I   believe that there is also a social component in the origin of organized crime. The   depressed areas or neighbourhoods of cities such as Naples, Moscow or New York, to   put some examples, seem to be a pool of new members for the criminal organizations,   due to the poverty in which its inhabitants live. In my opinion, we should put more   efforts on social policies, such as fighting unemployment in these depressed areas, so   that these people would not see the enrolment in a criminal organization as a way of   escaping poverty.      To sum up, we have seen a couple of definitions of organized crime. We have seen   that organized crime submerges itself in the society, corrupting and controlling different   members of it, and that it develops a number of illegal activities under the disguise of   other legal ones. We have seen some measures that are being used to fight organized   crime, the strategy of the FBI of attacking the organization as a whole, and the measure   of confiscating the organization's incomes and possessions that is used by the Czech   Republic. Finally, we have seen that this type of crime has also a social component and   that there should also be social measures applied in fighting it.
