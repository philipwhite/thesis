             Little time ago, a law accepting marriages between people from the same sex has been  approved in Spain. This is the first country in the E.U. in which homosexual couples can get  marriaged with the same rights than the heterosexual couples, including child adoption. This  law has caused polemics because Spain is a traditionally catholic country where word  "marriage" is associated just with the union of a man and a woman in the presence of catholic  church. Previously it had already been accepted the union of a gay couple and they were given  some rights, but they were still apart from our society. There exist groups and forces in this  country specially linked to catholic church that reject this law and call it as uncostitutional.       I think that gay marriage's law, even being for a minority, is a great social advance  because it increases people's freedom, supports existent situations and modernizes our country,  what ,as I think, is an advantage for everyone.       Gay people have existed all along the history. There has been civilitations where they  have been accepted and asumed as in old Greek or Rome. Christian advance forbade every  relation chances between people of the same sex, considering it one of the main sins of this  religion.       For natural laws, reproduction is essential, however, the existence of gay people is a real  fact, not only between human beings but also between animals. And this doesn't put the specie  in danger of extinction. By looking at that, I think that society must assume the existence of this  phenomenon and accept that they are not people whith a disease or some kind of depraved; they  are just people who have chosen a different option from the majority.       Constitution tells that "every Spain inhabitant has the same rights without discrimination  for his/her sex, origyn or condition", so what gay marriage law is allowing, carries this article  out.  Even, that article doesn't specify if it must be between men and women, but that they  should do it freely. Which prooves again the validity of the law.       Catholic associations and the Vatican are protesting energically because they only  consider marriage on its traditional form. Well then, their gays shouldn't get married. But I  think that they should allow the others to do what they whish.         To apply this law to this minority doesn't strip anybody from his rights. Why do they  prevent them from improoving their lives conditions?       Those who are opposed says to be defending the family, and they are mostly against gay  people to adopt. Honestly, I think that adoption should be well-ordered very carefully to assure  that the children will grow up in a happy abience, and to get that, I don't find it indispensable  both a father and a mother. It's a fact that an unmarried woman can adopt a child without  problems, and nobody cares if she shares her house or her life with another woman. But if they  were married... that would scandalize the traditionalists.       The law approved by the spanish governement is giving example to another countries,  what will help to increase the rights and liberties of every citizen.       What nowadays scandalize some people will be surely something normal on next  generations. As well as it happened with divorce law and many others.        I think that in the end everybody will accept the fact that this law doesn't damage neither  the traditional family, nor the children, nor anybody. Maybe in the future, children adopted by  gays families culd be socially accepted and the law could be carryed out natrally. In fact,  following the surveys, a 66% of spanish people already accept it.
