During the past few years,the Spanish society has changed to much in several aspects in the last years. Certain social preoccupations,like the implantation of euro,the increase of the prices or massive immigration,among other subjects, have done that in Spain this vortex of events overflows it. In general,these changes have happened in so fast and an abrupt way,that the assimilation capacity is still very slow. Although this is logical:to digest a sum of phenomena that tolerates a series of important changes would have to be made in small doses;but everything has been sudden and the digestion is clogged,
bearing the changes day to day. Next,I am going to speak about three social subjects that they affect and they worry to the present Spanish society:the increase of the standard of life,the immigration and the increase of poverty in Spain.

          Firstly,the economic level of the Spanish families has gotten worse.One of the 
most important reasons is the implantation of euro,the European currency,as of year 2002.Apparently,the Spaniards not yet assimilate that the value of 1 euro is equivalent to 170 pesetas,the previous currency;still it remains the idea that 1 euro are 100 pesetas,but its value in fact is near the double. This causes an underflow in the daily expenses that affects the personal and familiar economy with negative consequences in the long term..This "monetary phase angle" has increased the bank loans,as much to face great debts,like the mortgaged payment of a house,or the concession of whims,like an aesthetic operation,a villa in a district of luxury or a pleasing trip. So,we became indebted ourselves with the financial organizations for necessary and unnecesary expenses.I do not speak only of a small percentage of addict people to the consumption,but of the whole society,which is lent to assume debts for life. The banks,evidently,the hands rub,because with such effusion of cost and unstoppable consumption,they offer fast money to us and without too many questions or mortgages to pay along 50 years-with all the interests that these drag-. In a interview with Gloria Hernandez,principal authority  for the State Society of Transition to the Euro,she comments the unquestionable benefits to us to share the unique currency: to belong to an economic area totally integrated and more stable, lower types of interest, we do not have inflation, when we go away for a trip to the countries of the zone euro (12 of the 15 of the UE) we will not have to bother itself in exchanging; to be able to cross borders and to understand the prices of a look, to see exactly if your country is cheaper than the product of the neighbour country, which is going to cause more competition between the countries,it is going to be much more simple to travel,there are no costs to pay the changes either, life is easier and mainly for the students who travel much and euro turns Europe to be another power of world-wide level like the U.S.A. or Japan.Perhaps these facts had happened in intact way,but reality is very different:to equal the Spanish economic level with the European that has an upper economic level has repelled in our pockets:we spent more,and knowing this,we continue it doing.Now, Spain is completely a consumer society,and using euro the moderation disappears. 

          Secondly,immigration,another great phenomenon that not only also affects to Spain but Europe in general.The massive arrival of immigrants in better or worse condition-you compare between to arrive by airplane or by car or to come in patera or jumping fences that hurts physically- it has done that the rich countries,those who are supporting this massive arrival and the excess of illegal population,take measures to restrain this "invasion". My question is:why do these people come to Europe if they know that they  will run risks or the laws have become hardened to obtain a work and a legal permanence? what has Europe that pushes these people to do it? In my opinion,the rich countries try to restrain something that they themselves cause:they do not help the poor countries to leave its constant crises,but rather they take advantage of they-like the establishment of known industries in poor zones so that the production costs are low and therefore to pay miserable pays,the maintenance of the external debt of these which very in the long term creates an economic dependency or by life,so,these "third-world ones" aspire for something much more better that remain in a permanent state of social,economic and political whips in their countries.

          Thirdly,agreed with the points exposed before,the number  of people without home has increased in Spain;it carries great problems,not only for the high number of unemployed people or the familiar uprooting,but also the increase of the  consumption,the problems of legalization for who arrive from outside or the social rejection towards those people who the margin of the order already established has left them out: the social aids are not sufficient to cover the necessities of the population,reason why first that suffers are these people with a low level of income.

          In conclusion,synthesizing the three previous points,I think that the quality of life for people is worse now in comparison with previous years,and although in Spain measures exist that restrain the excess of expenses and accumulation of debts like the social security or the pensions,that is to say,Spain is a country with social approach still and everything is not privatized,the future it does not seem very obliging with us,so we will undergo the damage to live for survival and it would be possible to see ourselves crossing the border between living or surviving.But possibly, in a better case, we will  only become indebted for all our life without thinking too much about which we have left to settle.
