As a result of this, piracy appears to be so expanded that it deals with so different branches such as music, literature, cinema or fashion. Nevertheless, I will mainly focus on copying and downloading music since many people would agree that this kind of piracy is probably one of the most important and developed ones. According to IFPI  <R>  <Q>  <R> . In this essay I will try to give my opinion concerning the issue of unauthorized copying. 

      To begin with, I tend to feel that refering <R> <Q>  On the contrary, some people consider that since the RAE dictionary defines it as <R> , the term "piracy" can be clearly used in this sense. Despite of this, I would maintain that as I don't believe that illegal copying is just like kidnapping and murder, my own opinion of this is that it would be better to use <R> <Q> .
      
      Secondly, I strongly believe that prohibited copies are a cheaper alternative to extremely dear original ones. I woud argue that not everybody can afford to pay so expensive products, specially as Manu Chao says, <Q> <R> . Thus, I think it reasonable that people get things at a lower price or even free. However, Loquillo explains that <Q> <R>  My own opinion of this is that what companies really want is to get more money in less time, since I tend to feel that whereas the price of original copies is more and more high, the number of themes it has is smaller.   
      
      On the other hand, those against unauthorized copying claim that pirated merchandise is inferior with respect to quality and quantity. To show this, it has been said that in the case of cd's <Q> <R> . Moreover, some people argue that original copies include the lyrics of the songs or a dvd with images from the concerts. Firstly, it appears to me that it is the music itself that really matters and not those secondary things. Secondly, I personally believe that quality is not always worse: For my part, I consider that songs or movies downloaded from the internet have a clearly acceptable sound and image quality.
      
      Next, I feel that prohibited copying has two positive consecuences: Firstly, I strongly believe that poor people can make a living and secondly, I would argue that it is a way of fighting against capitalism. Personally speaking, there are lots of people (specially inmigrants) who have great difficulties to find a job in a labor world controlled by power and money. As a result of this, I think that unauthorized copying becomes the only way for them to achieve economic resources and at the same time, to compete against big companies. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that on buying a cd in the "Top Manta" <Q> <R>  In my view, this argument has no validity at all because it seems to me that, on buying a cd <Q> <R> . In addition to this, I would maintain that <Q> . 

      On the contrary, it is generally claimed that the increase of prohibited copying has a bad consecuence: the closing-down of enterprises, and the consequent decrease of employment. It would appear that recording companies <Q> <R> . Therefore, <Q> <R> . As a result of this, <Q> <R>  Speaking personally, if unauthorized copying did not exist the amount of original copies sold would be the same as at the present time, since I believe that people would be reluctant to spend so large a sum of money on them. On top of that, I feel that recording companies use prohibited copying as an excuse, since I think that in the majority of cases economic interests related with property are the real reason for the closing.
                
      Another point is that in my opinion <Q> <R> . It appears to me that letting people have free access to music is a very good way of promoting and developing it. What is more, my opinion of this is that this kind of unauthorized copying also promotes <Q> <R> . Despite this, some people agree that it is a crime which goes against law and it <Q> <R> . As far as I think, <Q> <R> . Furthermore, I believe that <Q> <R> . Finally, I tend to feel that the great advantage of downloading music from the internet is that it allows you to have more music and as M-Clan says, <Q> <R>  	
      
      Nevertheless, it is sometimes said that prohibited copying damages artists' reputation and rights very seriously. It is likely that musicians, singers, songwriters and producers' creativity and ability is not valued as it should. An additional point is that their intellectual property seems to be quite affected as copyright <Q> <R>  is violated: <Q> <R> . For my part, I consider that these are pretexts which hide, once again, their true worry: to loose money due to unauthorized copying.
      
      To sum up, I have dealt with different items regarding the topic of prohibited copying. Firstly, I have shown how terminology can be manipulated. Secondly, I have talked about commercial issues such as price, quality and quantity. Then, I have presented the consecuences of unauthorized copying. Next, I have seen its advantages in terms of expansion and development. Finally, I have dealt with prohibited copying with reference to artist's rights. Having regarded all this, it seems to me that unless recording companies together with government hit up on an effective solution, unauthorized copying will continue creating controversy for a long time.
