In some cases like Spain, abortion is still a social taboo and controversial issue that is intensify in a politic framework, especially with electoral campaigns when political parties present different viewpoints and new advances, even it was legalized after almost 23 years. The legal position of abortion in Spain only agrees with abortion in therapeutics, eugenics or ethical indications; another viewpoint is the radical "pro-choice" that considers that abortion must be legal at any time of the pregnancy; there is a liberal perspective which suggest that a period system is better; other argument correspond to a mid-point which also takes into account social circumstances or necessities and finally there is an extreme conservative position "pro-life", in contrast with "pro-choice", depending basically on religious beliefs that considers that abortion must be forbidden. In this essay I will try to analyse the different attitudes concerning abortion. 

               To begin with, the legal policy of abortion based mainly in therapeutics, eugenics o ethical perspective, reflect that this isn't a offence aborting when the development of the embryo supposes a hazard to the life, physical or psychic health for the mother in this case there is not a temporal limitation but is necessary a doctor report. Another case is when the woman has been raped, she can abort twelve weeks after it. And the last when the foetus has physical or psychic damages, in this case requires the reports of two doctors and can be realised before the 22nd week of pregnancy. Many people think that although these viewpoints appear to be persuasive, it has certain weaknesses because according to Widney Brown leader of Amnistía Internacional should include incest and more time in rape situations because the victim sometimes hasn't got enough time to recover from the terrible experience, isn't able to tell it and decide what to do. Also, in many occasions the period given to find any problem in the foetus is not sufficient. 

               There are several arguments in favour of abortion at any time of the pregnancy. Recent studies like the one of the doctor Ricardo Illia of the Hospital Materno Infantil Ramón Sarda, have proved that a 1% of the births are of died foetus of which a 70% have died during the pregnancy mainly from the middle to the last period approximately between 21 and 28 weeks of gestation and also other serious diseases are discovered late so many people think that they should have the right of decide if they want to have the children or abort whenever this happen. Other arguments that could be considered "pro-abortion" of voluntary interruption of pregnancy are that parents have created the child and they have the freedom to make the decision in order that the children is not considered a person until is born and has identity or the fact that 20 millions of insecure aborts take place every year all over the world according to the International Women's Health Coalition so this seems a logical argument for many people due to it is preferable to have legal aborting clinics than clandestine ones where people can die like in Tucumán, Argentina where, in the year 2004, there was a rate of 46% of deaths; and also because some people will continue doing abortions anyway.

               Some countries such as France, Denmark, Great Britain, Austria, Norway, Sweden or Finland as they know abortions happen in anyway controlled or not, have decided to introduce a new abortion system based in a period of three months based in biological, sanitary, political and social reasons. With this method the woman has a reasonable time to notice and accept her state and make an aware and voluntary decision: This point is rather convincing, however it seems reasonable to argue that could be used as contraceptive or emergency method in many occasions instead of using others birth control plans, specially between teenagers, like condoms; IUD or the pill and making abortion equal and not the exceptional measure that must be.

               However, it could be said that abortion is not totally good or bad in itself: what makes it acceptable is a balanced system which allows people aborting in some specific situations taking account personal circumstances or necessities as when the mother is suffering from a disease, due to an economical necessity, age or social problem such as when a couple hasn't got a career or a stable job, house and financial situation to avoid using abortion as a contraceptive method which has increased during the last years according to a research of Margarita Delgado Estudio sobre Hábitos de Vida y Salud entre Adolescentes (HBSC) which shows that a 15 % of the pregnancy and abortions have been a result of non secure sexual relations and the free and radical consideration of abortion. Also this intermediate point suggest that if a woman gets pregnant in a strained partner relationship and parents were denied abortion against their wishes dehumanizes women, the child could be not loved and well treated at all and suffer the consequences all its life which is an unfair argument for many people "pro-life" such as some religious believers.



               One of the strongest arguments maintains by some Christian religious people is that parents must accept the pregnancy and the consequences of a sexual relation not regarding difficulties, strained partner relationship or even the foetus has problems in its development and diseases because God is the only one who can decide people's fate and has created this new human being consequently for people's benefit. Moreover, most of these religious believers call person the impregnated ovule since the moment of the conception when a soul is given to it by God, instead till the moment of its birth, so abortion is according to Christian principles murder and a sin. However, in other cultures and religious beliefs abortion depends on the moment when a foetus become a person like in Judaism where until the birth, the foetus is not considered a human being so the woman can abort if her life is in danger.

               To conclude, we can see that there are many arguments concerning abortion. Some of them approve the legal aspects of current abortion system; other propose a new one which deals with the freedom of the individual choose whenever mother wants; others reflect on the possibility of a period system of abortion; another group suggest the possibility of abortion only in special circumstances and finally there are condemning arguments frequently coming from religious beliefs. The arguments in favour seam more reasonable in terms of pluralism because everyone is not religious and it seems unfair that an agnostic person could not abort due to a law based in religion. It could also be argued that government might take part in the issue offering alternatives to abortion such as giving the children in adoption or promoting a good sex education since when we are children.
