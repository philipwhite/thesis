Nowadays abortion is one of the most debated issues.The progress of medicine gives the possibility of give up the prenancy.There`re sofisticated techniques wich make that the "creature" die.However this chance is not always desired by the parents,who dont know what to do; they have to decide between having the child or not, it`s a difficult situation for the them, they dont want to have a children becouse it will be a no desire child but if they havent it they think that how thay have could "kill" a that creature..their creature.In other hand abortion is an illegal technique in most countries and therefore condemned and prosecuted,this essay will discuss different viewpoints about taking abortion.

Firstly, there`re quite arguments in favour of abortion.According to Dr.Carlos Morín "Women must have the opportunity to decide about have or not have the children without  explication. In Spain abortion is legal until 12 weeks of gestation, later of these weeks the technique only will be practique: First, if the mother is in risk having the baby,second if the woman have been violated and third if the baby will born with physicals and psicologycal problems. Some people think that medicine must be in service of humanity but within the limits that the parenst decide; is the parents said that they dont want to have the baby the doctor has to accept the decision. Recently the government is posing to change the law of abortion in order to increase the time to make the abortion technique.

Some arguments against abortion are maintained, mostly by religious people. Hardly all religious people reject abortion so the church is oppossed to abortion;an explication for that is said by the bible wich said " Woman tempt the men and she must suffer becouse God order it", The church also say that killing a creature, despite the reason or the method of doing it, is inmoral. Another possible viewpoint against abortion is the painful that the mother suffer when the doctors are doing her the technique, the mother will choose not having a baby becouse the parents cant afford the child or becouse this child is an error and never will be wanted, but when they do that they are killing a creature that could live and be happier in the future.The parents that have the baby in spite their possibilities hardly ever are regretful of have had the child but at the beginning is a difficult situation.

There`re also arguments about  abortion wich are in the middle of the issue.Abortion  depends of the situation of the parents in that moment and also if the mother has 
suffer of any manner, it could be good for the mother to finish with the prenancy or it could be reject by the parents.Other people think that the thechnique of abortion never must to be used  althounght the mother has been made violated or the baby has very difficult illnesses,in contrast there`re parents who say that the have created the child so they should have the fredoomto make the decision about wether the child should live or not.

To conclude, we can see that there`re many arguments defending and condemning abortion.Some said by the government,others arguments dictated by god  but in really the parents are who have to decide the future of the crature if it live or not..depends on the circunstances,the beliefs,the economic resources; we`re freedom to choose what we want for our future.Abortion is a  painful method but it swill be improve in thu future by the government basing on the ideas of other countries like:Scotland,Sweden.England...etc.
