Terrorism is a big social problem in our society that come from antiquity.The extremist groups who cause violent actions to get their political objectives are called terrorists.Six years ago, two airplanes crashed with the twin towers, lots of people dead and this fact had worldwide repercussion as there were few who got escaped. Since then EEUU's government has sent several armies to finish terrorism and to get more peaceful world.                                          Also, in Madrid, the Spanish capital, two years ago a terrorist attack also happened from Alkaeda -a terrorist Iraqui group- .That day, tens of people dead in a train in which they went to their schools or works, although many terrorist attacks happen in the area round Irak and inside Irak,too.All those events caused security changed in most countries.In this discussion essay I'll explain the differents opinions of people about security as a result of the war against terrorism.

There are several clearly opposed points of view concerning security as a result of the war against terrorism.Some people believe that nowadays we are surer because the police control on the streets and the airpot's controls have increased, this is may be true but this also cause a distrust and unfairness with any arabish people and since those terrorist attacks, xenophobia has notably increased in the most countries.An example could be when in England someone killed an arabish man by mistake, thinking that the man was a terrorist. In the other hand, some people claim that this war doesn't help to get a surer world and they are against the war can be a resource to finish with the terrorism. They think peace can't be gotten by means of a cruel war. It could be true but we need more safety on our streets to living without to be afraid of  to turn into terrorist victims. Actually in Irak and its surroundings there is a very strong tension between arabish poblation and terrorists don't dismiss the idea to carrry out a new terrorist attack in any city. In addition I could add it is true that many people would say that the situation to living in a surer world depends on country where people live and how their culture are. For example, if a child was born in Irak are less sure that a american or spanish child. This appears to be a more convincing argument, because violence go on existing in many small villages and cities.

To conclude, I can say the most reasonable opinion is thinking  safety always depends on  the place where you live. In Spain, the terrorist group ETA try to fight by means of  numerous murders to get the independence of their region, but Spanish government don't tolerate their purposes to go on killing to obtain their political principles and this situation could finish never. Although it's too dificult finding a good solution for this, but moral principles like tolerancy, respect, appreciation to live...we can only learn during our childhoood, so as we going to grow it will hader changing our moral principles. The best solution would be to become aware of the idea to respect each people and not to stolen something so important, prized and lovely like people life.
