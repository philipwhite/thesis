If we analyze a group of three people from Madrid, we get that one of them moves around using their own vehicle, (34% of population) another one uses the subway, bus or taxi (31%) and the last one goes walking (31%). However all of them prefer their own vehicles for this task. Another terrifying data is that in 1990 the number of vehicles in Spain was 309 per 1000 habitants and in 2006 there are 484 per 1000 habitants, in other words, one car for each two people of any age in Spain. In the other hand, any time it rains or there is an accident the traffic worsen and, some times, it gets so hard that vehicles does not seem to move at all. In this essay I suggest some possible solutions for the traffic problem in Madrid that, under my point of view, deal with people's way of life and public works mainly. 
     
     A good solution, in my view, is to convince people of using public transports more often. The more they use public transportation the fewer vehicles are needed to move around the core of the city. If we take a deep look into the latest statistics we can observe, that the use of the public transports has changed from a 59 per cent in 1996, to a 49 per cent ten years later, even though there has been an investment of 8.600 million of Euros in the last decade. I realize that 8.600 million is a big amount, but, if there has been an improvement in public transports, every time I take a look to a bus and see it crowded, I can't find out where that improvement is. The first part of this solution, seems to me that is for the state to make a real improvement, like they show us they could do the last 23d of September for "La noche blanca" when anyone could take a bus every five to ten minutes and move all around the centre of the city. In the other hand, and, in my opinion, this is the hardest part; there will be no use in getting a better public transportation if people don't make up their minds for changing their transport habits.
     
     One side of the traffic problem comes directly from the city infrastructure. Vehicles have increased considerably in the last decade but the roads for them have change little. There are several roads that surround the city like the M-40, the purpose for those is to house part of the traffic that otherwise would go trough the city. The solution I suggest here, and that I think is necessary for the rest to work, is to make those roads bigger, so that, there will be less congestion in the city centre. It is true that traffic in the M-40 would be the same, because the bigger it gets the more vehicles it will house, but, the solution for this is obvious to me, just make more surrounding roads; this will help with the city growing metropolis and with the traffic congestion. 
     
     The last solution related to this subject is, personally thinking, to decentralize Madrid. There are many working centres inside of Madrid, and lots of shopping places. My solution is quite simple, taking into account that the most of the traffic comes from the people that wants to get inside of the city, and neither from the "passing by" vehicles nor from the people getting outside of the city, I think that, if Madrid gets decentralized, and by this I mean to separate the leisure time places and the working centres from the core of the city where people lives, traffic will be reduced notoriously. It would be an utopia to think that shopping places in Madrid are going to be closed at the moment and that the working centres are going to be transfered in a short period of time, but, if the new ones to come are created outside of the city, and none are created inside, the old ones will close sooner or later and decentralization will come. 
     
     To sum up, public transports, city infrastructure and the decentralization of the core are the three main solutions for traffic problems in Madrid. In my opinion, it can be done, not as quickly as many of us would like, but, for it to come, all of us need to cooperate a little and the state must help and do something about it. My recommendation is to start right now, so that, the solution will come sooner for the traffic jams we suffer nowadays.
