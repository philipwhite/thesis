SOmetimes there are economic reasons, for example globalization, politic ones and in other cases child exploitation is a consequence of poverty or war. For that reason, in this essay I am going to argue what are , from my point of view, the principal causes of child exploitation and what are could be the possible solutions for the problem.


	UNICEF has developed a set of basic criteria to determine if the infantile work is exploiter or not. It defines that the infantile work is insuitable if:
- It is with exclusive dedication and at a too early age.
- Too many hours go working.
- (The ) work causes physical, social or psychological strees (ilegal).
- The child works and lives in the street in bad conditions.
- The wage is inadequate.
- The child must assume too much responsibility.
- Work prevents the access to school.
- Work mines the dignity and self-steem of the child (like slavery and the sexual exploitation).
- It prevents to obtain a total social and psychological development. The Convention on the Rights of the Childhood, signed in 1989 by all the countries except the Islands Cook, Somalia, Omán, Switzerland, the Arab Emirates United and EUA forces the governments to protect the children of  <Q>. Near 50 countries have ratified Convention 138 of the OIt on minimum ages to work, that establishes that 15 years-old id the acceptable minimum age in industrialized countries, and 14 years-old in the other countries. They allow that children make smooth works to the 13 years in industrialized countries and to the 12 in poorer countries. Forbids work that can threaten the health, security on the moral children smaller than 18 years.



	One of the main reasons of exploiting children is the political one; this is because in some countries (most belonging to the Third World) people are continually in war and consequences are always awful, especially for children. Most of the countries belongs to the Third World but others are very close to us. <Q> said Rotjana Phraesrithong of the Foundation for Slum Child Care in Klong Toey.


	A consequence of war is poverty and it is evident that a relation between infantile work and poverty exist, since the children who work are almost exclusively poor. But poverty is not the main cause of infantile work; the fact that the proportion of infantile work varies dramatically between countries of similar levels of economic development demonstrates it. In China, for example, there has been very little infantile work in last decades, according to diplomatic sources of  EUA, because they made the political decision to send the children to school. The same has happened in the Kerala state, in India, that has practically abolished it. Of these two example is deduced that infantile work only can exist if it is treated like acceptable cultural and politically.


	Maybe the most famous example of a poor country with child exploitation is Brazil. In this country during the 80s there were great changes in  the agricultural sector. Great plantations were mechanized more and more and its degree of dedication to the export was increased, and the fields were concentrated more and more in few hands of great agricultural companies. The workers of the plantations and the small agriculturists expelled from their fields joined themselves with the groups of temporary workers who knew like "boias frias" or "steering wheels". Since profits of many families diminished considerably, these employed children. Today, a good proportion of children who work in Brazil are "boias frias". Another example is Asia. In the Southeastern, urbanization and impoverishment of rural ecnomies are important factors that push families to sell their daughters to prostitution. The increase of infantile prostitution is bound to the growth of the sexual tourism, a specially bitter manifestation of globalization.


	Most of the children who work on time complete do it in commercial agricultural sector, but there are children working in multitude of sectors: domestic service, mining, fish of great depth (divers), construction, aport material, sport footwear, surgical equipment, matches and pyrotechnics, vegetal coal, crystal factories and ceramics. In India: enslaved, in quarries, the field, domestic service, picking rags in the streets, carpets, saris of silk, cigarettes "beedies", jewelery shop of silver, skin articles (including footwear and sport material), woven wool carpets by hand, synthetic and natural precious stones, diamonds, prostitution, restaurants, domestic work, and motels. Other example are coalmines in Colombia: the corridors of the mines are low and narrow, so propietors (habitually parents of the workers) find in children the ideal size workers. Bent and with difficulties to breathe, children load heavy coats of coal to their backs. They are exposed at high dust levels, with risk of injuries and pulmonary diseases. Is steemed that are hundreds of boys. But the clearest example that everybody knows is the production of balls. Great part of the sport material of the world takes place with infantile work. In Pakistan, the greater exporter of soccer balls (he provides more with 60% of the American market), for example, has more than 7.000 children of less than 14 years-old than they sew balls, receiving 0.6$ by ball; the greater children cannot even sew more than 3 or 4 balls in a day. Being under an intense scrutiny of the labor conditions of the plants where their sport slippers stick close to, Nike and Reebok announced that their balls would take the Guaranteed inscription: "done without infantile work" for the spring of 1997. The same month, Nike and a Pakistani company / signature opened a plant to sew soccer balls in which it was not going away to use infantile manual labor. Brick industry in Cambodia: the children usually work with the hands unprotected, and sometimes barefoot. Often they are cut at the hands and the bricks fall to their feet. some work with heavy machinery and many cut the hands or the fingers with the machines. More than half of the children interviewed by the Asian-American Free Institute Work they said to be in debt with his master. The greater complaint was the fatigue. 


	But infantile work is not an equal one. UNICEF makes a clear differentiation between two kinds of children work: Those than within the farmer's families or craftswomen work for themselves and by the situation of poverty, tha lack of infrastructure or the absence of social guarantees need the infantile arms. The boy can work along, but it is not possible to be spoken of operation but only of misery. Those in which they are exploded by an external pattern, often a multinational. ALso the work can be distinguished between the less serious cases- during some hours of the day, in sectors that do not harm the health or the growth and those more serious, that is to say the on time complete work and in unhealthy conditions.


	Consequences of the work for the children health are very serious. They suffer visual and bony injuries, deformations, numerous accidents, early death...Half of the children submissive unavoidable work in the Pakistan factories carpets never arrives at the 12 years, according to 1991 information. That same year Thailander Police dismantled an illegal factory of paper where they remained enslaved 31 adolescent children and it was commited to them to take amphetamines to fulfill a day labor of 18 hours by which they did not receive wage some. They were beaten to the smaller signal of revolt. The operation was possible thanks to one of the children that was able to escape and his father alerted to the security forces. When they acted, they verified that the children presented / displayed infections in the skin and burdens undernourishment; 28 of them neened psychiatric attendance by the serious trauma who suffered.


	To sum up, children exploitation is an actual problem although most of us don't worry enough about it, maybe because we can't see it in our developed societies or maybe because we are too selfish for worrying about people we don't know.
