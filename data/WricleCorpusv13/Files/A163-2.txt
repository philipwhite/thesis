But nowadays it is over the entire world, especially since September eleventh, 2001, affecting places like Bali, London, Madrid... However it is not a new phenomenon. Terrorism can be defined like the use of violence, especially murder and bombing, in order to achieve political aims or to force a government to do something. According to the writer Jessica Stern there are two characteristic that it differs from others violence forms: first, terrorism is concentrated in civilian population, and second, those who do to cause a strength impact on the population and that this is scare. They intend that a horror atmosphere will be in all people. This essay is going to tackle the subject if the world is a safer place as result of the war against terrorism on three specific aspects against, for and mid-point it, since these are probably the kinds of positions that most people are represented. 
	
     On the one hand those who think the world is not safer because some countries had fought against terrorism. This seems a logical opinion because the result of months and months of war is only deader and more terrorist attacks. For example the First World War can be consider like a result of a terrorist murder when in June,28th, 1914 a young, whom someone consider him like a hero , killed to the archduke Francisco Fernando, the inheritor of Austria's kingdom. The First World War was followed by the Second World War, characterized for concentration fields, massacre of innocent people, aerial attacks...
	
     On the other hand and contrasting with the first opinion, some people would claim that it is necessary to struggle for those that it is important or have caused lots of economical loss, spent of time, and the most important, people who have dead in a terrorist attack or people who have been victims of a cruel act of this type. They also claim that is not possible live getting ready to die in whatever moment. David Grossman, who lives in a violent country said: "This morning, when I woke up my son of eleven years old, he asked me: `Has the attack been yet? `" Then he added: "My son is afraid." In the last years thousands of children have dead in terrorist attacks. Some parents start to get ready to the moment when some of their children dead. "I could never forgot a young couple that tells me that they will marry and they will have three children, because if one of them died, they would have at least two"- Grossman wrote. They maintain that the only possible solution is fighting against those terrorist. Some of them prefer before starting a physical war, trying with a diplomatic war and if it does not go okay, then start the other, the physical. This method is doing frequently before beginning a war. The United Nations (UN) forces to the powerful countries to do it.
	
     Another possible opinion may be those who believe the war against the terrorism can be good and at the same time bad. It is bad because thousands and thousands of people die every week, moreover thousands have to be far of their families and houses, fighting nearly all day and being afraid if they could come back to their momentary "houses" alive... complicating the question is the highest quantity of money that the governments spends on wars and weapon, missiles, oil... Nevertheless it is good because if the government didn't do anything trying to stop the terrorism, we wouldn't probably be here yet because terrorists would have finished with us or they would have controlled us.  
	
     All these opinions are worthy, however the idea of not to do anything to try reducing terrorism seems impossible because the humans are vindictive almost without wanting. Furthermore most people don't live thinking if they will die in the next terrorist act, at least in Spain, unless it had happened other terrorist act recently or nearly. Mid-point opinions can be the best position to this issue because it is more or less equal balance of it.
	To conclude, this essay has considered three viewpoints to see the war against terrorism: people who don't agree with it others who agree with it and people who think that although war can never give us good things it is necessary do something to stop it. Considering all these points, it might be reasonable to work together to try to find a solution and everybody can live in peace.
