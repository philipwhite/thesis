refer ordinary themes like fashion,music,publicity of cosmetic products,sex,the 
importance of personal look...all they are common subjects at first sight,but,how 
do these magazines deal with those subjects and,the most important question,
how do the teenagers believe in this kind of information,what is the message they
grasp?If we read one of these magazines we can realize that an actual teenage's
image is far from the image of one of early ninety's decade. What kind of fenome-
non has provoked it?What was the process to get to this change?In following lines 
I'm going to write about this social process and its probably no-good future 
consequences.
Troughout  ten or fifteen years the language of these magazines has not changed 
enormously,but they gradually have introduced more and more phrases with 
agressive connotations when they refer to a famous person or some character 
created by the same publication express his or her personal opinion about a 
situation or another person.For example,in an article whose tittle was "Human 
Clones",there were three photographs with faces of Devorah Ombres,Marilyn 
Manson and the current Miss Spain;there was a question on the right:"Who were 
the judge on Miss Spain's election,The ONCE Co.? Is there or is not there 
agressiveness in that question? Another example I could find in the same 
magazine:three photographs,Brad Pitt,Mark van der Loo and Travis Fimmel;the 
text supporting these photos said:<Q> ,pointing up the last answer in red letters.
What is it creating when teenagers read this type of publications? Maybe a bad-thinking society?Why do we 
allow it,the normal circulation  of these magazines for people whose future maturity 
would can be disturbed?
Adolescence age is the period where the personal identity is shaping,when the 
ideas about reality are still confused,a period where the teenage wants to split up 
his or her parents and try to join to another kind of group,like friends,that is,he or 
she begins to mark some independence in his or her actions or thoughts,out of 
parents' control.This is a  fantastic attitude,because they are making their first 
steps to move in the life freely,but parents and adults must not forget these are 
immature steps and there is a long,long way to reach a complete vision of 
reality,above all on teenagers.They join between them,they share experiences,
secrets,bad or good moments...still with no-complete maturity ; if they don't receive 
good pieces of advices they can get frustrated or,in the worse case,they wiill do 
things that they could  regret ;so I think people with an objective vision about all 
reality aspects can help the youngers to choose the best way,the correct direction.
