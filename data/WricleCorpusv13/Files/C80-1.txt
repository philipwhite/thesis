In the case of the children, the lack of a suitable attention on the part of the parents ( who are often working all day ) lets them to accede without control to TV and Internet, if it is available in home, when they return from the school. In this essay I intent to describe the risks of a bad use of Internet, and to put forward my opinion against the constant, continuous, and bad use of Internet to a certain age and against those people who suffer from isolation or unemployment problems.
  From my point of view, if the familiar computer does not have filters that limit the access to inadequate pages, of accidental form or looking for new friends and stimuli they will be there with all class of contents and people. And what begins by curiosity it can finish in an addiction since children and adolescents are easily seductible. I would argue that unfortunately there are many parents who are not conscious of these dangers, that already the television and videogames occur partly with and that now they are multiplied in Internet, are omnipresent and more and more accessible to all in the houses, schools, cibercafes... Some people, those in favour of the constant use of Internet, argue that they frequently need information to make their activities, and often they can obtain it in Internet of a faster, comfortable and economic way that in the "physical world". 
  However, I believe that all of that entails some risks like Web pages that in spite of containing scientific information, can be unsuitable and until injurious ( it can affect its cognitivo and affective development ) for children and minors by the way that exists in which the subjects or the crudity of the images are approached ( sex, violence, drugs ). My opinion is also supported by the fact that unrecommendable information exists                                                   ( anorexy, pornography, violence, all type of sects... ) and until with considered criminal contents that they urge the violence, racism, xenophobia, terrorism, pedofilia, drug consumption, to participate in satanic rites and illegal sects, to make criminal acts... The globalidad of Internet and the different cultures and legislations from the countries make the existence possible ( at least temporary, since special groups of the police dedicated to computer science crimes make performances at international level ) of these Web pages in the cyberspace. 
  People often need to communicate with distant people, and some adolescents and persons who have feelings of isolation and loneliness argue that they need to make new social contacts. So they claim that Internet offers infinity of channels and opportunities to them ( email, chats, weblogs... ). Sometimes, of an unconscious way when  they participate in forums, personal, familiar information can be provided or from a third person to unknown people. And this always supposes a danger. Also it is frequent to make it through the forms of some Web pages that provide certain gratuitous services     ( mailboxes of email, digital lodging of Web pages, music and other resources... ). 
  Worst of all, specially in chats, it is possible to make contact with people who use false identities with unclear intentions, psychopaths that look for victims for violent acts or sometimes criminal that they promise stimuli, experiences and friendship.
  It seems to me that the cyberspace that sustains Internet is a parallel world in which all the activities can practically be made as we make them in the "physical world". And the activities with economic repercussion always suppose risks. Taking advantage of the regulation of activities in Internet, companies use sophisticated systems of marketing to seduce internauts and to urge to them the acquisition of their products. Its announcements of reclamation ( "banners"... ) which appear in all type of webs, and sometimes it is difficult to separate the own contents of the Web to the publicity. Also children and young people can make purchases without familiar control through Internet, sometimes even using the credit cards of known relatives. In addition, facilitating personal information and PIN numbers of the credit cards by Internet, sometimes are intercepted by "cyberthieves" and they use them to supplant the personality and to make purchases in the name of the owners.
  On the other hand, some people think that Internet can provide multiple pleasant sensations. The use of Internet depends on the personal circumstances of each one         ( some workers and students must be connected almost always to Internet ). It is difficult to establish the number of daily or weekly hours of connection; like alternative world to the "physical world", Internet offers infinity of supplies of leisure: readings, music, films, games, meetings, and each person can have his/her preferences. People look for information of all type: news, webs thematic, personal webs, services offered by companies... Often it includes pornography, images or scenes that include violence. Some users have tendency to communicate with well-known people, the addict ones look for to know new people and to look for the support in the groups of the network; sometimes several virtual personalities are created. Internet is full of type of games webs, some of them type casino ( very competitive ). In Internet, people can purchase, electronic commerce, auctions. From my point of view, more than a generis addiction to Internet, we can consider addictions or compulsive uses to determined contents or services.

  Apart from all these arguments, there is one which strongly supports my viewpoint: the violence is present in Internet in diverse scopes. There is infinity of Web pages that show violence and urge it:                                                                                                                                 - the terrorist pages of radical organizations and movements that they urge the violence and they try to justify violent facts ideologically.
- pages of violence promoted by illegal sects ( fanatical, satanic... )
- the pages related to the infantile pornography, pedofilia... 
- pages about tortures, murders...                                                                              Moreover, there is violent forums. Spaces of chat, weblogs and all type of virtual forums frequented by people and groups who speak on violent subjects, interchange compatible information and materials and prepare violent performances. However, I believe that the fight against these forms of violence in Internet requires in the first place a greater development of the legislation that regulates the use of Internet.
  I feel that one solution to the problem of a bad use of Internet which distort the normal life of the individuals would be the neccesary aid of friends and family, even specialistic doctors. We can consider that a person has addiction to Internet when his/her habitual way is incapable of controlling the time that is connected to Internet, relegating the familiar, social, and academic or professional obligations. In addition, they often spend the time in the computer instead of sleeping, and mealtimes are even reduced, so that the fatigue and irritability will last for a very long time, as well as the weakness of the immunological system, and frequently a certain tendency to the social isolation. 
  In the case of the minors, it is important that parents are kind to the use who make their children of Internet and detect these problems as rapidly as possible. A study made in November of 2002 by organizations of protection of childhood says that the following characteristics are considered a possible addiction to Internet: neccesity to be connected frequently, daily or almost daily, to be connected more than ten hours weekly, to look for sensations, to visit pornographic and violent pages, and to enter frequently chats creating different personalities and of opposite sex.
  To conclude, I have tried to show the different risks that result when a person uses Internet in a bad way. All the functionalities of Internet ( navigation by the Web pages, publication of weblogs and webs, electronic mail, forums, chats... ) can provide some risk, as it happens in the activities that we make in the "physical world". In the case of Internet, we have emphasized the risks that we have mentioned before.
