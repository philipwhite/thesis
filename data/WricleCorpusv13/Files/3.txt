and each country has chosen the one they think is better for its society. Recently, the 
effectivity of prison has been discussed in Spain because of its apparent lack of success 
in turning criminals into useful people for society. In Spain, when a criminal is sent to 
prison, there are plenty of things he can do to shorten his penalty - and even get some 
weekends of freedom - and very few opportunities to verify whether a criminal shows 
remorse or not from what he did in the past. In this essay I intend to point out the 
different aspects that, in my opinion, make prison fail.
       An undeniable proof that prison is not effective is the repetition of many former 
convicts in commiting crimes. The way I see it, when a child makes something wrong 
and is punished, he learns what is wrong and what is right, and learns from it. But when 
an adult commits a crime, in most of cases he knows he's doing something wrong, but 
he does it, no matter the consecuences. Staying in prison for some months or years will 
not teach anything good to somebody who commited a crime willingly. 
       Worst of all, prison may turn a man into a worse criminal than he was before 
entering it. A convict lives among many people who have commited crimes probably 
similar as his, and even some worse ones. Prison has always been known as a place in 
which, crime, drugs and violence is everywhere. If there is any little chance that a 
person "turns from dark to the light" in prison, it is instantly erased while living in those 
conditions. Different levels of crimes (it is not the same stealing something to eat than 
killing a human being) deserve different levels of punishment. And this difference 
shouldn't be present only in the ammount of time in prison, but also in the conditions of 
life. This is not possible to do due the fact that there is not enough money to spend on a 
prison, therefore there are very few measures or ways of controlling the people jailed 
there.
       On the other hand, there are cases where a social reinsertion is possible. Many 
people know the case of "El Lute", a Spanish thief that spent some years in prison 
studying a degree and became a lawyer. But we also shouldn't forget that a vast group 
of people who begin studying a university degree at prison are members of the Vasque 
terrorist group known as ETA, because they know that studying in prison helps shorten 
their penalties. Most disturbing of all is that some teachers of these students have 
claimed sometimes that they have been threatened with dead if these terrorists did not 
passed their degrees; other teachers do not because they are too afraid of them and pass 
their exams without telling it to the authorities.
       When a judge sends a criminal to jail, he does it knowing that they will not 
spend all the time he has dictated in prison. It is alarmingly frequent that criminals can 
make their time of imprisonment shorter only because they "behave", clean their cell, or 
do some work at the jail's laundry. It is not right that a murderer that was sent to jail for 
thirty years for killing innocent people is given a chance of leave prison only after ten 
years. It has been proved that some criminals act as if they were a new human being  to 
get some "freedom weekends" and after their first weekent out of prison they never go 
back to it, or much worse, they kill again; the only difference is that this time, those 
dead people could be alive if our laws (or judges) were not so weak.
       We shouldn't forget that prison takes freedom out from criminals so they 
normally spend there many years, and the conditions in many prisons are under an 
acceptable level. Human rights must be respected everywhere in the world if we are 
living under a democratic state, no matter the prisoners deserve it or not. Unfortunately, 
maintaining a prison full of people is not cheap, and I don't think non-jailed citizens 
would agree an uprise of taxes to increase the conditions of convicts. Prison, in some 
cases, allows some criminals to live with the same comforts as if they were in their own 
home. This was the case of a former director of the Spanish police, Lu�s Rold�n. He 
complained because a <Q>and incredibly got a TV, a DVD player and even a cell for his own. Needless to say, he 
didn't pay it; all Spanish people did it with part of our taxes. Knowing that, it's not hard 
to believe the story of a man who commited a robbery with a gun in one hand, in order 
to be sent to prison and leave his life as a begger. People in prison get food, clothes and 
a place to live for free and I think they should be made to earn it working, helping 
somehow other people, making something positive for society.
       To conclude, I have tried to show the failure of the system of imprisonment 
pointing out the fact that most exconvicts return to crime when they go out of prison, 
considering the awful reality that prison turn a man into a worse criminal than he was 
before entering it; and more important, something should be done with Spanish law, 
because criminals hardly spend all the time they were sentenced in prison. But we 
shouldn't forget that there are cases where a social reinsertion is possible and that, as 
human beings people jailed deserve that their human rights are respected. 


 



      Two years ago, the United States of America began what they called a 
preventive attack over Irak. The United States justified their attack affirming that there 
was proof that Irak was in possession of massive destruction weapons, a kind of 
chemical weapon banned by U.S.A., and therefore, they had to take control on the 
country to ensure freedom and safety in the world. Some countries supported this 
preventive attack while others were against it. After almost three years of conflict, no 
massive destruction weapons have been found, Saddam Hussein is on trial, and Irak is 
still on chaos. Was the invasion necessary? Is Irak now a safer country? Did U.S.A. 
liberate or invade Irak? In this essay I intend to analyse the different points of view of 
this matter.

      Saddam Hussein became president of Irak in 1979 and he immediately got rid of 
any oposition: <Q> <R>. Irak was definitely a country that needed 
international intervention for a long time. According to a former Iraqi diplomat who 
described Saddam's rule in one sentence: <Q> <R>. 
In my opinion, Europe and U.S.A. should have joined forces a long time ago to solve 
the problem of Irak, because a dictatorship cannot be allowed in the 21st century. 
However, I think that bombing Irak was not the best solution for the problem, as U.S.A. 
did; instead, I think that eliminating Saddam Hussein and controlling the country would 
have been enough.
	Many people in the United States were very furious because of what happened in 
the World Trade Center. They were thirsty for vengeance, and their president served it: 
<Q> <R>. Although I consider vengeance is a primary and natural feeling for 
human beings, I consider that feeling was manipulated by the American government, 
luring people to believe that war was necessary. I also think that relating directly the 
September 11th attacks with Irak was unfair, because Irak population were not guilty 
and they suffered a cruel and massive attack that caused hundreds of casualties.  
Moreover, I do not think that the government of U.S.A. acted upon desires of revenge, 
but under a careful strategy designed to invade a country full of petrol.

      The existence of weapons of mass destruction were the reason why U.S.A. 
attacked and invaded Irak. They presented a great number of proof that there were still 
weapons of mass destruction in Irak to convince them that the Irak menace was real and 
almost imminent. Months later, when the war had begun, the previously shown proof 
was revealed to be a hoax, but it had neither any consequences to the government, nor 
the war was stopped. From my point of view, U.S.A. had designed a plan to invade Irak 
and use their petrol at will, but they lacked the most important thing to start their plan: a 
reason. So I think they made it up, and they hoped everybody believed their tale, some 
did, and some did not, but the immense majority of people knew that the attack was 
inevitable, and that U.S.A. would do anything to invade it, even ignoring the United 
Nations. 
	Irak had certainly used weapons of mass destruction against Iran in the past, that 
is a fact, but the presence of that kind of weapons nowadays could not be proved. In 
contrast, the ones who really had weapons of mass destruction were the U.S.A., using 
 "white phosphorus" in Irak, which is a chemical that burns skin down to the bone and 
can not be extinguished with the use of water: <Q> <R>. I find it very hypocritical that the U.S.A., which began a war 
against an innocent country accusing them of having weapons of mass destruction, used 
this kind of weapons and now they admit it publicly. I think the whole world should 
create an alliance against the U.S.A. governement and make them be judged for their 
lies and crimes.

	However, while some people claim that Irak is in a much worse and chaotic 
situation than three years ago, others think that Irak is a now a free country. Before the 
attack, there was no democracy in Irak; Saddam Hussein was its permanent and a 
ruthless president, so something had to be done. After the attack, an election could be 
celebrated. Through history, stronger and more advanced societies have invaded other 
more primitive, and have transformed the primitive societies into relatively modern 
states. From my point of view, whether Irak will be seen as a modern society some 
years in the future is a mystery. I think that democracy cannot be impossed, but muy 
opinion is relative to my perception of reality, which is framed by my knowledge. 
Perhaps this is the only way that some societies evolve. The fact that we do not like how 
the world changes does not mean it is good or bad. Changes are sometimes inevitable, 
and nature has shown us that the strongest survive and the weakest die, so nature does 
not share our view of  justice.

	To conclude, Irak is in some ways better than three years ago, and in others 
worse. They were attacked without mercy using a bad lie as an excuse, displaying 
weapons of mass destruction, killing innocent people, and stealing their petrol, their 
main source of income. That is clearly an unjustified invasion. On the other hand, no 
one fears anymore the tirany of Saddam Hussein, and the first signs of democracy, such 
as an election, are begining to appear in Irak. We should not forget that, in many cases, 
invasions have proved to be beneficious, because that is how former societies became 
part of bigger empires in the past. Although I dislike war very much, maybe it is the 
only way of evolving for some societies.
