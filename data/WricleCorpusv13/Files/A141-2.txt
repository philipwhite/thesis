	The war against terrorism helded mainly by USA, and other supporting countries like Spain, Italy, Japan or UK, has generated controversy over the last five years. It seems that this war was initiated as a response to the attacks suffered by the USA in September 11, 2001. The inicial response from USA was the bombing of Afghanistan to attack Osama Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network and the Taliban Government. After this, USA lead the war against Iraq in the operation developed to fight the denominated 'axis of evil'. During this war, the terrorists attacked Spain in March 11, 2004, UK in June 7, 2005, and have threatened with more attacks the other countries which have supported these wars. It seems that the consequences of this unfinished war are still being suffered nowadays all over the world. In this essay I will try to explain some of the main viewpoints dealing with the safety of the world after this war against terrorism.

	To begin with, there are many people who seem to think that the world is now a safer place. The majority of this people seem to think that, after the wars, the democracy systems that are trying to be implemented in Afghanistan and Iraq may allow the inhabitants of these countries to live more freely. If these people aren't under a dictatorial system, their way of life might be also safer because it looks like they will be able to determine their own future and able to choose their leaders instead of being directed by dictators or religious leaders who can obligate them to fight against the western countries in the name of religion or other political reasons.
       
       Although the point of view seems to be reasonable, it has some weaknesses. Maybe the citizens from these countries didn't want to change their political systems or wanted to change them by their own ways. These changes could be considered as impositions made by western countries and some of the terrorists from middle-eastern countries could possibly think about new attacks in retaliation for this. But, there is also a lot of people, for example in Iraq, that are participating in demonstrations against the terror in their country and the terrorism all over the world like the ones organizated by the Anti-Terrorism Popular Committee since 2003.

	On the other hand, it appears that a lot of people think that the world probably won't be safe anymore. It appears that several zones that are still occupated by the UN soldiers are used by some of the terrorist as a training camp. They can fight there against possibly the better armies in the world, like the USA's or Uk's, they have what it looks like the best training enviroment because they don't have to simulate nothing and they can also try their terrorism weapons against real people. Furthermore, the attacks that were helded in Madrid and London shown to nearly all the world that the terrorists aren't afraid to die in the name of what they believe. And these attacks created perhaps more panic amongst the western citizens than the ones in USA because taking security measures in an airport seems to be easier than taking them in public transports, such buses, trains or the tube, used by presumably the majority of the citizens in the big cities.

	This argument could be considered as a realistic perspective, but we should think also that many of the countries threatened by the terrorists, because of their implication in Afghanistan and Iraq wars, withdrawn their troops from the zone and they aren't under the thread of terrorism right now -or maybe only while the troops they have there keep being in pacific misions to help the citizens in these countries and not to fight against them-. But we can't forget that it seems that USA is still under these threads because this country was the one which started the fight against and named them the 'axis of evil'.

	Of course, there are other viewpoints that depend on the circumstances. Some people can't think about a more dangerous or a safer world maybe because their countries weren't involved in these wars, are very small, very far or haven't a representative person in the UN so they don't want to interfere in order to avoid the problems that the other countries are suffering. Other people may think that nowadays we are in an inflection point and the safety of the world will depend on the decisions our leaders are taking. Therefore, this viewpoint has implicit other ones. 

       First of all, we have several people who think that it could be that in a future other countries could use the same policy as USA -it seems to be like the one used by Iraq when it invaded Kuwait- to take advantage of countries which are weaker than them and the wars will have no end because surely always will be countries which come in defende of the others. Other people think that the situation could be like the cold war, without changes in a long period of time and then it will end with a friendly and mutual disarm to give rise a period of world peace. And there are other ones who think that this situation will only go down and it will be end with another worldwide war because it appears that none of the leaders of the main countries involved will stop until they win.
       
       In conclusion, there are people who appear to think that the safety of the world has risen because the democratic system will make the middle-east citizens able to choose their own future and not fight against the western countries for reasons given by their leaders. Some terrorist may not agree with this political system but a higher numbers of inhabitants will do. Other people seem to think that the world isn't safer because Iraq looks like the ideal training camp for terrorists and they can commit attacks against targets that are hard to defende in the big cities but the majority of the countries involved in the war aren't now under threads. Other viewpoints that we have to think about when discussing this issue are that several countries don't want to get involved in the war and its consequences. A lot of people think that we are in an inflection point that has some exits. The first exit is the continuation of the wars, the second is a period of tension with a friendly end and the third one is another worldwide war if our leaders aren't capables of find a solution for a problem that seems to be created by themselves.
