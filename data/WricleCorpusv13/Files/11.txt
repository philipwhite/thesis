Since abortion became legal, it has been a very controversial issue. Everyone has got an opinion on it; it is a theme which doesn't seem to leave anyone indifferent. The artificial abortion occurs when the gestating baby's parents decide they don't want to have it, that they prefer it not to be born. Along the history of the social acceptance of abortion, there have been many strong opinions about it, mainly supported by the church, some governments and of course society. These are the three main viewpoints on abortion which I am going to analyse in this essay.

To begin with, there are several arguments against abortion, supported mainly by the church and other religious institutions. They claim that a baby, of any age or weeks of gestation is already a life, therefore it shouldn't be killed, because it is alive. The support for this argument is obviously religious, because they argue that it is not men's duty to deprive someone from his/her own life, but God's. Many actions in many countries have been carried out by religious institutions, asking the government to ban abortion, or at least to make it more difficult for parents to abort: They want to make the time for abortion shorter (less weeks of margin). This point of view isn't only shared among religious people, but it is also shared among the more conservative fraction of population, which isn't small, so their opinion is loud in our society nowadays.

Some arguments in favour of abortion are maintained, mostly, by the left-wing government and political parties and by the most liberal fraction of society. On their behalf, they claim that it is the parent's responsibility to decide if they want to carry on with the pregnancy or not. It is them who have in fact created the baby, therefore it is no-one's decision but theirs to make. Not everyone who is in favour of abortion have the same opinion on it: some are more radical than others. A fraction of them think that it is correct to undertake an abortion at any point of the pregnancy (making sure the mother isn't in danger), and others think abortion should only be possible up to about the fourteenth or sixteenth week of pregnancy. Opposing to this point of view over abortion, many people have made allusion to the right every human being has got to life, arguing that with abortion, parents would be denying this right to their unborn child.

There are other arguments regarding abortion which depend on the specific conditions of each specific situation. This viewpoint is supported mainly by the rest of the society, who proclaim themselves to be neither liberal nor conservative, but neutral. They argue that many factors have to be taken into consideration, such as the parent's ages, their psychological and physical conditions, etc. For example if the child's mother is so young that her physical integrity will be in danger during the delivery or some time before it, their answer to his is to carry on with the abortion. Another example which people with this viewpoint give is the fact that in many places, many girls are raped, so therefore, they propose as most reasonable answer that the mothers are or will be psychologically affected by this; the most recommendable option is to undertake an abortion.

In conclusion, it is obvious that there are many viewpoints concerning the complicated theme of abortion: some condemn it, others are in favour of it and others, are neutral and take into account the personal circumstances of each person who encounters this difficult decision. Concerning all of the three viewpoints presented in this paper, it is important to underline that nowadays, there are some established laws concerning abortion. If these laws are studied, it is obvious that they have been made so that each individual, respecting some pre-established broad margins, does whatever is more in accordance to his or her moral


Secondary School is up to 18 years in many countries. Secondary School is the last stage in the obligatory education, it comes after Primary School. Its purpose is to make the student be able to continue with higher studies or to face the working world with a better preparation. Secondary School is up to 18 years in countries such as Spain, Argentina, Chile, USA, Great Britain or Australia. However everybody does not agree with the length of this stage of a student's life. Yet I personally believe that Secondary School up to 18 years has many advantages and in this essay I intend to consider why it is better for the students' formation.

First, Secondary School up to 18 prepares those people who want to continue their studies at University. It appears to me students are better prepared for the degrees they chose at University because Secondary School is divided in different groups of subjects that interests in the different specialities. For instance, these groups are the study of science or humanities. As a result students study only what they interest for their following studies at University. Of course, it could be argued that students have to be studying up to very advanced ages and they seem to be in a kind of "jail" against their will, so it prejudices them because they should be working or studying other studies that really interest them. This maybe partly true, but I would argue that students haven't got enough maturity to decide what they want to do before 18, so I find useful to study up to that age to have time to make up our mind.

It also prepares people who want to work. For example, in Spain there are some courses in Obligatory education called "M�dulos", they are divided in medium and high ones. The "M�dulos" prepare people who want to work in a specific job, and when these people finish them at the age of 18, they straight away get their job. It must be said that these people who want to work instead of continue their studies at University would prefer to start working before, and the "M�dulos" mean a period of two years in which people could have been working, but it does show that young people nowadays only care to earn "fast-money" and they don't think about what will happen with their future without the proper preparation.

Finally, to be studying until 18 helps to form the student personality. Apart from the different subjects students learn about, secondary education gives people some values to form their personality. For instance, people who chose a religious education have different points of view than people who receive a normal one, and it helps them to be able to support their ideas and have their own arguments about every topic of our life. On the other hand, this kind of education might annul the person's true personality and not let them chose other way of thinking but it seems to me people who study more has more culture, as a result, a better formed personality.

To conclude, obligatory education until 18 has many advantages because it complete the people's background who want to go on studying, it also helps those students that don't want to continue studying and prepares them for working and finally it provides the student with a well-formed personality. However, I think obligatory education up to 18 isn't approved by everybody and even more in the future and I think these people will have a serious lack of cultural background that isn't learnt in any place but school.
