In this essay, I would try to give some of the posible solutions to the traffic problem in Madrid.From my point of view, this is one of the most important problems, not only in our country, but also in every country of the world.It seem to me that one of the most important ways of solving this problem is by improving the public transport, but there are other different solutions too.One posible solution, could be for example to make the public transport lines bigger.What do I mean by bigger?I mean to make lines more direct to different places, so that people don't have to change so much of carriage,bus...So that it is more comfortable for users.We can also make more lines,by engaging more people to work in public transport,this will give us more speed.Another posible solution, could be to decrease the price of public transport tickects, so that it is more economic than using your car and paying your petrol.Although,some people think, that the only way of solving the problem of traffic, is by making aware of the importance of this problem and its consequences.Consequences like pollution or traffic accidents.In my opinion, there are more solutions that can work,not only by making aware of the problem. For example, we can increase the price of cars,if we do this, not everyone could have a car,and with the improving of public transport ofcourse, traffic will decrease.Another possible solution is to make a law in wich you can only have a number of cars in each familly or house, I mean by this, that if there is a law that provides to have a number of cars,dependings on each case,then people of the same familly or living place, will share the cars and we will have less traffic.
In the other hand, it is true that going to every place in your own car,is much more comfortable.With your car you have your own space,you don't have to be next to an unknown person.It is aslo true, that you decide the leaving hour,without having to wait.Another advantage, is that in your car you can, normally, choose the temperature you want to have in that momment.But, if we make more lines of public transport we won't have to wait until it comes, because we will have more public transport working, so that we can leave at any hour without any problem.Also nowadays we have air conditioned and electric heating in every public transport, so you can have a good temperature in it.
In conclusion, I think this problem can be easily solved by trying every different solution, until we reach the one that makes everyone happy,until then we will have to live with the problem of traffic in our country,Madrid.
