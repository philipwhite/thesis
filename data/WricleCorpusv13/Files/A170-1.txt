In this essay I'm going to expose my point of view about these problems and the solutions that I think would be appropriate for them.
The first problem is immigration. I think that people can go to every place they want besides their nationality or the colour of their skin if they want to have a better life, salary or education because in their countries there are weaknesses in these aspects. Of course they must have their passports regulated. However it's true that some of them are illegal immigrants and criminals who come there for commit robbery and murders. But they are only few persons that don't represent the immigrants. My solution for this problem is the better regulation of the immigrants that enter in our country by putting more police in the frontiers and repatriating the illegal immigrants that have arrive here in boat crossing the sea. Other way is regulate the immigrants that have been working here since one or two years and give more working licenses for avoid the massive entrance in the country.
The second problem is related to the first problem. My personal opinion is that nobody can hate a person for the colour of his skin, his nationality or his status because nobody is better than anybody and everybody has the right to go wherever they want without be hated. Lots of people hate immigrants and foreigners because they think that these people steal the jobs that a person of the country can do, but for me this is not true because if the foreigners obtain these jobs is because they are better prepared or it is a job that nobody wants. My personal solution is increase the education of this people in especial classes living together with foreigners or working together to learn that the foreigners are not bad or different people. Other way is by television. With the publicity and the programs we can see black or Asiatic people interacting with natives and finally people will see foreigners like something closer and normal.
The last problem is the domestic violence, which is a problem that is increasing in developed counties. I strongly believe that the person that hurts his o her partner must be in prison because you can't mistreat the person whom you have promised eternal love. You can't pay with him or her your own frustrations because if you do that you're nothing but a criminal. Some of these criminals say that they have killed their partners because they love them. I think that it's stupid because if they had love their partners they wouldn't have killed them. The solution that I propose is to harden the justice to maintain these criminals in jail a big quantity of years for punish them. The police also can increase their actuation is case of violence or denunciation. Finally the criminals can be educated to integrate themselves in the society and maintain their marriages.
In conclusion, we have seen the four problems that I think are the most worrying these days. Other people have different opinions from me and all the opinions are valid. But I believe that in the future these problems will be solved. This is duty of the government that must give solutions like better regulation of the immigrants, increase the education for avoid the racism and harden the justice for the criminals. These are my solutions but there could be much more.  I hope that in the future we can talk that these problems have been solved. For solving these problems everybody has to involve in this and people must not live thinking that anything affects them. It's a social issue and it concerns everybody.
