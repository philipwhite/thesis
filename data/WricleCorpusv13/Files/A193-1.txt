    Madrid, like a big european capital, is the centre of a lot of differents indurtries,  trades and bussines, for this, there is a continuous amount of people running around. All  this movement suppose an excesive use of cars and bus in the rush horus throughout a  day and like result, their principal streets are usually a real chaos. There are some  different problems related to the traffic in Madrid, and for that, in this essay I will try to  suggest some of the possible solutions that I think could (maybe) change this problem which "madrileños" look like a normal thing.             There are some different solutions to try to solve this traffic. Firs at all I would like to talk about the pedestrian streets and pedestrianized areas. In Madrid there aren't  a great number of zones only for pedestrians,  and in my view is an efective way to avoid cars for example in the centre. That can seem can expensive change for politicians, but in my opinion itis an effective step to "the change".      Another possible solution can be to run better the public tranport in Madrid.  I personally believe that  the building of more subway or the simple development of new  routes to bus are, in my own view, a feasible solution. Agaisn can be looked like a difficult step for the great expense but, if people would understand thas public transport is (with that changes) more confortable and and faster, they will provably chose it.     In some other countries in Europe, bicicle is an usual way of transport. My personl opinion of this is that, bikes are vehicle  small than cars ( this supose more  space for marking, driving...), moreover I believe is healthy for different reasons; is  non-pollutant and is a caind of sport that help us to keep our heart strong. If the town  hall would try to promote transport by bicicle in Madrid, is posible that a lot of people  (specially young people) will choose  that caind of vehicle, making fall the number of  cars in the streets.      Another point can be roadwors. My own opinion is that soe little changes in a number of streets in the centre  and maybe in the outskirts in needed. There are a lot of old signals and lights. Also a great number of very narrow streets that are alowed to driving. All that supose an usual disorder in driving, or this I believe that are needed  some roadworks which try to canalize the traffic in different  areas far to the centre and  furthermore the development of new  radial roads and ring roads which help to canalize  it.                Moreover it could be arged that it is no possible because to change all this  material, modernice lights, to make all that roadworks could result too much expensive  and a not sure way to try all those changes. Nevertheless I would suggest that if they try  to develope some steps of that idea, they'll found some solutions for tha traffic problem.                Furthermore, a different solution can be  make an area with traffic acces but  subject to control. Could be made a cain of "road taxs area". In that way, I think, people  who would to use that area for driving will must to pay, for this reason a lot f people  would to choose  another road. Can be suggested that it's an utopical solution but is  highly similar to the parking zones with parking meter in Madrid. A relative control  could suppose, in my opinion, a real change and another step up.                 In conclusion, talking abut the problem that traffic suppose in Madrid, and  looking some differnt problems, I think that a lot of  possible solutions can be found.  Develope a better serve of public transport, become some areas in pedestrianized zones  or try to promove bikes like way of transport are some of my particular ideas to try to  climb and obtain results. Some of those ideas can look like utopical but are only little  steps in a high "road". I really believe that, we must try to do something because it's a  problem that is increasing and all their consequences will be bigger and bigger.
