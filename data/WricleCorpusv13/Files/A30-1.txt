    After waiting for so long, a few months ago, in Spain, gay marriages were approved by  the government. Now many homosexual couples queue to get married. However, most of the  people don't agree with this law and sometimes they treat them as if they have a contagious  disease. I think this treatment has been encouraged by the Catholic Church because it doesn't  accept homosexuality at all. This is due to the idea from the Bible that a "couple" is a man and  a woman and they must get married to have children. In this essay I intend to argue that, in  my own view, gay people should be respected and should be allowed to adopt children like  any other couple that cannot have them by a natural way.          Firstly, I believe that all couples have the right to benefit from the advantages that the  marriage has: lower taxes, inheritance in case that one member of the couple die, to get  widow's pension, and so on. In my opinion, it doesn't matter if they're straight or homosexual.  Some people may think however, that a gay couple cannot have a proper marriage because  this word implies a man and a woman. Personally speaking, I feel that the word marriage is  just that, a word, and if people don't agree, they can always use another word. A couple is just  two people that love each other. Besides that, nobody should judge people for their partners.          Secondly, marriage also has a purpose: to create a family, to conceive children. This is  understandable, in my opinion, but as couples with problems for having children have the  possibility of adopting them, so the gay couples should have that possibility too. It could be  argued that a situation like that can be confusing for the children, even some people think that  those children will become homosexual themselves when they grow older. I strongly feel that  this is a wrong thought, sometimes it can be a better atmosphere and more tolerance and love  in a gay couple and therefore, the children learn to respect and tolerate.          Finally, I believe a child needs love, comprehension, care and a good education. Gay  people are capable enough of offering these things to children. It is not necessary a man and a  woman to grow up someone. In some "normal" families children can turn out to be juvenile  delinquents: thieves, pickpocket, shoplifters, and so on. That doesn't exclude the possibility of  a problematic boy or girl that has been grown up by a gay couple. What I'm trying to say is  that it doesn't matter if a child has two fathers, two mothers or a father and a mother. What  really matters is that those two people were ready and willing to be a good example to follow.  To educate children, in my opinion, is a difficult subject and nobody, nowhere teaches you  how to do it. The only thing that it is important is that parents whether straight or homosexual  try to do the best to educate properly their children.          In conclusion, I think gay people should have the same rights as straight people. They  should get married and they should be allowed to adopt children, even if some people don't  consider the union of two people with the same sex, to be a marriage because this word can be  changed, this is only another excuse to complain about homosexuality. I personally believe  that the government should allow gay marriages the possibility of adoption. That would be  something that should approximate them to be treated equally.
