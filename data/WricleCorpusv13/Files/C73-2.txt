The institution of marriage has been in a state of constant change for centuries. In the   United States, it was only after the civil war that African-Americans were allowed to   marry; and it was not until 1967 that a decision from the U.S Supreme Court allowed   mixed race couples to marry. Until recently, same-sex couples could not marry   anywhere in the world. In April 2001 Holland was the first country to legalize   homosexual marriages by expanding its definition of marriage to include, apart from   opposite-sex couples, same-sex couples. Ever since, this issue has been one of constant   debate in western societies. In this essay, I will try to give different points of view   regarding the right homosexuals have to get married and I will also discuss whether or   not they should have the right to adopt children.      From the point of view of those who stand in opposition, homosexuals do not have the   right to marry because, though marriage is a right, it is a natural right based on the   biological need to procreate. Therefore, the definition of marriage should be restricted to   the union of a man and a woman. These heterosexual marriages are, from this point of   view, considered essential as a means of procreation and in order to lay the foundations   of the family unit and of civilization. It is also argued that homosexual relationships   can by no natural or biological means lead to reproduction, that is, that they are sterile   by definition. From this point of view, marriage is seen as the social codification of an   evolved long term mating strategy, with economic and legal benefits to facilitate family   growth and stability.       One of the most powerful arguments against homosexual marriages is that marriage is   traditionally between persons of opposite sex. Therefore, the opposite sex of the   partners is a fundamental attribute of marriage and same-sex couples can not get   married. This leads to another argument, that whatever sort of union same-sex couples   are joined in, it is not marriage. It has been argued that same-sex couples should be   given the right to join in some kind of union, and several names have been proposed   such as "civil union", "same-sex union" or, even, "same-sex marriage". This would help   to create a new kind of relationship with it's own regulation, a specifically same-sex   relationship, but different from marriage.          One of the main arguments that are usually put forward to defend homosexual   marriages is that, since homosexuals are treated by the law in the same way as   heterosexuals when it comes to obligations, they should also be treated in the same   way when it comes to rights. This is one of the main reasons for which homosexual   couples lay so much emphasis on being included in the definition of marriage and don't   just conform with having a special kind of union reserved for partners of the same sex.   Homosexuals that want to marry each other want to have a real marriage. The advocates   of homosexual marriages would argue that it's not about the actual ceremony itself but   about the legal and financial protections and benefits that are given to married couples.   These benefits range from tax relief to medical decision making on behalf of the   partner. So it is argued that by receiving these same benefits, homosexual couples   would be provided with a strengthened relationship and a stable family structure.       The religious point of view should also be taken into account. The Church teaches that   respect for homosexual persons cannot lead in any way to approval of homosexual   behaviour or to legal recognition of homosexual unions. The common good requires   that laws recognize, promote and protect marriage as the basis of the family, the primary   unit of society. Legal recognition of homosexual unions or placing them on the same   level as marriage would mean not only the approval of deviant behaviour, with the   consequence of making it a model in present-day society, but would also obscure basic   values which belong to the common inheritance of humanity. The Church cannot fail to   defend these values, for the good of men and women and for the good of society itself.       Nevertheless, there are also important arguments in favour of gay marriages. Let's   look at some of them. Those that argue in favour usually wonder why should one set of   loving, consenting adults be denied a right that other such adults have and which, if   exercised, would do no damage to anyone else. From this point of view, the question   about the real nature of marriage immediately arises. People in favour of homosexual   marriage would answer that marriage is a binding commitment, at once legal, social and   personal, between two people to take on special obligations to one another. Therefore, if   homosexuals want to make such marital commitments to one another, and to society,   then they should not be prevented from doing so.         Now, we have seen some points of view regarding this issue but there is something   else that we should take into account and that is whether same-sex couples should have,   in case of getting married, the right to child adoption. This certainly doesn't seem to be   a minor issue because, in some cases, it is precisely this what inclines people to the   acceptance or not of homosexual marriages. Let's take a look at some points of view   regarding child adoption by same-sex couples.      First, we should consider the different arguments concerning gender roles. Some   opponents of adoption by same-sex couples question whether these couples would be   able to provide children with adequate gender roles. The underlying sentiment is that,   without both male and female role models, children may develop in such a way that   they might be unable to fulfill traditional gender roles in future heterosexual   relationships. The argument that same-sex parents are unsuitable hinges on the   assumption that children of single parent households suffer due to a lack of gender role   models, whereas those in favour of child adoption by same-sex couples argue that the   cause for this may instead be a lack of parental care and supervision associated with   single parent households. Therefore, children would be better growing up with a   homosexual couple than in a single parent household.          Secondly, we should also take a look at some of the arguments relating to children's   sexual orientation. The debate here basically has to do with whether or not children that   have been raised by homosexual couples are more likely themselves to be homosexual   as adults. Evidence from studies suggests that it is a mixture of biological and   environmental factors what determines sexual orientation, although there is currently no   scientific consensus on what specific environmental factors contribute to determine   this. A number of studies comparing children raised by two mothers and those raised by   a mother and a father have not found any relation between same-sex parenting and a   greater likelihood of being later on in life gay or lesbian.       Finally, let's look at some arguments concerning parent's fitness for the adoption of   children. There is a substantial amount of studies that support the conclusion that, under   similar socioeconomic conditions, children raised by same-sex couples are comparable   to those raised by opposite-sex couples in terms of their mental and physical health. But    those who oppose to adoption by same-sex couples argue that gays and lesbians are   more prone to mental disorders than are heterosexual persons, that same-sex couples are   more likely to expose a child to negative influences and, therefore, such children are   more likely to suffer development problems.This leads them to conclude that    households of married heterosexual couples provide the most stable environment for   children, and that same-sex couples should not be permitted to adopt children.  Nevertheless, those favourable to gay adoption would reply that this argument is based   on a generalization and does not necessarily apply to individual same-sex couples; and   that extensive evaluations of individual prospective parents are a standard prerequisite   for adopting children, regardless of the prospective parents' gender and/or sexual   orientation.       To sum up, we have seen some arguments against same-sex couples getting married   such as the one that sees marriage as a natural right for the sake of procreation, or the   one that establishes marriage as a traditional union between persons of opposite sexes.   We have also seen the religious view of this issue which, although it respects   homosexuality, doesn't approve their behaviour nor their getting married. We have   also seen arguments in favour of gay marriages, such as the equality of rights. Finally,   we have analised several arguments both in favour and against the right to adopt children by same-sex couples, arguments concerning gender roles, children's sexual identity and whether homosexual couples are fit or not to adopt children. To conclude with, I have tried to give an overall view of this issue which, it seems, will still for some time give rise to a strong debate.
