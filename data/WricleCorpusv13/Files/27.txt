Is it morally acceptable for young adults to engage in the sex act prior to marriage? This 
is a question that has been under debate for a long time. Approval of premarital sex also 
increased between 1943 and 1999, from 12 percent to 73 percent among young women, 
and from 40 percent to 79 percent among young men, according to a report published in 
the September issue of the Review of General Psychology <R>. The 
traditional Christian moral maintains that sexual intercourse is to be reserved for 
marriage and procreation, while more liberal people think that it should not be only part 
of marriage, and even there are others who are against of marriage at all (but not against 
sex), or against sex, but not marriage. In this essay, I will present the different opinions 
held in relation to this topic.

The main position against sexual intercourse before marriage is the one of the Christian 
Catholic Church. For them, sex before marriage is sex without commitment and sex that 
is not aimed to procreation, so it is equal to sin. They define this premarital relations as 
situations that <Q> <R>. The Biblical condemnation of sexual relations before or outside marriage is 
abundantly clear. Adultery, or sexual intercourse between married women or married 
men and someone other than their marital partners, is condemned as a serious sin. <Q> <R>.. Here Paul admonishes those who had sexual 
urges to satisfy them by entering not into temporary relationships <R> but into permanent marital relationships. Such 
relationships are to be characterized by <Q> <R>. Besides other churches and religions (such as Judaism, Islamism, 
American Baptists, Letter-day saints...) have a similar attitude to premarital sex, 
naming it sinful and irresponsible. The fact that you can get involuntarily pregnant or 
catch a sexually transmitted disease is something that should also be taken into account 
and something that people against premarital sex use to support their viewpoint. This 
idea of premarital sex being not good for the relationships is also illustrated by research, 
which shows that couples who engage in pre-marital sex are more likely in the long-
term to divorce, although there is not necessarily a direct causal link <R>

This seems to be a rather logical position, having into account Christian beliefs and the 
ideas proposed by other religions, so the main problem here is faith. If someone is a 
believer then the argumentation will be clear for him or for her, but people not agreeing 
with that religion might find it difficult to justify his or her behaviour according to these 
rules. The idea of sin seems very subjective, but on the other hand, it can be seen as 
something irresponsible or leading to divorce, so if it is accepted as not being a good 
consequence, then the argument becomes stronger, and it might help to convince more 
people.

There are also people who think that having sex prior to marriage is not bad, but a 
matter of free choice. If a couple love each other, and they have a commitment, and 
want to get married, they think that it is acceptable that they make love even before the 
actual marriage takes place, as a way to express their love for each other. Even this is 
thought in a context with no marriage purpose, due to the increase of couples living 
together nowadays, as if they were married but without being legally or religiously so. 
This might be said to be a matter of non-marital sex, instead of pre-marital, and it is one 
of the main things that church is having to deal with now, and that some people want it 
to accept: <Q> <R>. In this context cohabitation is seen like a trying period, to see if 
the couple is sexually compatible or not. <Q> <R>.

This might be seen as something not very mature, because supposedly, if someone is in 
love he or she knows that that is true. Anyway most people might be said to be afraid of 
showing their feelings, so it may be a way to express themselves, and also to see if they 
can live together (cohabitation is something that breaks up a lot of marriages as well). 
This should be considered as a valid reason for premarital sex, and even more so for 
people not believing in marriage, for whom this is not a matter of discussion at all.

Also pre-marital sex is acceptable only within certain limits: Consent (Rape is seen as 
totally unacceptable); age (paedophilia is despised in society generally; very large age 
gaps between partners are considered odd); availability (a sexual partner ought ideally 
to be single or "separated"); free (there is still a stigma attached to prostitution); stability 
(high levels of promiscuity and "bed-hopping" are frowned upon); safety (sex ought to 
be "safe" (barrier methods of contraception should be used) given the risk of disease and 
pregnancy); Meaning (it is best if sex is "meaningful" in the context of a relationship, 
unless it is a one-night-stand or infidelity, in which case it ought to be meaningless!) 
<R>.

Another point in favour of premarital sex is the fact that some people see sex as 
"experience", and this way it seems that it should be better to have as many different 
experiences in life as possible. Pre-marital sex with several different partners is said to 
be one of these experiences. Sex is "exciting" and is seen by some as an essential 
component of "a good weekend." <R>. The fact is that although 
nobody wants to admit it or talk about it, there are more and more cases of premarital 
sex every day <R>.

The ideas in the first paragraph seem to be just common sense, the fact that they are 
applied to premarital sex instead to non-marital sex or extra-marital sex might not be so 
important. They should be considered as the ideas that anybody should have in mind 
when having a sane sexual relationship. On the other hand, finding sex exciting or 
experience is something that is not so evident. Sex might be all those things, but also 
many more. It just depends on the person.

To sum up, there is a lot of controversy in the matter of pre-marital sex, but mainly the 
main argumentation is that it is a matter of free choice. If someone freely chooses being 
catholic then maybe he will stay to those principles, but someone agnostic or atheist 
may just want to explore inside him or herself to see what is better for him and his 
couple.


 



Should smoking be forbidden in bars and restaurants? Nowadays this is a much argued 
point and laws regulating these problems are spreading throughout the world: in Spain, 
for instance, New Year's Eve 2006 was the first day of prohibition, but in other 
countries, such as Ireland, Norway or some states of the United States, laws of a similar 
kind have been taking effect for several years. The objective of these laws is to achieve 
a smoke-free environment in pubs and restaurants to protect the health of those who 
work there. The Norwegian government also hopes to "de-normalise" smoking as a 
social pastime <R>. From non-smokers point of view smoking should be 
banned, because they are disturbed by it, but, on the other hand, smokers defend their 
right to smoke wherever and whenever they feel like it. Another point of view supports 
that there should be different areas for smokers and non-smokers, in order to avoid 
either of them disturbing the others. In this essay, I will point out the main opinions, and 
also why they seem acceptable to me or not.

One possible argument against smoking in public places is that non-smokers are also 
damaged by it, because they are breathing it when they are with smokers, and some 
people might also say that it is even worse for non-smokers than for smokers. 
Supporters of these laws say that they prevent passive smoking, encourage smokers to 
quit and prevent people taking up the habit <R>. In addition, there are 
people who do not like the smell that tobacco leaves in their clothes after they leave bars 
and restaurants where smoking is allowed. One of the most important benefits of these 
laws to a country can be gauged in billions of pounds, according to supporters, given the 
cost of treating smoking-related diseases like cancer and heart disease <R>.

From my point of view it is true that passive smokers will be benefited with the 
instalment of these laws across the world, because they will no longer have to suffer the 
inconvenience of having to breathe other people's smoke while they go to a bar or a 
restaurant. I would also agree with the sector that claims that smoking-related diseases 
are very expensive for public sanities, but I do not rely in a ban to stop people from 
smoking. I feel that people have to be motivated in order to stop smoking, and a law 
cannot really serve as a motivation, as long as it is just based on prohibition. Drugs have 
been banned for long, and it has never stopped drug-addicts in their habit. Nevertheless, 
I really expect it will discourage people from starting, or at least that it will delay the 
age in which they begin to smoke.

On the other hand, people who smoke think that if they feel like smoking why are they 
going to be forbidden to do that, and they also might think that they do not disturb 
anyone because they are not disturbed when someone smokes by their side. They claim 
that if non-smokers don't like to be around smoke, they should use their freedom of 
choice to not enter a building where the owner has decided to allow it, instead of 
denying everyone's freedom of choice by banning tobacco. Besides, there is evidence of 
the ban provoking quarrels, fights and even murders <R>. The 
ban is not always useful in what it intends, for instance smoking bans in public places 
leads to children being exposed to higher levels of tobacco smoke at home, a study by 
University College London shows. They have found that smokers were more likely to 
light up at home if prevented from doing so in cafes and bars, so the ban only displaces 
the problem without really solving it <R>.

As I see it, freedom of choice is very important for people and they should not be 
denied it. However, it seems difficult to mark the limits between one's freedom of 
choice and other's freedom; so, maybe the smoker's rights end where non-smoker's 
begin. Anyway I think that banning something just brings problems, so maybe it should 
be prohibited in some places, leaving others for people who enjoy smoking, and this 
would also make people more conscious of where they can smoke or not, not leaving 
them with a high anxiety level that they release at home damaging thus their children.

As a result of this most bar owners may think that they would easily go to bankrupt as 
soon as the ban is accepted, because most people smoke and if they do not go to bars 
there would be few people in, and bars would not do business at all, so most of them 
would have to close. According to the Ban Loss Database <R> lots of business had a lot of losses when the ban was applied in their areas and 
some even have to close down. But also some bar tenders might think that people would 
be more comfortable in their place if they didn't have to breathe so much smoke, and 
this is the reason why some small bars have become completely for non-smokers in 
Spain, after the ban took effect. Anyway they are a minority due to the fact that most 
bartenders think it would affect their business negatively, and almost 90% bars with a 
total surface area of less than 100 square metres have decided to let their customers 
continue smoking, said Jos� Luis Guerra, spokesman for the Spanish Hoteliers 
Federation <R>.

I agree with most bar owners about the fact that many people smoke socially, and that is 
usually done in bars, so, if people are not allowed to do so in some bars but are in 
others, they would probably go to those ones in which they are able to smoke without 
any problem. Besides, I am also of the opinion that if a group of people have some 
smokers in it they would probably go to some place where the smokers can also be 
comfortable, and that is why if only some bars prohibit tobacco they will have great 
losses.

It could also be said that it would be good for both smokers and non-smokers that bars 
could have two zones, one for smokers and one for non smokers, for none of them to 
disturb the others, and maybe some people would agree although it implies two 
problems: first, most people go out with people who smoke, so they would have to go to 
the smokers area and it would be the same for them; besides, that area will be 
overcrowded, while maybe the other one will remain half empty. Second, bar owners 
would say that they do not want to spend a large amount of money in repairing in their 
places, and without those changes the smoke would go from one zone to the other. So 
most bar tenders would not do that or if they do that would cost them a lot of money, so 
the prices would have to be increased in order for them to repay the reformations and 
people wouldn't want to pay more for things that are not that expensive.

I think that the ones who have the biggest problem in relation to the ban are bar and 
restaurant managers, because they will face the consequences more directly than 
individuals. Firstly because individuals may choose to go to a bar where smoking is 
allowed, and secondly due to the fact that, although most people think that having two 
separate zones is the best solution, that is a very expensive thing to put into practice. 
Customers want to have a better atmosphere but they also want the prices to remain the 
same. Meanwhile bar owners want to have their customers happy and to make the most 
profit out of their business. So, this seems to be a matter of different interests which are 
not compatible with each other. From my point of view the best solution might be that, 
as the government also has some interest in the ban, they should provide bars which 
want to have different areas habilitated with some kind of economical help, in order for 
them finding it easier.

For all these reasons, it seems to be a really difficult point, and it would not be easy 
saying just yes or no. It should be voted for, because then we would be able to know if it 
should or if it should not be banned. The main problem is that in most countries where 
the ban has been applied there has been no referendum to see what the majority of the 
population thinks of this issue, and this is something that should concern governments. 
In conclusion, there are almost as many people in one side than in the other, but it is 
also a political problem, and thus it should be solved politically without forgetting about 
the interests of the population.
