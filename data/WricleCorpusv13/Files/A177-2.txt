It may also serve to equip the person with what is neccesary to be a productive member of society. Through teaching and learning, people acquire and develop knowledge and skills. The term "education" is often used to refer to formal education: an education system. However, people do also receive informal education from a variety pf sources. Family, friends, the mass media, and so on. All these have a strong influence on the education of the people. Ultimately, all our experiences, serve as a way of education.This essay deals in particular with the Spanish Education System, which has been subjected of a strong social controversy in the past recent years. There exist different points of view about this topic, but the most important ones are those that concerne teachers, students and parents.

     Firstly,, teachers reclaim more authority and discipline in the classrooms, especially in primary and high schools. They want to be good teachers and to teach new generations of pupils. But for doing that, they need the methods, help from the parents and of course to have interaction with the students. Interaction is one of the most important factors in any teachers effectiveness, and teachers have noticed how in the past years it has been decerasind and des appearing. The goal of teaching is to establish a base of knowledge that allows the student to build up their knowledge as they are exposed to different life experiences. But if the receptor, in this case the student, is notprepare or do not want lo learn, then the teacher can not do his or her job. Another thing to have in mind, is that every day, teachers notice how parents, which are also a very important factor in the education system, do not give them enough support. So in general if the spanish teachers had to marked the education system, the result would be a 4 or a 5.

     Secondly, the students are also another important factor in the education system. In general, their opinion about how the education system is organized is not good. Although they want to have more free time, less exams, more holidays, etc, deep down they are conciouss about the low level of requirement they are asked for. If we compare our knowledge about any subject :literature, maths, chemistry or history, to what our parents used to learn, the difference is enormous. So, once again,the system , the government is doing something wrong.


    To end up, the majority of parents consider they are not part of the education system. They argue that the real education system is the one established between teacher - student.Eventhough, teachers are constantly demanding their help and trying to involucrate them in their childs education, they regreat of taking part. Moreover, there are sometimes in which parents give the reason to their children, so that means the authority of the teacher disappears. Of course there are also parents which are worried about their child education and agree with teachers thta the actual education system is not the best and the most effective.

     To conclude, nobody seem to be happy with the system. All the stakeholders consider that the education system in Spain has decreased in quality. "Parents, students and teachers should work toguether with the government in order to design better plans"; this is whta they have been demanding for the last years.
