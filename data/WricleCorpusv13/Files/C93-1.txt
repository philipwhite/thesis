
What are favelas and why are they brasilian?These are two impotant questions to answer before I start to talk about them.Favelas are squatter settlements named after the first settlements on the hill of  Moro de Favela.Its first inhabitants were poor rural emigrants going to the cities in search of work.Favelas are located at the steep hill sides encircling Rio de Janeiro.And ironically,most of them are situated on hillsides offering panoramic views over the city and the ocean, while the rich areas are located at the bottom of the hills.This may be their only opportunity to enjoy the cites to the ocean and its breeze.These hoods are known for their violence,diseases and the missing people.A lot has been written abuot its poor conditions of life starting from its insecure potable water,sanitation,and muders related with drug dealing.There is no garbage collection, street cleaning nor public lighting to the city.The governments aims is to invest a total of US$1 billion in its internationally acclaimed 'Favela-Bairro' neighbourhood improvement programme in which they will improve the main problems of these hoods in three phases.Some of these changes are going to improve their way of life but some of the solutions given by the government are not very welcome by the mass opinion neither by me.So,in this essay I would like to describe,argue and discuss the solutions given by the government and suggest possible solutions to these so called problems.
The first and the main problem in favelas is drugs.In these hoods there are different areas controlled by the most important drug dealers in Rio.In these zones you can buy all types of drugs sold by kids or adults.These areas are controled and protected by recluted soldiers of all ages.Sometimes rows take place and they end up in shooting.At this rate the police enter into the favela in caveirão, literally meaning "big skull", it is a military-style assault vehicle, with heavy armoury, a turret, and firing positions running along its body.<Q> <R>.I personally agree with Amnesty International that this is not a very good idea.Because in the process many pepole get killed including innocent people and children who haven't been able to get home in time.This is not a very useful measure for ending up with these rows.Despite this, I wouldn't recommend a police commando to enter in the favelas because they would probably end up dead,but this way there wouldn't de innocent deaths.
I think, another solution would be trying to arrest all the drug lords.As Meme Galinha says:<Q> But this may not help in many ways, because:<Q> <R>.In this case if we all put them under arrest, who will provide proteccion to the community?On the other hand they are only giving a solution to the problems they help to create.Like for example, if there was no drug traffic, the police wouldn't always be watching and waiting for something to happen.And in the same way if there were no shootings or other different type of crimes, may be caveirão also wouldn't exist.Yet,this is an utopic world which only exists in my good-hearted mind.The real world needs real solutions to real problems.In spite of being an utopic solution, drug lords power extend to the means that you need their permission to do anything.They control the whole favela,you can't even enter nor leave without their permission.But at least I have given one,even if it is utopic.Some people wouldn't even think in a solution, they would just sit back and relax, forgeting that there are people dying at the moment.
Furthermore,the government has also thought in providing full property rights to the residents.Giving them property titles.If not,as Robert Neuwirth says, <Q> <R>. Property Rights in Favelas).I believe that the people who buy these possession rights are the drug dealers.Because I don't think that any one else in a favela would be able to buy a possession right if he or she were not a drug dealer.Despite, <Q> <R>I may say that these people live worse than the Medieval Ages.At least in those days the peasants could recieve their mail containig good or bad news from their relatives.<Q> <R>. Personally speaking, this is not fair.Everyone deserves a roof upon their heads, even if the roof is in a squattercity.But I also recognize that the government can't let people live within th limits of illegality, but this doesn't mean that they have the right to evict families from the only place they have to live.And all this just because there is a wealthy person with enough money to pay for it.
Other solutions provided by the government come by the hand of a studied programme divided in three phases <Q>. I believe that this is a very helpful solution to the poor conditions in which many brasilians are forced to live.But they might have to remove some houses to build the roads,the ditches,and so on.Where are these families going to stay?After buiilding the roads are they going to build for them new houses?And of course, if I were living in a favela and I see that the government has built a better and safer house to my neighbour, I'd also want one.All these questions have not been answerd by the Mayor,but I'm sure that people who know about this programme have asked themselves these questions and maybe many more.We are talking about human lives and before closing the case we have to answer all the possible questions that may occur.After improving the favelas sanitation,someone will have to pay for the 
mantainment.So at the end the poor inhabitants who don't have enough to live, will have to pay for the electricity, the garbage collection and the street cleaning in the same way as the other estates do by paying some kind of taxes within the community.But even if someone had to pay taxes the health will improve and the diseases in the favelas will decrease.                                                                                   The contribution of this idea brings up another problem.Who will want to work in the favelas?I don't think that everyone would like to work in such conditions and in such an insecure place as Rocinha (one of the most biggest flavelas in Rio)can be.You'll have to be careful with the area you are working in, the drug dealers with who you'll have to meet every day.You would always go to work asking yourself if today will be the day that you'll die.But there is a very easy solution to that problem.Many inhabitants will need good jobs with high salaries.<Q> <R> who take advantage of their desperate situation and offer them low salaries for a full time job.This may help to rise the economy of the favelas in a long period of time.
To conclude,I would like to remark that in this essay I have presented the problems that take place in brasilian favelas and argued about some of the poosible alternative solutions such as:drugs, police brutality, and sanitation as the main problems while living in a favela.I would like to invite you readers to think about this situation every time you may feel that the world is against you or your life stinks.Think about these hundreds of inhabitants who don't know any other way of life and even though, they still smile and look forward to another sunrise.
