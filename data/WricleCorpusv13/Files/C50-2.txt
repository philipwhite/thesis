   Throughout history, sexual intercourse has been considered as a sing of couple's love.   This action  has been changed through the passing of time with the liberty of women   to choose their life, or the sense of morality that men and women have received in those   years about sex; that is to say, religious, social and culture issues are affected in   people's way of living because of that. This is why, giving sexuality education in   Schools has become in one of the best alternative to change wrong ideas about sex or   prevent diseases.  In this paper, I intend to discuss some different points of view that   parents or Institutions have in mind about sex education in Schools.       Some people argue that the sexual education in Schools helps young people to reduce   the risks of negative consequences which are produced by wrong information related to   sex.  In the first place, sexuality education teaches students how to protect themselves   against exploitation, abuse or unintended pregnancies. Secondly, it has been suggested   that an effective sex and relationship education tends someone to have more opened   mind, that is to say, it makes young people's skills to develop in negotiation, listening   others and decision making because they are feeling more confident in their life. For   that reason, it is generally accepted that people who should give these classes have to   be experts on those subjects.        In addition, there is an illustration of that fact which  is made by a representative from   SIECUS, The Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, who   affirms that correct sexuality Education Program at School should have these main   goals, as follows: to provide an understanding information about human sexuality   which gives an opportunity for young people to develop and understand their values   and beliefs, to help them in order to exercise responsibility regarding sexual   relationship and develop these interpersonal skills. What this means, students need to   have information on all the following topics: sexual development, reproduction,   relationship and contraception. It is seemed that there is no necessity for students to be   taught those subjects by teachers, because another professional experts should do it, for   example the local adolescent health nurse who will be able to import it and explain   some examples she could observe by herself. In the same way, some of the researches   say that in Spain most of adult people are agreed with the idea of having sexual health   improves widely, boys and girls lost their shyness when they try to ask their teachers   about a sexual doubt.       One of the main arguments in favour of the sex education in School is that people,  who ought to give these classes, should have a comprehensible version to explain the  differences between the female and male sexual organs, give lots of examples about  Sexual Transmitted Disease and what the meaning of that is, and prevent  the  development of teenager pregnancies or porn on the Internet, because it is reasonable  argue that sexual education does not only belong to biological vision of life but the way  of knowing their own body in all aspects, solutions to eradicate a possible sexual illness,  or giving the act of sex not only in human being but also in animals, so as to understand  how living being are united to create new species.       On the other hand, some people point out that sex education programs at school are   too explicit. Because it can increase the sexuality curiosity that lead to have sexual  experimentation in promiscuous ages. One possible argument is that information about  sex should be taught at home at young age because parents are the only ones who can  impart their own values to their children. In those cases, parents will be educated on  how to explain children these items, to put it in another way, it could be interpreted as  parents or tutors should be the ones who receive sexual education because they possess  enough maturity and responsibility how to distinguish an impulse than reason, an  action they interpret it could be occurred  in boys and girls and they only would need to  find out the  Another people suggested that the best way to know sex is the common  sense rather than having sexual classes at School or talking about it with their parents.       One of the most strong opinion against sexual education is done by Catholic Church.   It is argued that most of Catholic people tends to obey the rules of the religion. These   ones affirm that, sex is a subject that husband should teach his wife related to the   unknown world of sexuality she is not unaware of . More specifically, that opinion is   combined with social issues in which men are able to know all about sex and women   should wait for meeting her ideal couple to give her body to him and lose her virginity   in order to demonstrate they are not committed a sin if they are tented to do it before   the sacrament or marriage.       These arguments seem to make sense because it is said that most Catholic or non-  Catholic parents prefers teaching their children to improve the way of living and  practise their self control so as to be better person instead of libidinous ones. For that  reason, parents will take care of telling sex to their siblings in a way they should think  the best formula is done in due course. This seems a logical argument because they can  choose the right time to give them sex classes as their own point of view and be totally  qualified  if they ask them about the significance of making love is and the possible  consequence that is the creation of life between the union of man and woman, the  decision not to be pregnant thought abortion or day after pills, and so on.        There are other views related to this kind of education, which depends on the   choices of School or High School impose. Some researches such as Denise Witmer,   from Guide to Parenting of Adolescents, say that there two different types of sex   education classes in the United States that depending on where the young people live,   adolescents will either be studying one of these: The Comprehensive Sexuality   Education, that is a program which starts in Kindergarten and goes through High   School. It allows the students acquire a broad acknowledgement of sex education, for   instance safe sex, sexual transmitted diseases, what the meaning of taboo words is,   masturbation and contraception methods. On the other hand, that program: The   Abstinence only until Marriage emphasize total abstinence from sexual behaviour and   it does not cover information about the items that comprehensive sexuality Education   does.        It is possible to argue that parents would have the opportunity to let the education of  their children in School or do it by themselves when they become teenagers. The  Catholic people support the idea of abstinence because they tend to think the couple  would give themselves up to the act of love with pleasure by God's look. In that way,  their children are allowed by their parents to know more about sex with the intention of  waiting for it to marriage. In addition, there is the point that some people are argued  with the education system at School under the cautious and attentive look from parents.  In other words, siblings are allowed to have those classes as long as their progenitors or  tutors choose what students need to know about it.        To sum up, we have seen the different and controversial points of view related to the   possibility to give sex education in School to young students whose parents allows it  . There are lots of commentaries about that item. We also point out the one main   opinion in favour could be the approval that children should know their all body by   themselves, physically and mentally, either. The argument explains this is the best start   to affront life, they will be more confident in common situations in the future, and there   is no other way rather than learning all these actions at School, because it is said there   are professional experts who will be able to explain the whole meaning of sex in the   correct way. The another one against this measure is done by most of Catholic and   conservative people who would rather learning all these knowledge about sex at home   than having classes at School. They tend to argue that they would feel more qualified   talking about sex if they are the only ones who can explain it by detail and would have   the election to choice the appropriated moment for telling their children in order not to   increase their sexual desire. It could be argued a mid point on that item it could be the   way of teaching sexuality at School with the condition that parents approve the subjects   their siblings are going to take part of. Considering all these points it might be   reasonable to find out the best manner to prevent bad consequences not to have a sexual   education at home or School, either.
