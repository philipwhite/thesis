
Nowadays in Spain, the issue of the private copy canon  has been passionately attacked  and furiously defended by the different collectives affected. The private copy canon is a tax applied to different recording means and whose collection is received by authors, editors, productors and artists in compensation for the copies made out of their work. It was registered for the first time in the Spanish legislation in the 22/1987 Law of Intelectual Property, November 11. It also appears in the 25th article of the rewrited text of the Spanish Intelectual Property Law (Royal Legislative Decree 1/1996, April 12) the compensatory pretension resulting of an alleged affectation of the authors, editors, artists and audiovisual and phonographic patrimonial right, when a purchaser makes copies for private use. The law obliges to do the charge throught the collective gestion entities (SGAE, AIE and AGEDI). Because of that, it is so-called a <Q> . The private copy canon is charged in Spain to the equipment, devices and material manufacturers and importers able to record musical or audiovisual plays. However, the SGAE points that the Intelectual Property Law considers that if in the bill of the distributor, wholesaler or the different retail traders, the canon is not showed explicitly, they will be charged with the canon directly. In 2003 September, the canon begun to be applied to virgin CDs and DVDs as a result of an agreement between the author rights gestion entitites (leaded by the SGAE) and ASIMELEC. <R> . In this essay I will explain why, in my view, the private copy canon is not only a bad idea as concept, but also is being executed in a wrong way.

The first flaw I see, lies in the way the canon has been developed and managed throught the time.When the canon was modified for the first time since 1996, in 2003 each year was modified again to add new possible copy supports or devices able to copy, in 2003 it was the CDs and DVDs, in 2004 the scanners, photocopiers and printers, in 2005 USB memories, external hard disks and memory cards like flash or USB, in 2006 digital cameras both for pictures and for video and 3G mobiles. Now their next target its to charge the very ADSL lines and the WiFi cards and aerials in 2007. In my view this last pretension is almost illegal while the other are basically unfair. A group of private organizations cant try to apply something near a tax, especially taking into account that the agreement between the author rights gestion entitites (leaded by the SGAE) and ASIMELEC was sealed without asking neither the legal authorities nor the consumers associations, just between them. Also this fact is nearly illegal in my opinion. The supports they actually charge from the CDs to the printers or cameras of any kind have an incredible amount of uses absolutely not related to the infringement of copyright, for example if you want to buy a digital camera to record the baptism of your nephew you will pay the canon, and if you want to copy that recrd into a virgin CD you will pay the canon again, however you have not recorded any copyrighted material in any of the supports, I think that this is clearly unfair. Not to talk about the ADSL, we are in the Internet era and they try to charge the very ADSL lines! However this gestion associations claim that their biggest loses come from the download of copyrighted materials from the internet, especially p2p programs (person to person, a kind of software that enables anyone look up for any kind of archive hosted in another pc user of that program and donwload it). They think again, that every record downloaded that way, is a sale lost. And as all that supports could be used to violate their copyrights applying a canon as a preventive metod to alleviate the loses this supports are causing to them.On the other hand we have to consider the statistics, by each record the author percieves 0.83 euros, to percieve, with their own sales, the equivalent amount of money the SGAE (authors) try to percieve by the audio canon (16.512.035 euros) they would need to grow the sales in 19.907.314 recods, that would represent a 30.5 % rise in the sales. In May 2003 the loses in concept of piracy were the 21.3% so a estimation of the units sold in the pirate market gives us the number of 13.905.900 records (the 21.3% of 65.3 million of records sold in 2002), that means an amount not collected of 11.536.676 euros, a sum noticeably inferior to the amount they want to percieve through the CD canon. This means that with the canon they will not only be compensated for piracy loses but that they will have an aditional benefit of 4.975.359 euros. <R>  Also in the management of the money collected by the canon the share that each author percieves is not the same, it is decided arbitrately by the gestion associations, giien more or less money to each author depending on the sales of thier work. However the lists of the most sold legally is not the same as the list of the most sold illegally or downloaded, showing again that is indeed an unfair measure, not only for the consumers, but also for the authors.

In my view, the second flaw in the concept of this canon is the double burden imposed to the purchaser of the different supports and the try to be equivalent the private copy to the massive piracy when they are completely different, the first is legal, the second is not.When a person wants to copy one of their original musical or audiovisual works (specially th musical are the most polemic) they find that original copy, has an anticopy system, so make a private copy is difficult for the most of the people (without computer knowledge), however they have indeed bought a support, where they want to copy the contents for one reason or another (for example if the dont want to carry their cds while travelling, they could be lost or damaged, or if they just want to have a copy in house and another in their work ect.) and by buying that support they have already paid the canon, so the double burden is that having paid a canon that gives them the right to make a private copy, they have to struggle to be able to do that copy avoiding the anticopy system (adding that by Law copy a work with anticopy system is a crime, though private copy is legal, paradoxically). However the Intelectual Rights associations (begining with the SGAE) claim that the private copy make by normal people is minimum, that the true people that copy their work are the piracy mafias, organizations that massively copy this work and sell it illegaly in the street (like the recently famous "top manta"- people illegaly selling copied cds and dvds with intelectual protected work inside). They also think that each illegal copy bought is a legal original not being sold with the damage that entails.But in my opinion this is not only false but also an excuse to apply the canon abusively. In first case it's absurd to think that every person that buys a illegal copied cd or dvd, with an approximated cost between 3 to 6 euros, would buy the same work original when it would cost them about 20 or 30 euros, this is common sense, not every body can afford that, and even less taking into account that in the best situation by this parameters they can buy 3 illegaly copied works (18 euros in total by the higher price) instead one single copy of an original legal work of 20 euros (by the lower price). And secondly the canon is paid by any purchaser indiscriminately , that means that no only people that wants a copy of their original or mafias are affected by the canon, also the educational system, the health system and every single person or institution that uses supports that can contain copied works in their work, or any other activities. This is obviously unfair, and is not only that, but also we have to keep in mind that in the public institutions (as in a lot of areas of our lives) this kind of support are widely extended and by applying the canon this way, directly, enormous amounts of money that should be used to better our dairy lives will be used to pay the canon. They don't want to think that no every support able to contain copied work would be used in that way, but the canon is applied without exception. Finally a tribunal sentence has given the reason to a purchaser, Eduardo Serrano, 55, an architect from Mï¿½laga has won a trial against the shop where he bought his virgin cds in July 2005. He reclaimed to be given back to him the price of the canon that compensate the authors for the private copy. He even argumented that a cd would be used to contain the record of that very trial without the infringement of the copyright of any author or work. <R> 

So to conclude, I have explained how the canon was approved in an unilateral way, how it affects lots of supports able to do much more than just copy protected material indiscriminately, what their abussive pretensions are in the internet area, how this canon is applied accumulatively by several puchases of charged supports, that the society's organizations like health, education and any other is forced to destinate founds to pay the canon when they would have better uses, and recently the tibunals are giving the reasons to the citizens that complain about the canon. In my opinion the aplication of the canon has generated the collective thought that if they force us to pay an unfair canon, we are legitimated to do any number of illegal copies we want, as a retribution, however who really suffers for this attitude, both the canon imposition  and its consequences in the mind of the people, are the authors that want to make a living out of music, because they love the music. 
 







   Throughout history, sexual intercourse has been considered as a sing of couple's love.   This action  has been changed through the passing of time with the liberty of women   to choose their life, or the sense of morality that men and women have received in those   years about sex; that is to say, religious, social and culture issues are affected in   people's way of living because of that. This is why, giving sexuality education in   Schools has become in one of the best alternative to change wrong ideas about sex or   prevent diseases.  In this paper, I intend to discuss some different points of view that   parents or Institutions have in mind about sex education in Schools.       Some people argue that the sexual education in Schools helps young people to reduce   the risks of negative consequences which are produced by wrong information related to   sex.  In the first place, sexuality education teaches students how to protect themselves   against exploitation, abuse or unintended pregnancies. Secondly, it has been suggested   that an effective sex and relationship education tends someone to have more opened   mind, that is to say, it makes young people's skills to develop in negotiation, listening   others and decision making because they are feeling more confident in their life. For   that reason, it is generally accepted that people who should give these classes have to   be experts on those subjects.        In addition, there is an illustration of that fact which  is made by a representative from   SIECUS, The Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, who   affirms that correct sexuality Education Program at School should have these main   goals, as follows: to provide an understanding information about human sexuality   which gives an opportunity for young people to develop and understand their values   and beliefs, to help them in order to exercise responsibility regarding sexual   relationship and develop these interpersonal skills. What this means, students need to   have information on all the following topics: sexual development, reproduction,   relationship and contraception. It is seemed that there is no necessity for students to be   taught those subjects by teachers, because another professional experts should do it, for   example the local adolescent health nurse who will be able to import it and explain   some examples she could observe by herself. In the same way, some of the researches   say that in Spain most of adult people are agreed with the idea of having sexual health   improves widely, boys and girls lost their shyness when they try to ask their teachers   about a sexual doubt.       One of the main arguments in favour of the sex education in School is that people,  who ought to give these classes, should have a comprehensible version to explain the  differences between the female and male sexual organs, give lots of examples about  Sexual Transmitted Disease and what the meaning of that is, and prevent  the  development of teenager pregnancies or porn on the Internet, because it is reasonable  argue that sexual education does not only belong to biological vision of life but the way  of knowing their own body in all aspects, solutions to eradicate a possible sexual illness,  or giving the act of sex not only in human being but also in animals, so as to understand  how living being are united to create new species.       On the other hand, some people point out that sex education programs at school are   too explicit. Because it can increase the sexuality curiosity that lead to have sexual  experimentation in promiscuous ages. One possible argument is that information about  sex should be taught at home at young age because parents are the only ones who can  impart their own values to their children. In those cases, parents will be educated on  how to explain children these items, to put it in another way, it could be interpreted as  parents or tutors should be the ones who receive sexual education because they possess  enough maturity and responsibility how to distinguish an impulse than reason, an  action they interpret it could be occurred  in boys and girls and they only would need to  find out the  Another people suggested that the best way to know sex is the common  sense rather than having sexual classes at School or talking about it with their parents.       One of the most strong opinion against sexual education is done by Catholic Church.   It is argued that most of Catholic people tends to obey the rules of the religion. These   ones affirm that, sex is a subject that husband should teach his wife related to the   unknown world of sexuality she is not unaware of . More specifically, that opinion is   combined with social issues in which men are able to know all about sex and women   should wait for meeting her ideal couple to give her body to him and lose her virginity   in order to demonstrate they are not committed a sin if they are tented to do it before   the sacrament or marriage.       These arguments seem to make sense because it is said that most Catholic or non-  Catholic parents prefers teaching their children to improve the way of living and  practise their self control so as to be better person instead of libidinous ones. For that  reason, parents will take care of telling sex to their siblings in a way they should think  the best formula is done in due course. This seems a logical argument because they can  choose the right time to give them sex classes as their own point of view and be totally  qualified  if they ask them about the significance of making love is and the possible  consequence that is the creation of life between the union of man and woman, the  decision not to be pregnant thought abortion or day after pills, and so on.        There are other views related to this kind of education, which depends on the   choices of School or High School impose. Some researches such as Denise Witmer,   from Guide to Parenting of Adolescents, say that there two different types of sex   education classes in the United States that depending on where the young people live,   adolescents will either be studying one of these: The Comprehensive Sexuality   Education, that is a program which starts in Kindergarten and goes through High   School. It allows the students acquire a broad acknowledgement of sex education, for   instance safe sex, sexual transmitted diseases, what the meaning of taboo words is,   masturbation and contraception methods. On the other hand, that program: The   Abstinence only until Marriage emphasize total abstinence from sexual behaviour and   it does not cover information about the items that comprehensive sexuality Education   does.        It is possible to argue that parents would have the opportunity to let the education of  their children in School or do it by themselves when they become teenagers. The  Catholic people support the idea of abstinence because they tend to think the couple  would give themselves up to the act of love with pleasure by God's look. In that way,  their children are allowed by their parents to know more about sex with the intention of  waiting for it to marriage. In addition, there is the point that some people are argued  with the education system at School under the cautious and attentive look from parents.  In other words, siblings are allowed to have those classes as long as their progenitors or  tutors choose what students need to know about it.        To sum up, we have seen the different and controversial points of view related to the   possibility to give sex education in School to young students whose parents allows it  . There are lots of commentaries about that item. We also point out the one main   opinion in favour could be the approval that children should know their all body by   themselves, physically and mentally, either. The argument explains this is the best start   to affront life, they will be more confident in common situations in the future, and there   is no other way rather than learning all these actions at School, because it is said there   are professional experts who will be able to explain the whole meaning of sex in the   correct way. The another one against this measure is done by most of Catholic and   conservative people who would rather learning all these knowledge about sex at home   than having classes at School. They tend to argue that they would feel more qualified   talking about sex if they are the only ones who can explain it by detail and would have   the election to choice the appropriated moment for telling their children in order not to   increase their sexual desire. It could be argued a mid point on that item it could be the   way of teaching sexuality at School with the condition that parents approve the subjects   their siblings are going to take part of. Considering all these points it might be   reasonable to find out the best manner to prevent bad consequences not to have a sexual   education at home or School, either.
