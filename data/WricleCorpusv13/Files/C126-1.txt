The reason for this is that the current monopoly laws in Spain -and most Europe- don't prosecute CEOS even for clear violations of either monopoly or competence laws; I judge this as a legal flaw that affects negatively many CEOS' motivation to do their job in an ethic way.

As a first word, I should make clear what the main purpose of an enterprise is; to do so, I will shortly explain the main established theories of the firm; they deal with the relationship between managers and "shareholders" (broadly speaking, investors): first of all, the neoclassical theory states that the only goal of a firm is the maximization of the social benefit coming from its production, which is controlled efficiently by a "selfless" (meaning "not selfish") manager; nevertheless, the problem with this theory is that it does not analyse whether this manager is really selfless in practice; the second theory is called "the agency theory ", and tries to solve the above mentioned question: it considers that a firm is an agreement between principals and their managers, who are normal individuals with the same usual feelings, desires and emotions that every other person has; in technical words, they also have their own "utility function curves", and some of their curve's functions can consist on such worldly things as leisure time, money, lovers, cars, power, etc. The problem here is easily understood if we consider that the agent does not necessarily share its principal's utility curve (desires), so he will not work properly, unless the principal has enough power to monitor and punish him. Therefore, the principal will take care to state the terms he needs when signing a contract with the agent, or will ask for a consequent lowering in the agent's payment or reward.

Moreover, if we continue considering the implications of these theories, we will notice that these two actors are not the only ones affected by the firm's activities: we will also find that consumers, ordinary employees, and many other people are also affected by their activities; these non-deciding actors in the firm's activities are called "stakeholders". The technical word for this influence by an -"active"- economic actor on other -"passive"- actor's utility curve is "externality", because the modifications on these "passive" actor's utility functions are external to the functions of the active one; this did not happen when the active one "disturbed" its principal's utility curve, for we know that the principal will take immediate legal actions against its agent, as it is stated in their contract, and this will mean an "internal" consequence for the agent (a change in his utility function). Finally, the process by which an economic actor "A" "punishes" another actor "B" for an unsolicited, negative change in A's utility curve produced by B's activities (or negligence), is called "internalization"; this process helps the society by forcing economic actors to take into consideration the effect that their actions have on other ones; in example, a firm that consciously throws toxic waste into a river will care about the effect they may have on the people living nearby, if and only if this firm can have its profits reduced because of that throwing; in example, because of a legal sanction.

From a legal standpoint, there has been a considerable improvement (in the last 120 years) in the legal methods used to force big firms to internalise the undesired results of their actions. To make this possible, entire branches of the law have been created on that purpose, as monopoly law, antitrust law, competence law, environmental law, etc. Also, from much earlier times there have been legal remedies destined to regulate contract enforcement and breach of contract; the difference has always been whether the legislation and courts have been efficient or inefficient in achieving this goal.

But from the historic point of view, the development of this internalization tools for the welfare of society against individuals who use economic power selfishly has not been an easy one. Apart from the publicly founded Spanish and Portuguese colonial enterprises, one of the first companies to be subject to a serious surveillance of its activities and accountancy was the British Company of the Eastern Indies: in the first place, after the Glorious Revolution in 1688, the Dutch nobility and the King himself were among the shareholders, and this guaranteed the thoroughness of this monitoring; afterwards, when the Company established itself in India by a mandate of the Crown, the greater distance and the sheer magnitude of the tasks to which it was destined made this accountability less firm, and problems arose; finally, an Act ended the Company's dominion in India and established a new body of managers to take care of the Indian territories under the British Crown. A more recent example would be the success of the American Monopoly and Antitrust Law, which investigated Rockefeller's business and ended splitting them after a long, difficult legal process. Later in the seventies, two CEOS of two big airlines went to jail for being declared guilty of conspiring to <Q>. Nowadays, there have been several attempts to finish with Bill Gates' position in the software industry: for right or wrong, they have finished with the almost complete defeat of the general prosecutor of the United States, and even of its former president, Bill Clinton. Finally, there has been a clear example of a violation of the criminal and commerce legislation regarding the U.S. Stock Exchange: the Enron Scandal, which affected dozens of thousands of shareholders and employees through all the United States; in this case, the persons found responsible for it fortunately ended (an still remain) in jail. The lesson here is that if you commit a serious violation of monopoly law in the United States and you get caught with it, you may end in jail; but, what about Europe?

In today's Europe, the main instance at regional (European Union) level for violations of the monopoly law is the European Commission; this organism has the faculty of determining whether a company has violated the European Competence Law, and of imposing sanctions on it; unfortunately, tough this organism makes quite a good job, its sanctions have as their object altering the utility functions of these companies, and not those of their directives. The meaning of this is that their directives have been exempted "de facto" of all personal responsibility coning from their companies' violations of monopoly law. The consequence is that, in practice, it does not matter how big or strong a sanction against a company is, because in several economic fields (such as telecommunications, water supply, transportation, etc) the actual market structure is that of an oligopoly; an oligopoly is a situation in which several companies have almost 100% shares of a market, so they dominate it, and also have the power to dictate either the prices or the quantity of a given service or product. Therefore, every time the Commission is going to sanction some companies for colliding (making illegal agreements on price fixing) in some market (in example, in the telecommunications market), the sanctions are not going to alter that market's structure in any decisive way.

A proof of the reality of this phenomenon is that more and more scandals arise, and are then replaced by others; it is not surprising, then, that more and more sanctioning processes are started both in Europe and in the U.S. by the judicial bodies dedicated to enforce the law in these fields. As an example, the Spanish Commission for the Telecommunications Market has recently threatened to sanction Movistar, Orange and Vodafone -the three biggest Spanish companies in the telecommunications market by their share- on the grounds that they agreed to fix their prices; the process started the 15th of October, and the sanction could be as strong as 10% of their revenues. Moreover, this problem is a commonplace situation throughout Europe: in France, the French Competence Council sanctioned France Telecom, Bouygues Telecom and SFR on almost identical grounds. On a very similar topic, Telefonica was sanctioned some years ago for using its privileged position as the biggest owner of telephone networks to avoid price competence by the other internet service providers (ISP) in Spain; we may find endless examples: most companies dominating a strategic market, in a potentially monopolistic or oligopolistic environment don't find a big problem to squeeze their customer's benefits.

The implications of this scenario are clear: the companies' prospects are not decisively affected by sanctions, after the impact caused by the sanctions has passed; even worse, we should also take into account the weakening of these sanctions caused by the right of appeal given to the enterprises, by the real possibility of the enterprises not being caught, and by the fact that not 100% of the violations can be detected. So in the end, violating monopoly and competence law in a reiterated way is profitable for these companies, as they are not dramatically affected by the sanctions imposed on them.

There is a final question to reflect on: whether it would be feasible to affect the enterprises' utility curve in a more subtle way, to make them internalize the social loss they generate with their illegal operations. In fact, I consider that the use of personal sanctions, based on both civil and criminal responsibility, against these companies' directives and CEOS would be much more effective; the reason for this being, first, that these persons are the ones deciding to carry out of these operations; and, second, that this CEOS' personal interests are the decisive factor for presenting these operations as financially profitable to their companies and their shareholders; so it is clear that affecting these CEOS' own utility curves would make these operations substantially less profitable for everyone, and would, understandably, reduce them to the socially most convenient magnitude.
