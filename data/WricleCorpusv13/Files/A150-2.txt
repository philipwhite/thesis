Nowadays,inside the Spanish education system there are many problems.However,this essay will only deal with religion,violence among classmates and violence towards the teacher,these since they are the most common nowadays.According to recent surveys,one out of ten students are bullied,many are discriminated because of their beliefs and teachers suffer more stress.In this essay I will try to discuss some of the viewpoints about these controversial facts.


One of the problems of the Spanish education system is religion.On the one hand,there are people who want to eliminate religion from the course curriculums because they find it useless and discriminatory towards other beliefs since there are people who come of other countries ,each one with differents beliefs,and have to study a religion in which they don't believe.This is the case of the Spanish goverment,who supports the idea that religion should be studied out of schools.Inside of this attitude,some people think that in this subject is all a lie therefore their children are learning anything false and later this can confuse them. On the contrary,there are people,included church, who think that religion is an important part of our lives and it should be studied compulsory with moral purposes.Finally,some people might argue that religion should be optional depending on personal beliefs and convictions.This seems a logical argument since there isn't obligation for people who believe or people who don't believe.With this measure would be respected each attitude.


Another problem is violence among classmates.This is a problem which has drastically increased during the last few years.Many children are bullied everyday in our schools with horrible consequences such as psychological,and behavior disorders and even suicides.The reasons of these aggressions are very varied,for example,the looks,weak personality and so on.Moreover,while a child is being hit ,there are classmates recording this fact and then sell it.Many children who have suffered this,don't want to go at school for fear and most of them don't want study more,they prefer work in spite of being very young.Some people think that these are normal kids quarrellings although the most of the families and teaches are against it and think some measures must be taken.This seems a logical argument because an aggression could never be justificated for being normal kids quarrelings since it isn't a play,this is violence which can end up in a terrible fact.


A final problem is violence towards teachers.They might suffer the same or even stronger consequences of bullied children,that is,psychological disorders,traumas,physical aggressions and so on.Yesterday,the newspaper published that a teacher was hit and insulted for a pupil for saying that he couldn't smoke in class.This is a particulary case, but there are much more which have ended worse.It has been shown that the number of vocational teachers is diminishing due to these facts.Thus,motivation and encouraging learning is starting to fail.Some people would argue that in many cases the pupil is provoked by the teacher but it doesn't justify an aggression.


To sum up,the recent events in the Spanish educational system have generated a lot of discussions and counter points of view concerning religion,bullying and violence towards teachers.It seems clear that measures must be taken soon or our educational system will have serious problems.
