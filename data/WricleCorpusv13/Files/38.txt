
   Prostitution has been present from the very beginning of human history in most societies up to the present dates. As the world has evolved, people who exercises prostitution has found new ways of procuring clients (TV, the internet, newspapers, etcetera). However, even though the form might have changed throughout the centuries, its content has really not: prostitution is, as stated in the New OXFORD Dictionary of English, <Q>. Despite this, legality regarding this profession has had different approaches in every culture, time and country. Now that the debate is in an impasse in Spain, whose comfortable politicians allow prostitution to be in an uncomfortable position of legal uncertainty, I feel compelled to write this essay in order to set out my conviction that said profession should be legalized and the pointless controversy about it gotten over with for everybody's sake.
   Before we go any further, I must define what kind of prostitution I am defending. White slavery has thousands of victims every year, and it is considered the XXI century bondage. As long as our essay is concerned, it consists in luring or compelling people (mostly women) into a certain county with expectations of a better future and are then forced to become prostitutes under threat either on the street or locked up in brothels. Within some countries, moreover, there sadly exists trafficking of human beings by law, in many of its perverse forms: parents having the right of selling their daughters to older men for marriage, minors being sold to brothels, etcetera. Also, dire destitution compels a big number of people to become prostitutes. Perhaps one of the most devastating testimonies of this is the picture of an eleven-year-old pregnant girl, Mary Simpson, a prostitute in Victorian England. Unfortunately, this still happens in many countries in the world. In short, all these are foul ways of prostitution to me, and I believe that most people, at least in the Eastern society, will agree with this. Therefore, the kind of prostitution I intend to defend is that in which a single or several adults (although the age that makes you an adult might be yet another tricky issue I do not want to get into) decide to engage in sexual / escort activities that do not affect any third person with one or more adults for an economical retribution (otherwise we would not be talking about prostitution, would we?).
   Thus said, I am going to pose a quite obvious question: Why does prostitution exist? The also obvious answer in my opinion is that it exists because of people's sexual needs. Architects and bricklayers would not exist if people did not have housing needs, doctors would not exist either if people did not have health problems and neither would stockbreeders and farmers if people did not have any need to eat at all. Some might say that it is not the same thing, for people cannot live without food but they can live without sex. That is actually true, due to the fact that many religious people in the world such as priests and nuns lead an apparently happy life without having any sex at all (that we know of). And yet, we probably would not need paintings or motion pictures to keep ourselves alive either and yet we have museums and movie theaters all over the world, which are, I assume, legalized in every country in the world. So what makes a museum different from a brothel in terms of meeting people's need of "entertainment"? 
   Morality does. The expansion of certain religions throughout history until the present age such as Catholicism or Islamism has been, in my opinion, very helpful to the demonizing and punishing sex, and so to make different societies in the world see it as something awful or something right only within certain bonds, like marriage.  Nietzsche once wrote that <Q>.  My point is that there is nothing wrong with sex at all, and, even though people have every right to believe there is, they have no right to interfere with the law with arguments that have no empiric or logical basis whatsoever.
   From here we come to the whole hypocrisy of all of this: some people believe that, if prostitution is kept outlawed, it will subsequently curb. What I think they really mean is that, by keeping it banned, their appalling fa�ade will remain "untainted". For instance, a very conservative Spanish journalist, Pedro J. Ram�rez, who has never defended the legalization of prostitution but rather otherwise, was actually caught some ten years ago having sex with a prostitute, performing several non-conservative practices involving straps and urine in a controversial video which, apart from being an obvious violation of his right to privacy, did put his bigotry into question. They seem to want prostitution in the shadows, which is where Spanish regulations regarding it are, due to the lack of a sensible debate and, probably, fear of being frowned upon in the political sphere and by the public opinion.
   Nevertheless, the most important argument to me in favor of the total legalization of prostitution is the safety and welfare of the people who practice this profession. In the Netherlands, prostitutes enjoy the same rights (and suffer the same obligations, like paying taxes) as any other kind of worker. This makes it safer because, in those circumstances, prostitutes are more protected by the authority and unions in case of abuse, and they are also more likely to practice their profession indoors if they want, which means getting rid of the uncertainty that practicing it outdoors entails (call girls, for instance) and enjoying the closed-circuit security that rooms in the Netherlands provide. Very well, one might say, but that does not really end with illegal prostitution, for there will be prostitutes who will be down for some undeclared income and who therefore will be back on the streets and out of the law. I could not agree more. As a matter of fact, some prostitutes do not want their profession to be legalized because they feel that they make more money in the sexual black market. Furthermore, if we look around, there are people on the street selling burned CDs and DVDs even though they have been legal for quite a while. But my question is, if DVD movies were illegal, would its black market not grow a lot more? That is for the authorities to fight along with the trafficking of human beings (which still exists in Holland and which the authorities fight), not an argument against its legalization.
   Some who speak against prostitution allege that it is an incubus of venereal diseases. Although it is true that sexual intercourse carries the risk of becoming infected from the most harmless ones to the most lethal and awful ones (such as AIDS, one of the dramas of the last decades), we nowadays have a wide selection of instruments to prevent infections (none of which are a hundred percent useful though), condoms being the most popular and safer ones. Besides, legal prostitution would be regulating that, with the subsequent increase in safety during their sexual encounters: prostitutes should be forced to work in a safe way, and clients should oblige by law. It is true that many prostitutes in the world are HIV positive (given the marginal circumstances they work in), although statistics are very confusing about it due to lack of data. Yet once that prostitution was legalized the authorities would see that the safety measures above mentioned were put into action so that no one else, neither prostitute nor client, would become infected. Eventually prostitutes who had AIDS (or the flue for that matter) would obviously have access to the same medical assistance and sick leaves as the rest of the workers. It is quite remarkable how in the porn industry there has not been almost any case of venereal infection throughout its legal history, even though they do not use condoms most of the times. The reason for this is that they have STD tests set on them on a very regular basis. This is, in short, an example of a legal safe sex-related profession whose steps should be followed by prostitution and become what it should have always been: a legal safe profession, if you will excuse the repetition.
    I believe to have proven clearly all along this essay that there is no reason why prostitution should not be legalized, thus receiving the status that it deserves as a profession and its professionals the rights and duties inherent to legal workers. Let us hope that this debate resumes in Parliament soon enough.





   Differences between men and women have been manifest for as long as history allows us to know. We assume that anatomically we have always been different, since we are provided with a quite different set of genitals and reproductive systems which differ yet complement one another. Moreover, most societies in the world have prospered and/or fallen through with men and women who had different functions depending on their sex, who have also shown quite disparate patterns of behavior. As a matter of fact, we only have to look around on the street any random day to grasp the divide: different clothes, different conversation choices and even different way of getting on the bus. Difference, in short, is palpable.
   Yet, even though most people acknowledge gender differences as an undeniable fact, the reasons for such differences is still a topic bound to heat up any conversation if it is brought up. Scholars and institutions in the world, as a matter of fact, are far from reaching agreement considering how opposite their views on the issue are to one another's. It seems that the main tension in the debate could be summed up, taking into account its varying nuances, on a biological or social difference basis. Thus said, this essay is to present the main conflicting views on gender differences and analyze them in perspective, so that we can draw an accurate conclusion after such analysis is carried out.
   It has been believed for quite a long time that gender differences are totally biological, and a lot of people still do. In 1989 a book called Brain Sex, by Anne Moir and David Jessel and which totally supports the biological theory, was published in England by Michael Joseph. Among other things, it said that  <Q>.
   This opinion is validated by countless studies and experiments that show that male brains are different from female brains and hormones define the sex of our behavior, as it were. For instance, researchers from the University of Wisconsin injected testosterone into unborn female monkeys, and their behavior (which is very sex-stereotyped in their species) totally switched to that of a male. 
   Even though all these data could lead us to conclude that gender differences are fully determined by biology, we cannot overlook the fact that some people swap gender roles in some specific situations. It is a fact that some men who are in prison and who had shown a typical male behavior up to that point actually assume feminine roles. They will present a shy, submissive, passive personality, and will be seen by other prisoners as a means of sexual pleasure. Then again, this does not seem to overthrow the biological theory, considering that people who changed their sexual role did so under hostile conditions they had not chosen and, therefore, we cannot be sure that such persons would have done the same in a normal situation. It appears to be more likely that they assume the "female role" in order to achieve social power and protection, not because they actually enjoy it. 
   Another approach to this matter is that of the evolutionists, who claim that gender differences have developed since the Stone Age. In their opinion, social patterns such as the patriarchal family are just a natural evolution of gender differences. That is, if in Prehistory it was men who went hunting and brought raw meat home, now men will do the same thing, only that instead of hunting in the woods they will lay bricks or diagnose terminal diseases. It would also be only natural that women stayed indoors taking care of the children, since evolution gave her the heaviest burden in the reproductive area. According to Robert Jastrow <R>, who has widely studied the evolution of the human brain, <Q>. 
   Feminists all over the world fierce attack this point of view, saying that it is just a sexist and stupid approach aimed merely at validating a "world of men" in which women would be the submissive creatures that have always been because of the male oppression. John Dupr�, in his book Women: A Cultural Review, mildly attacks this theory. He says that most women do not want this nowadays; the modern woman looks for a partner who, among other things, is willing to share the upbringing process with her and accepts her longing for independence. If we take this to be true, the evolutional theory of gender difference would collapse. To be more precise, evolution (which is a quite slow process) could not possibly gender-differentiated behavior if all of a sudden women want things they did not want a few years ago and get closer to men in their approaches. However, the selfsame Dupr� admits that many of these women could be lying, ashamed to admit that they actually crave for a dominant figure to keep her in her "rightful place".
   On the other side of the dispute we find the social difference approach, whose basic belief is that men and women are not so different from one another in essence as they are in real life. To put it another way, it is mainly the existing gender roles that create a divide between man and woman, and not their psychological differences, which are not so many according to people who support this point of view. Janet Shibley Hyde, PhD, of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, has a theory called the "gender similarities hypothesis". In her view, preestablished gender roles affect people's psychological traits and abilities (Teen-Talk Barbie� saying how tough math class is, for instance). That is, gender roles in a given social context greatly define personality more than the other way around (gender-defined personality naturally establishing gender roles in the world). In order to back her theory she made an experiment with several people telling them to behave like they had no particular gender; the result was women behaving in a more aggressive, "masculine" way and men behaving in a more passive, "feminine" way. 
   From such experiment it could be deduced that gender differences are indeed a social (subtle) imposition, something external to us that we accept so as to not be frowned upon by society or simply because it is definitely easier to take on an existing behavior mode rather than figuring out one on your own. In his book  Masculinities R.W. Connells points out this: <Q>.
   
   This seems to suggest that it is social context, and not biology, what makes people assume gender roles. It must be striking for those who believe on biological gender differences alone (and especially for evolutionists) to come across so different a bunch of cultures in which males have occupied roles so diverse. However, it is nonetheless true there is such a thing as sex hormones, which, according to the classical (biologistic) view, fully determine the divide between male and female conducts. Biologist David Crews argues that <Q> <R>. 
   On the other hand, if, as Crew suggests, gender is just a two-way thing, the existence of a third gender in many societies in the world would be yet to be explained. Several indigenous groups in South America, for instance, had the figure of two-spirited people who performed functions of both men and women. usually had sex with both different and same sex people and cross-dressed but did not necessarily cross-act. Once more, all this leads us to the social difference theory and therefore to the unavoidable catch twenty-two of the matter.
   This finally leads us to Queer Theory, which emerged in the last decade as a branch of Gender Studies. Its theorists (such as Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault), according to Wikipedia, claim that identities are not fixed (and therefore cannot be categorized and labeled) because identities consist of many varied components and so it is wrong to categorize by just one characteristic. This sounds quite convincing, for most people would say that people are indeed something more that a certain gender or a certain gender-motored being. But then again others would say that this is yet another catch twenty-two, because if we were to take that as a dogma we could not talk about the color of roses (for there are not two roses in the world displaying an identical color) or anything else. Many scholars agree that in order to acquire knowledge in perspective it is necessary both to acquire it and be aware that it is a necessary convention, a needful lie, as it were. Some others (such as modern feminists for instance), on the other hand, regard this theory as one more step towards total equality between the sexes, due to the fact that, if gender division is demythologized, many sexist arguments against the equality of sexes would fall apart.
     It seems that this analysis of the opinions on gender differences has raised more questions than answers. All points of view we have come across were quite reasonable yet there was always data proving them wrong one way or another. It appears, therefore, that we are still far from reaching a foolproof theory on what makes men and women display differenciated behaviors in so many ways. The only thing we can do, it appears, for the time being, is being cautious when discussing the issue and not being too dogmatic about it, because we would be likely to say things that are not really true. 
   
   







   It is needless to say that we cannot get to know everything that happens around us. There are just too many events to keep track of them all, and most of them would be too insignificant to make us care in case we knew about them. However, it is also true that we get to know less than we could, or would want to. From a five-second segment that can disappear out of a movie to major historical incidents that sometimes never make it to the news, censorship seems to dig its paw into the media whenever it can. According to the New Oxford Dictionary of English, censorship is <Q>.  What is it that we do not get to know? Why do we not get to know that? Is it really necessary that we do not know that? Why is it unacceptable? All these questions hover around most people's minds when they come to think about the problem of censorship in our century. It seems to be only natural that censorship is put into question these days more than in any other time of history; despite there has been censorship regulations in the world for over 1700 years, according to writer Mette Newth in a website called Beacon For Freedom, nowadays freedom of speech and of the press is too important an issue to overlook censorship in any way. Thus said, this essay is to present different opinions on the problem of censorship on a global scope which will then be analyzed through my perspective.
   Most people in favor of censorship have moral arguments. They claim that there are some things that cannot be broadcast for being a flagrant attack on common decency. Such things are mostly sex, drug use, bad language and violence. In New Zealand, the Cinematograph Film Censorship Act of 1916 called these as "<Q>. Their point is that people should not see or hear certain events because those are potentially harmful to them. This kind of mentality has succeeded in many countries, in which, for instance, they beep swearwords out on TV shows and cut out "spicy" parts in movies. 
   However, a lot of people strongly attack this point of view, saying that people should be allowed to see or hear whatever they want, without any restraint whatsoever. They feel that censorship is a restriction to the freedom of speech principle which so many countries have embraced so far, instead of a natural protection against the unpleasant, sick facts of life that the former people talked about. Schwimmer, a Hungarian woman processed in 1929 in a case called the United States vs. Schwimmer for saying that she would not take up arms to defend said country <R>, said in court that <Q>. Even so, many would say that freedom of speech is worth nothing if it means forcing people to watch or hear something that could potentially offend their sensibilities, for instance, randomly hearing a swearword in the middle of a show.
   I think freedom of speech should be above anything. While it is true that some people might be offended with certain sounds or images and they have a right to be protected from them, people's right to publish or broadcast freely is something stronger in my opinion. The world is just not Disneyland, and it is rather foolish to try to make it look as such. The sick, the uneasy, the unpleasant will always be there and we cannot pretend it does not exist by banning its broadcasting or its creative representations. We have to watch, for example, GI's dragging Iraqi prisoners with dog latches because we have to know what is going on if we want to have an opinion about it. I would even say that we have a responsibility to have an opinion about such things.
   This leads me to another consideration. Sometimes the reason that something is censored is basically political, not moral. The Iraqi prisoners' ordeal was banned in the United States, constituting what is the vilest form of censorship to me: topnotch manipulation of people. It could be argued that such censorship (i.e. of political undertone) is still moral, in a patriotic sense. This means that people should love their country more than anything else and therefore they should not be aware of the negative aspects of the latter. This is, in my opinion, an extremely hypocritical view that should not be tolerated. People have to know, and those who do not want to know will probably stay blind of their own free will even if they get the information. However, attempting to keep those who are willing to know blind by keeping the information from them is, in my opinion, appalling. George Orwell depicted the dangers of this kind of mentality quite chillingly in his novel 1984, which talks about an imaginary country where everything, including individual lives and feelings, is censored.
   Some might argue that, even so, not everything is "broadcastable". I could not agree more. If the law is broken and/or people are hurt in order to get fresh material for the audience, such as the so-called "snuff" movies, then it should be persecuted and never broadcast. The same applies to slander, copyright infringement and other offences that violate people's rights. However, the threshold of what is indisputably worthy of being censored and what is not. For instance, many people find bullfights revolting and yet they are on TV every now and then. On the other hand, many people find porn amusing yet the chances of seeing it on TV are awfully scarce. In short, censorable material, such as "broadcastable" material, is something quite hard to define sometimes. 
   Another view on the issue is that of people who think of censorship as a means of protecting children. Several people believe that children should be protected from information that is potentially harmful to them. Such information would be sex, drug use and some other adult themes they are not supposed to have an acquaintance with yet. This view is backed up by a wide research carried out by the American Academy of Pediatrics featured in the website Kids Health. This research states, among other things, that the average eighteen-year-old American boy or girl will have witnessed 200,000 violent acts on TV to that point. The AAP also points out that <Q>. 
   Very well, some might say, but that does not prove that TV or the media in general is responsible for children showing violent behaviors. A number of children aged three already show vicious and aggressive attitudes and it is very unlikely that they got it from watching TV. These people claim either biology or the environment to be responsible for this. However, Harvard psychiatrist Alvin Poussaint, in an interview for parenthood.com website, said that TV does have an influence on children's behavior. He has studied a lot of cases and he declares that <Q>.  One of his cases was a child so obsessed with Power Rangers that he would <Q> after watching the show, and he would even get in fights at school afterwards. Pouissant also regards the child's environment as a key factor in violent behavior nonetheless. 
   The way I see it, children should not stand in the way of the freedom of speech at all. I do not agree with people who argue that children should be blindfolded to the dark side of human nature, or to some adult themes that are not necessary dark for that matter. In my opinion, prohibition means temptation. That means that people are in general more attracted to things which are either outlawed or frowned upon (or both) than commonplace ones, and that includes children. The first cigarette, the first beer, even the first time one has sex feels like an adrenaline overdose if the feeling of breaking a rule is present, for children are too sensible not to sense that there are things around them which are "not OK". The same thing happened right after General Franco's dictatorship in Spain got to an end; countless erotic movies (most of which of the lowest artistic quality) popped up out of the blue in response to the brutal censorship that had existed during the previous era. Oscar Wilde, in his famous novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, said that <Q>.
   Some people might attack my point of view saying that children have to be protected from certain information and scenarios because most parents want them to be. I totally respect that, yet censorship is not a synonym for parenthood; if parents are concerned with what their children watch then I suggest they watch with them and talk to them about what they see. There are many ways of talking about sex or drugs, each of which can be adequate and healthy for a certain age. Although the "blindfolding" attitude saddens me, yet parents have the right to raise their children as they see fit, and I have to respect that, but I cannot respect their trying to blindfold me by means of censorship. 
   We have by now dealt with a few views concerning this awkward issue. People concerned about children, people who support censorship, people who do not... I would finish this essay saying that freedom of speech and information are paramount, and nothing should get on their way, aside from the exceptions that we mentioned earlier. In my opinion, none of the opinions I have discussed so far are strong enough to justify censorship in any way.
