
	It seems that since civilisation began the consume of drugs has been a fact 
which, these days, appears to be concerning a wider range of the worldswide 
population. According to the congressional research services of the United States, <Q> <R> and accordinig to the Russian healthcare officials, 
<Q> <R>, these facts 
are only a few examples of what is probably easy to find in almost any country, what is 
in fact quite frightening, specially if you look at the results from El Observatorio 
Europeo de las Drogas y las Toxicomanï¿½as (OEDT) which in a recent study found out 
that, <Q> <R>. Both, a majority 
of  citizens and governments, seem to be seriously trying to look for a solution to this 
problem but recurrently end up criminalizing and illigalizing the use of these 
substances, as you can see when reading through most of the drug policies around the 
world; or as it happened at Witchford Village Collage, near Ely, where some students 
who were not older than fifteen years old were suspended from school for smoking 
cannabis in the playground <R>. In this essay 
I intend to show from my point of view that these measures above stated do not work as 
a solution to drug addiction but, moreover, in some cases they can even make the 
problem worse.
	As we have already seen, drug addiction is a real problem which definitely 
affects a considerable part of our present society, and which we will have to handle in 
some way or another. I personally belive that drug addicts are not criminals, but just 
unhealthy citizens who suffer from a terrible diseas which, yes, in many cases, they 
might have choosen to start themselves, but mostly in every case, without knowing what 
they were up to. A vast majority of countries have used from the beginning of the war 
against drugs their drug legislation as a weapon to fight against drug addiction, which 
will mainly consist in illegalization and criminilazation of the use and consume of these: 
<Q> <R>. The problem comes when these measures 
aren't enough to end with the problem, and so, many governments decide to establish 
more strict laws regarding drug abuse, as you can see: <Q> <R>. However, this approach to the illegalization of drugs doesn't 
seem to be giving positive results, as the number of drug addicts seem to be increasing. 
These shows that imprisionment does little to cure this habit and its why some people 
have started to think about other kind of solutions. For instance, the Health officer 
council of B.C. (Canada) said, <Q> <R>. 
Although this is something that most people will find as completly mad, for my part, I 
believe that it is the best and only way to have a complete control over these substances 
and their consumers.
	Another true statement we can do is that even drugs are illegal in most countries 
nearly everyone can have a presumely easy acces to these. This means, first of all that 
there has to be someone who gets to smuggle them into the country, which creates the 
existences of mafias which get to control the drug market. This also means there's no 
one to control on the quality or price of the drugs themselves. These are the reasons why 
a personally tend to belive that drugs shouldn't be illegalised, because this way there is 
no State control over them. Many people would argue that the legalisation of drugs 
would be hellerious because it would mean the state's and social approval to the 
consume of these, as it has happened with alcohol or tabacco. However, I strongly 
believe that we have to stick to reality, and the actual fact is that people do consume 
drugs and they manage to find them even as thay are, illegal. These causes other 
problems such as drug trafficking and farming which can even mean that the economies 
of certain countries, such Afganistan, mainly depend on the cultivation of opium. 
Something needs to be done to face this problem but even though <Q> <R> according to the 
organisation's supreme allied comander in Europe. This can sometimes end up by being 
a source of money to terrorists who then can improve thier internal structures.
	Another point which is important to understand is the fact that teenagers these 
days start consuming drugs in earlier ages. Of course, this is a problem that doesn't 
concern each and every adolescent but as the figures are is starting to concern many 
people. The most important problem is that some of these youngsters are used by mafias 
to distribute the illicit drugs as they won't get  so hard sentences because they are 
underage. From these, I personally feel that the illegalisation and punishment for the use 
of drugs doesn't stop teenagers from trying them and so other measures should be taken. 
Many people would say that the only way of ending with the problem of drug abuse is 
education, but are we really giving these education to are teenagers? Are we providing 
them with enough preventing information about this topic? Or is it still a taboo which 
we prefer to avoid until the problem arrives? And after it has arrived, do we really give 
them the neccessay information to help them quit? Some people who are against the 
legalisation of drugs and most of the governments will say they are working hard to 
provide these help and education. However, what we can see from evidence is that when 
the moment comes of facing the problem most of them will try to look away from it as 
it happened at Witchford School were the headmaster, after having found some students 
<Q> said that <Q>  but what he actually did was to suspend the boys as he had already done with 
another case of students found in possesion of drugs on-site <R>. These, personally speaking, doesnt appear to me as the best way of 
educating teenagers against the use of drugs.
	To conclude, after having stated what from my point of view are the main 
problems of the illegalisation of drugs, I personally think that it is the moment for 
governments to forget their ethic and moral prejudices and start thinking seriously on 
the legalisation and control of drugs, as it seem to me that can help with the real 
problem of drug addiction.	



       As it can be seen in different religious texts <Q> <R>.  For centuries, the 
existence of some herbs which had the properties of avoiding pregnancy was common 
knowledge for all the different religions, and so for all their societies. This was 
impossible to control and nobody really knew whether women were using a 
contraceptive method or not. In modern times, and with the industrialization and the 
scientific advances which society has been through, men and women have the 
opportunity to choose among a considerable wide range of contraceptive methods. 
These can have a temporary effect, as for instance happens with all kind of barrier 
methods (such as male and female condom, diaphragm, cervical cup...), spermicides, 
hormonal treatments (such as the birth control pill, hormonal patch and ring, injectable 
homonal treatments...) and intrauterine devices (IUDs); or irrevocable practices, as 
vasectomy and tubal ligation. All these are contraceptive tecniques which prevent the 
fertilisation of the egg(ouvum), but there is also another kind of contraceptive system 
that would prevent the implantation of a potentally fertilised egg, as for instance the 
morning-after pill. It is recommened to use this last method only on a case of 
emergency, and one of the reasons for it is that it is not as effective as the others. Some 
people argue that the best way to prevent having an unwanted child is to resort to sexual 
abstinence. All of them have side effects, some of them of minor gravity, others quite 
more important, but they don't necessarily have to deal with physical problems, they 
can also involve mental health. This is why some factors, such as age, lifestyle and 
health will influence the decision taken. Probably due to the existence of so many 
different methods which work in so different ways with the common objective of 
avoiding pregnancy, which is a very controversial issue, as it deals with the life of a 
new born, there are several different points of view regarding the use of contraceptives. 
We can distingush clearly between those who are totally against the use of 
contraceptives and who compare them to abortion; some organisations which defend 
their use not only as a human right to enjoy safe sex, but also as a tool to avoid giving 
birth to unwanted children, Sexual Transmitted Deseases (STDs), overpopulation...; 
even though the majority of people seem to have a mid-term opinion concerning this 
issue, people generally agree with the function of contraceptives as a way to prevent 
deseases but they are not comfortable with the idea that some people take advantage of 
contraceptives to have promiscuous relationships. In this essay I intend to comment on 
the different arguments about the use of contraceptives.
       To begin with, it seems that the concept of sex has radically changed in the past 
few years, in our western society. In a majority of cases, if we think of what society 
tended to believe fifty years ago, the term sex was socially acceptable, and nearly 
always related to the presence of love and marriage, especially when talking of Spain. It 
may be reasonable to argue that this is due to the great influence catholic believes have 
always had over every asspect of the Western Society throughout history. These days, it 
could be argued that, for quite a lot of people, marriage nor love is needed as a 
condition in order to satisfy sexual necessity, so the aim of reproduction is totally lost 
and the risk of conciving unwanted children is high. These seems a reason important 
enough  for many people to be in favour of the use of contraception, as the mental 
health of the mother can be damaged by the birth of an unwanted child. Also, it seems 
generally agreed that a poor economic and social background can get to harm the 
youngster, sometimes to a point that his parents can't afford to mantain him. This 
argument seem quite reasonable, as the health of the mother and the future of the child 
seem very important factors to take into account when talking of giving birth to a baby. 
When talking of underdeveloped countries the risk of having a health problem while 
giving birth is even higher, and so the use of contraception is accepted even to a greater 
extent. 
       Even though, the possible main arguments for the use of contraceptive methods 
seem to be their prevention to STDs and their family planing potential seen as a solution 
to control the overpoplation problem. The problem of STDs seem to be one concerning 
a majority of the sexually active popullation and the Health Care Authorities. Although 
the risk of getting infected by AIDS is the most serious one there are numerous other 
STDs such as chlamydia, genital herpes, gonorrhea, hepatitis.... Health Care Authorities 
such as the National Institute of Health (NIH) highly recommend the use of 
contraception, specially the use of the male latex condom as <Q> <R>. This may be the reason why many people claim the 
necessity of the distribution of free condoms in underdeveloped countries, such as 
African ones, where the numer of people infected by AIDS is much larger. According to 
UNAID, AIDS epidemic update from december 2004, <Q> <R>. This seems a reasonable argument in favour of the 
use of contraception as we are dealing with humans health and lives, moreover if there 
is no use of contraception and there is AIDS infection the new born will be infected too. 
The problem of over population has lead to acts such as <Q>. For both, the health of the mother, the child and the male member of the 
couple, and the need of having a control over the world population in countries such as 
China, there are people who claim that the use of all kind of contraceptives needs to be 
extended to everyone, specially when having an expontanious sexual relationship.
       On the other hand we have the Catholic Church and the anti-abortion 
conservatives. These seem to focus on the catholic belive that sex out of marriage is 
undeniable, as it shouldn't be to the service of satisfying human sexual needs but it 
should only take place with a reproductive aim. They argue that if it is used properly 
and only in a settled couple with the expectation of having children then there would be 
no need of using contraception, what seems quite reasonable. They also claim that the 
only way and the safest one of assuring the prevention of STDs and unwanted children 
is abstinence. This has impulsed the arise of training programs such as WAIT (Why Am 
I Tempted) which <Q> <R>.
       In contrast to the judeo-christian understanding of the sexual act for the mere 
sense of reproduction, in the rest of the majoritarian religions it is also seen as a need in 
order to satisfy the couple's necessities. That is way Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism are 
not against the use of contraceptive tecniques. <Q> is the reason why this 
religions are partly in favour of the use of contraception. Once the egg has been 
fertilised then they believe life has been created, so only contraceptive methods that 
prevent the fertilisation of the egg would be valid for the, this means they are against 
abortion and the use of contraceptives such as the mornin-after pill  <R>. It 
seems quite reasonable they distinguish between both types of contraception as their 
values in what respect to "life" are very concrete.
       There also seem to be a lot of catholics who support this mid-term view about 
contraception, because they are conscious of the riks of getting infected by STDs and 
the consequences an unwantged pregnancy could have. Thse would normally use those 
who prevent the fertilisatin and not those which prevent the implantation. They also see 
a disadvantage to the use of contrception and is the premature approach of our teenagers 
to sexuality, which can end up meaning a bad usage of the contraceptive methods, that 
then can brin health problems, menta lproblems and unwanted babies.
       To conclude, we can see there are many arguments both for and against the use 
of contraceptives. Some defend the respect for life and so condemn the use of those who 
act after the fertilisation has occured, others seem to condemn the actual sexual act if it 
is not with the target of reproduction , and finally there are others who seem the more 
reasonable which defend the mental and physical health of both participants of the 
sexual act and the future bay, and which is the one that is in favor of the use of 
contraception.
