In our country there are many types of problems but this essay will only treat with the physical ill-treat to the women,with the sexual abuses to the children and with the inmigrants because this three social issues are the most given these days.
In this essay I intend to show the problems that suffer many people and it is shows as we can help.

The first problem is the physical ill-treat to the women,I think that the man who abuses of the woman should be in jail and remain there a long time.In my point of view they should feel the same thing that a woman feels when she is hit.A recent study says that each year the women's dead increases too.In 2001,one hundred four women were murdered for their husbands and one year later twelve more.While the women try to make up in the society,whose results are being objetives,the abuses are increasing.In consequency,we cannot say that the woman's situation has improved too.A good help to this situation would be that the politic's helps were more effectives.It should have more measures which protect the women.In England,It is said that the best measure is that the woman has a bodyguard who  watches over her house and goes with her.There are differents opinions about this but I think that can be a good measure because if your husband wants to do anything you are going to have somebody that can help you.We supposedly are not in a traditional society where the woman is lower.It is said that the mind of the people is open to new ideas and people haven't  this traditionals and unfairs ideas however I don't believe it.Also,many men think if the women do anything which they don't like they have the right of hit them.Moreover,they believe to show their superiority but in my point of view when a man hit a woman,the man loses his dignity and he shows cowardice.This is an actual fact which is very serious,so when we have a near event we don't have to doubt,we have to go to the police and denounce it.This kind of people must be in jails.


Other problem is the sexual abuse to the children which is a terrible fact.Many people say to be worried by this fact and they argue that need more security for their children.In this case,I intend to argue how we can try to avoid this experiences.I think that all the protections are fews,but there are any method for being more calm.
A recent study shows us a simple method which consists in giving a countersign to the child.This countersign can only be known by authorized people.Thus,when somebody goes at school for coming for to the child,both have to say the countersign,and if one of them doesn't know it ,the child won't go with him/her.This measure is being applied in many schools and  is being transformed in a law when it is put as a general norm.There are people who think that this method is useless because anything passes if it has to pass.They relation this facts with the destiny.Yet,I would suggest that if we don't try to put measures,our sons will be less safe.Furthermore,all are few for the security of our sons.


Finally,the other problem is the inmigration.Nowadays the level of inmigration is increasing.Many people seem to feel worried by recent increases of inmigration.
I think that the figures are too high and this can have problems.One of the problems is the lack of personal and the lack of places where the inmigrants remain a time moreover of others as the scope educational,the scope sanitary....so on.There are many people who don't like them,apart from their nationality,moreover because they think that with their arrived the vandalism is going to increase.I believe that the vandalism can increase but if they have more opportunities,many of them won't have to steal to can eat.Many of us only come looking for a future.I think that the people need an opportunity.

So then,we have seen three social problems which nowadays are happening.The most important of these problems is a characteristic that all have in common which is the harm and the suffering (children,adults,inmigrants...).On the basis of this,I would recommended that we should respect and help to this people.All are humans.
