Looking at the last of these latter elements, one can think that this is an eternal problem and find reasons to argue that is the same to buy a house in our days than in our parents ones. I personally believe that different circumstances make housing problem one of main difference between generations.   
     
     Today, young people leave their house later than generation before. There aren't so many people that can say that started their life alone after the thirties in our days. Is true that comfort life with mum's protection and with everything done, can make that we don't want to leave the paradise. However, when the little bird wants to fly, someone say to him that must have enough money for the first pay of the mortgage, around twenty per cent, the reason to return to the parent's house five more years.
     
     Next thing is the high price of mortgage. For example, the price a new construction house is around 450.000 €, in our parents generation it was around 50.000 €. The most usual answer to this reasoning is that salaries have change too. Yes, salaries have change too, but I think that there is something different, because if the people of previous generation could pay their houses in ten years, why the people of our generation are going to pay their mortgage in forty years? The answer is easy too, comparing prices and salaries, the houses that our generation has to buy are more expensive than the other ones.
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     
     Another difference is the cultural change. Nowadays, to buy a house is impossible without women's salary, they work like men and banks are use to demand this second salary to accept the mortgage. Someone can think that we aren't in front of a really cultural change, someone can think that is only a money problem. I don't think so, because without the working women, actual system, talking about housing problem, would be different, because this system needs two of the family's salaries.
     
     The difficulty to find a "cheap" house near the main cities, is something that make young people discard the idea of buy a new house. Farness from main cities make young people have to buy a car or motorcycle, because most of they, work and have their points of job in the biggest cities. This is a fact that can be consider not important, because to have every thing is impossible, but I think that if we could have all other circumstances easier than now, the farness to job would not be a problem to buy a house, but now is something which increase the list.
     
     In conclusion, it is clear from my point of view that is very different to buy a house nowadays than in our parent's time. The difficulties that young people find to leave their houses early, most expensive price of mortgage in Spanish's history and the cultural changes and farness from the main cities, make houses a luxury article. I believe that unless politicians find a solution for housing problem, young people must have to live in their parent's house until they inherit it.
