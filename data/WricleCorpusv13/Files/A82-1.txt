Bullfighting is considered as an art in Spain. It basically consists in a bullfighter in a bulling, where she or he fights bulls in a special maner, doing specific movements.As the show go through, the bullfighter has to sick some kind of savoury, later a sword too,as the animal fall down to the sand.The show ends with an exhibition of the died animal around the bullring. In this essay I'm going to expose the diferent points of view related to bullfighting.

Many people think, that there is a typical spanish custom,fests,or art,specially perverse. One of theme is bullfighting,considered as an art by experts and people who enjoy it, but considered as cruel by other group of peole,that do not aprove it.They said,it is a very inhuman way of misstreat an animal, and what is more,is perverse to do it like a show,where people enjoy their time.Also,they are disagree with the foreign marketing and publicity that is done with it,said that could make think to foreing people that our culture is a primitive and crudely one.It is reasonable to argue that is not necessary that foreing people think this about us,because they could think the same about the pig butchery, or the cow butchery too,which are for human consume.But it is reasonable that is not sensible make a show with the died of an animal.

From another point of view, some people buttress the show of bulls,in the sens that it is traditional,and they enjoy it, but this people are desagree with some aspects,for example,killing the bull.It could be a great show to exhibit the courage of a bullfighter in the bullring, but they do not like the part when they have to kill the animal.In addition to that,they also consider inapropiate the exhibition of it on TV,because, they defend the rights of children,and talk about their miss-education respect to violence. This thought, is more against bullfighting that for it,but it is clear that this people think more about the violence seen by humans,that about the animal victim.It apears that, they are completely in favour of a "health" TV  and not violent,but it  must be considered that some years ago, bullfighting was broadcasted more frecuently that nowadays, that it is not broadcasted in the public channels.

There is another point of view,completely for the bullfighting,where I include the bullfighters,obviusly, and the fanatics of this kind of show.They estimate it as an acient culture,that could not dessapear.If it happens,the spanish culture based on a courage iberic men,will dessapear.This argument apears to be really primitive.Is correct to respect the show for the people who like it, but in our culture there are many more aspects prettier and more attractive that this one.

To conclude,we can see that there are two clearly defined thoughts about this art,against and for.The first reflect about how could the animal suffer in the bullring,and how cruel it appears;the second one consider it basic in our culture because was invented many years ago.Therefore,there is another one that could be against it considering other aspects than violence to the animal,that is the violence that humans seen,specially the children.So,it is difficult to determnate if this show must be abolish and supress of spanish culture,or in the opposite case,we must not disturb it,or otherwise,change some specific rules, to make it less violent. Perhaps we would have to change it,but it would be as to change one aspect of the spanish tradition for the people who enjoy it,but,really it is a controverse decision.
