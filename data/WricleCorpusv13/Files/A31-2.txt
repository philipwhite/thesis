          In 2010 Spain will have 45'6 millions of inhabitants and in 2050 will  reach 53'14 millions of inhabitants. This increase of population is because of  inmigration, since foreign women make pregnant younger than spanish women  and they have more children. Besides, illegal inmigratns arrive to spanish coast  continuously. This inmigrants come from countries less developed. In 1985 was  the first process to regularize foreigner in spain. There are 131.000 from  Ecuador, 111.000 from Colombia, 32.500 from Rumania, 27.000 from  Argentina, 12.935 from Marruecos and 32.000 are from the rest of countries.          The presence of inmigrants without documents is permanent in Spain.  Inmigrants from Africa arrive small boats or hide in lorries. Now, spanish  authorities have more control in the south cosast of sapin but it is more dificult  to have control of latin inmigrants, that come here like turist but later they stay  here with an illegal situation. Spanish authorities are trying to stop pile up or  unhealthy situations, but inmigrants resist to register because they fear to be  control.          In one hand we have that in Spain, politics, TV, radio and newspapers  talk everyday about inmigration. With inmigration population have increase and  agriculture have survived. Authorities tells that delinquency has incease  because inmigrants have a worse economic situation, and because of the  diferences between people from diferent countries. Inmigrants work where  spanish people don't want work but as most of them do not have documents in  some cases employers pay inmigrants less than a spanish person.  Gouvernment try that society treat inmigrants with tolerance and give foreigners  the same rights like   spanish people and help them to integrate.          In the other hand we have that spanish society think that there are  more illness in spain  because of inmigrants, even illness that didn't exist here.  Besides that delinquence have increase since inmigrants are here because they  are very aggressive and they do not respect our rules. They are many spanish  people that do not want to have an inmigrant like a neighbour. Also spanish  people think that inmigrants come here to take our work.          Spain the country of the U.E that has the highest increase in  inmigration. Inmigration has increase 40% in spain, delinquency has increase  too. Inmigration is the issue that spanish people are more worry about. Anyway  in spain there are two diferent opinions about this issue, one is the opionion of  the gouvernment that are for inmigration and two is the opionion of the most the  society that are against inmigrants and the rest are mid opinions that are less  and are less clear because this people do not want to be racial but there are  some things about inmigrants that they do not like.
