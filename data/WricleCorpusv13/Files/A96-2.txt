											Nowadays the consumption of soft drugs as marijuana or hachis,is very usual in our contry and in othres European contries despite the fact that is illegal. Holland is the only European contry that let to sell maximum five grammes of cannabis in coffeeshops or possess little quantities of soft drugs but is not legal.Although it is illegal we can found drugs in every European country and government have been thinking about the legalisation to evit the traffic of drugs.Many people think that the legalisation is good for some aspects, other people are completely against this resolution for others reasons and many people want to use marijuana with the aim of doing more bearable some treatments very hard against the cancer.in this essay I am going to show the different arguments that people use about the legalisation.				
Some people think that soft drugs,such as hachis or marijuana,are not alarming products because in their opinion this products can be as normal as tobacco or also because they think that these drugs have the same effects that the tabacco.But this can be discussed because smoking a big quantity of marijuana produces hallutinations and smoking a lot of tobacco doesn't.There are people that say that the legalisation of soft drugs could diminish the number of crimes because many of them are produced by drug addicts in state of anxiety to buy and consume drugs,and if they can get theirs drugs easily they won't commit this actions, and they don't feel marginalized by the other people.And the last reason because there are people in favour of this reason is that if drugs are legalized there aren't traffic drugs and will have less delinquency,less mafias and people who send drugs can be normal people and they aren't delinquent, and could have a normal life with teirs family and their sons and daughters would not be deeply marked by be duahter of a criminal.				Other people think that if we legalize soft drugs could increase the consume because all the people would have access to this drugs and the teenagers that are irresponsible could fall in the drugs because despite the fact that there are a lot of information the number of people that consume drugs in our contry is increasing the way alarming.One of this reason is that nowadays is easier than some years ago to get drugs because everybody know that in discos or in some specifics areas we can get drugs.						Also have to see that the legal drugs that are tobacco and alcohol are the drugs more consumed and thousand of people are dead by them.It's said by importants doctors that public healt system spend hundred of million to attent to illnes cused by tobacco.			Finally,there are people that only want to legalize the marijuana to send this plant in the chemist's shops, by example in Cataluña because sicks of cancer that are with treatment of chemotherapy lose the appetite and have nauseas and it is checked that if the consume marijuana this symptoms are reduced also it's said that could be good to anorexia because increse the appetite and also can de used by  HIV-positive. 					So then, there are many arguments in favour of the fact that drugs could be legal because they think that marijuana is similar to tobacco and for them is not an alarmic product and the lagalisation could help to reduce the number of criminals because the people that sell this product are considered as a criminal.On the other hand,there are people that think that it can increase the number of adicts to this substances and doctors that say that tobacco is very harmful by health and marijuana also it is.On balance, the legislation of soft drugs in Spain might be the begining of a vicious circle where more people woul feel the temptation to try drugs.But there are an opption that could be good this is that marijuana could be in chemist to ills whit doctor's prescription.
