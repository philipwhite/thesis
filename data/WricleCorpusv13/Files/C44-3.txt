This way Spain joined Belgium, the Netherlands and Canada as the only countries worldwide where homosexuals can marry and where they are put on a level with heterosexual couples regarding civil rights. While for some people this law represents a triumph of tolerance, some others state that it threatens the traditional institutions of marriage and family. With regard to these matters, one of the most controversial articles of the law is the one that envisages the possibility of adoption by homosexual couples. Up to now, lesbian and gay people could apply for adoption just as individuals, and that was the reason why they had always fewer possibilities to adopt a child than stable heterosexual couples. Although many studies examining children raised by gay parents have been made in the last years, the results seem to be contradictory, partial and strongly politicized. Regarding public opinion, the spectrum of approaches to this issue is also wide. Some sectors, typically represented by left-wing voters, defend without reservations the right of gay people to adopt. Other groups, many of them attached to conservative, right-wing or Christian associations, have expressed themselves against gay adoption. On the other side, a great percentage of people admit the theoretical right to adopt, but consider that this right can come into conflict with the child's interest, and therefore it cannot be completely put on a level with the right of heterosexual couples. For these people, a heterosexual environment can provide a more adequate climate for the development of children, even when they defend the right of same sex couples to regularize their relationship. The basic difference between the right to adopt children and the right to marry is that the former must be always determined by the right of children themselves. While some years ago adoption has provided a service to adults who desired a child, the intent of modern adoption practice is to provide a service to children. In this essay I will expose and analyse the different scopes about the right of gays to adopt, and how the approval of this right is, in my opinion, aimed at children's best interest.

      Among the arguments that are used against gay adoption, we can find some that are based either on religious or moral convictions about homosexuality. Certain sectors (in Spain, mainly Catholic communities) consider homosexuality as an unnatural behaviour that threatens the divine order and that may and must be treated, as if it were a disease, for the benefit of the individual and society. Although these arguments must be respected, it seems to me that there is no place for them in a debate of a non-denominational state as Spain, that is, a State that cannot build its social policy nor its legal system from the beliefs of a certain creed, even when it represents most of the citizens. Of course, it is normal that there are all kinds of disagreements in a multi-cultural society about what is moral and what is immoral, especially when not everybody professes a religion. For example, some people may think that raising children without religion is immoral, yet atheists are allowed to adopt or to be foster parents. I strongly believe that, as in this case, the adoption by homosexual couples must be judged on the basis of children's benefit, and never on the subjective considerations of certain sectors of society, no matter how powerful or influential they may be.

      Nevertheless, there exist other arguments against gay adoption that seem to be far away from religious sphere, but that also take into account some considerations on the hypothetical characteristic nature of the homosexual individual and, specially, of the homosexual couple. In this sense, a senior Vatican official asserted that <Q> <R>. I have not found reliable figures regarding how many Spanish gays and lesbians are in lasting committed relationships. Nevertheless, the adoption and foster care screening process is very rigorous, including extensive home visits and interviews of prospective parents. I think that these measures should be enough to determine the stability of a relationship, both in the case of gay or heterosexual parents. There are, however, other voices that bring more serious charges against homosexuality. For example, homosexual behaviour is sometimes related to a tendency towards paedophilia, so lesbians and gays could be more likely to molest children. The truth seems to be that all of the legitimate scientific evidence shows that about 90% of child abuse is committed by heterosexual men <R>. Personally speaking, I strongly believe that these and other similar considerations on homosexual nature (a trend towards violence, emotional instability...) are nothing but prejudices based on ignorance and on the old idea that minority sexual options are typical of degenerate people. 

      Other sectors accept and respect homosexual couples, but base their refusal to gay adoption on the harmful influence that homosexual environment might have on the psycho-emotional development of the child himself. These groups assert that the best environment for the well being of children is a household with a mother and a father, from which the child may take the female and male roles, respectively <R>. In my opinion, this idea comes from the belief that woman should provide the child with love and emotional support, and men should provide strength, courage and leadership roles. This is the old conception of a traditional Spanish family, but it is obvious that the distribution of roles is in fact different in many families (single-parent homes are clear examples), and that it has never been a reason to deny them the right to adopt. Anyway, it must be highlighted that children without homes have not even a mother or a father as role models. There are also similar voices that claim that homosexual environment can model homosexual behaviour to children. The truth is that not a single study has proved children of gay parents more likely to be gay; neither that homosexuality is a cultural and not a biological behaviour. After all, there is no doubt that most homosexual people have been brought up by heterosexual couples, their parents. Golombok and Tasker, researchers of the Department of Developmental Psychology <R>, affirm that <Q>. But this is just evidence that those children could be more tolerant of diversity, which in my opinion is certainly not a disadvantage. On the other hand, I believe the argument to be highly hypocritical: if those groups really accept homosexuality, they would not care if those children had a slightly higher probability of experimenting homosexual relations. 

      There are also people who keep an ambiguous attitude towards gay adoption. They theoretically accept it because they believe that every stable loving home, even the one built by a homosexual couple, is preferable for children to an unstable life jumping from one orphanage to another. However, they feel that, in practice, the sexual orientation of the appliers must be taken as another criterion to evaluate them as parents, and concretely that heterosexual couples must be given precedence over homosexual ones. Since the number of appliers is huge, that almost means to deny them the right to adopt. They argue that the natural and normal environment for the growth of a child is a heterosexual one, and that we do not know yet the real consequences that the unprecedented social experiment of the homosexual family could have, especially regarding the integration of those children into society. They affirm that gay people cannot put their personal desires above the right of these children to have a normal family, and that kids deserve the best possible chance at a normal, healthy family instead of using them to try a cultural statement that has nothing to do with them. These groups find one of their most solid arguments in the discrimination those children would have to face in their social environment (school, friends...), independently from the good working within the familiar nucleus. It would be pointless to deny that children make fun of others for many reasons, and one of them could be perhaps the fact of having two fathers or two mothers. However, it seems to me that, unlike children in foster care, those children would have at least emotional support from their families to help them through their problems. Actually, the President of the Asociación de Madres Lesbianas y Padres Gays de COGAM  <R> states that <Q>. For example, the Spanish LOGSE includes the need for educating children to work for values like peace and respect for diversity. It appears to me that, if this measure was fulfilled, it would undoubtedly help to solve the problems of harassment and victimization those children might have.

      Let's consider finally those people who claim for the right of gays to adopt, as for example homosexual themselves. They base their support both on the right of children to an adequate home and their own right to equality. On the one hand they state that, given that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that lesbian and gay people are unfit to be parents, homosexual environments are as likely to successfully support a child's development as those with heterosexual parents, and that therefore gay adoption does not conflict with children's rights. They especially insist on the fact that many older or disabled children that are hard to place would find finally a home. They reject the idea that the presence of a father and a mother is a requirement for good parenting since there exist many other models of family whose children grow up as happy, healthy and well-adjusted as the children of heterosexual parents. Kathy Belge, a lesbian freelance writer, points out that according to the 2004 census, only 42% Spanish homes were composed of a married mother and father with their children, and that in most of them, children seem to be more influenced by the interaction with their parents than by sexual orientation <R>. On the other hand, and regarding gay individuals' rights, they consider that a person's sexual orientation cannot be the basis for ending or limiting parent-child relationships unless it is demonstrated that it causes harm to a child, in the same way that it cannot be the reason for denying another civil right. To this respect, a member of the Child Welfare League of America <R> states <Q>. I must say I personally agree with those arguments. Of course, they present a clear weakness, and this is that there is not definitive evidence to support the idea that homosexual and heterosexual couples have the same ability to parent. And yet it appears to me that the rigorous process of selection developed by an Adoption Court must be enough to determine if two adults in a committed relationship are prepared or not to assume responsibility for looking after a child, independently from their sexual orientation.

      In conclusion, this essay has presented some different approaches to the question of the right of lesbians and gays to adopt. In an attempt to systematize those approaches, I have divided them as if they were clear and separate attitudes, on the basis of the fact that each group of opinion often puts forward the same characteristic arguments. Unfortunately, the actual spectrum of opinions is much more complicated, and it implies very different kind of arguments and considerations: moral, religious, legal, cultural, personal... From those who do not support the recognition of gay couples as legal unions to those who claim for the right of gays and lesbians to adopt there is an enormous distance. Of course, the controversy is likely to continue since many arguments are still based on speculation and not on proved facts, and the question to solve is still how to determine the best adoptive resource for a child. Actually, <Q> <R>. From my point of view, adoption in Spain cannot be used, as just a few years ago, to place healthy white babies in the homes of middle class, married couples. Our adoption policy must deal with reality, and the reality is that those traditional familiar nucleuses exist side by side with new models of family and coexistence that are today finally recognized. Those families must therefore have the chance to become stable and loving homes for the growth of children.
