criminality. The "Ley del Menor", was promulgated 5 years ago, and it is necessary to 
take stock of it, and reflect about its rights and wrongs. Studies reveal that there has 
been a significant increase in the amount of violent offences committed by underage 
teens. That is the reason why our government has announced their intention to reform 
the "Ley de Responsabilidad Penal del Menor" to confront this phenomenon. This new 
legislative text intends to reconcile educative measures with an improvement of the 
victim's protection.  The implications of this law have awakened the concern of the 
different associations mainly interested in this issue. In this essay, I am going to explain 
the different main flaws of this new law and why, in my opinion these changes are not 
enough to confront underage crime.

The first important flaw I see is the lack of personal and material means to rehabilitate 
and resocialize these problematic youngsters. The government has delegated the 
responsibility to afford the infrastructures and the specialised professionals needed for 
this task to each Autonomous Region (Comunidad Aut�noma). According to F�lix 
Herrero, Fiscal Jefe of Le�n,
<Q> <R>
In Madrid, for example, 57.7% of the 600 underage youngsters that were arrested, 
should have been confined in a closed-regime due to the seriousness of the offence, but 
the four centres that Madrid has for these violent teens, have a capacity of just 97 
people. However, there are many specialists like Emilio Calatayud, Magistrate of the 
Underage Court of Granada, that claim that condemning underage youngsters to stay in 
a juvenile centre is not the correct way to rehabilitate them. Instead, he prefers to apply 
instructive and educative sentences <R>. Nevertheless, from my point of 
view, this argument completely forgets about those youngsters who have committed 
violent crimes such as murder, homicide and rape; these kind of faults, are not so easy 
forgivable or forgettable for our society and our individual moral code.  

This issue leads me to another major flaw I appreciate in the application of the law; and 
that is the fact that, in my view there is not a good reason to abandon the intimidatory 
and preventive perspective of the punishment, since it is considered one of the ways to 
educate teens. Most people know that fear to be imprisoned is a very effective 
dissuasive element that will be partially lost if this law is carried out, because it will 
reduce its intimidating character by cutting down or changing the sentences by 
alternative chores. This fact, depending on the offence, may seem to be very 
"profitable" for the offender. On the other hand, magistrates in charge of these kind of 
cases, claim that what needs to be changed is society's vindictive culture to a more 
rehabilitating one. We should not put ourselves in the place of the parents' victim but on 
the skin of the parents' of the underage boy or girl that commits the crime and think 
about how we would like our son to be treated.  However, this type of "soft measures" 
would result in the indignation of a great part of our society, which would make the law 
fairly unpopular and severely criticised. These measures would also probably cause 
serious and ultimate incidents between the victim's angered family and the offender as 
it has happened many times before. 

The third flaw I have found is that the possibility of making a private prosecution is not 
permitted in any case, not even in those that are considered violent crimes. A private 
prosecution occurs when an individual, or a group of individuals, gathers evidence of a 
wrongdoing and lays charges against the alleged offender. The police and/or 
government are not involved in the matter. Essentially, the individual takes matters into 
his/her own hands and plays the role of the police or enforcement body. Spanish law 
considers that every person has the right to initiate a private prosecution against an 
alleged perpetrator in any matter that constitutes a violation of the Criminal Code. 
However, some people may argue that, if the family of the victim is allowed to lay a 
private prosecution, the conditions they will ask for may be under the influence of their 
anger towards the offender, so they will not be objective enough to appreciate under 
which circumstances the underage youth committed the fault. But, this is not completely 
true, since there are means in the law, firstly, to prevent that the defendant is offended 
and secondly, to watch over his/her interests. The presence of the victim could even be a 
good way to make the youngsters understand the seriousness of their acts. It makes no 
sense the fact that the victim cannot lay a private prosecution but he or she is asked to 
give his/her conformity to adopt any measure. 

Finally, another major aspect, which is hardly mentioned in the new law for underage 
youngsters, is the issue of consciousness. The Spanish Constitution sets that we reach 
the majority of age at 18 years old. That implies many things: from driving a car to 
voting in the elections. That is what the law says, but reality is, unfortunately, quite 
different. We have to bear in mind that maturity is a stage, and it is an important issue to 
think about when writing laws. If a teen is capable of acting freely as a mature person, 
he or she should also be capable of assuming the consequences and responsibilities of 
his/her acts. Nevertheless, some psychologists claim that maturity depends on many 
factors that combine in different ways depending on each person. Therefore, the 
development of a consciousness does not depend as much on the age but on the 
circumstances that surround each individual, so, according to this fact, we should not 
establish a law building a precise frontier of age between maturity and immaturity, 
because this would not represent the reality.  But, actually, that frontier needs to be 
established at some point in our life, in which our character is supposed to be formed, 
and that seems to be the age of 18. In addition to this, I should say that, even people 
who has not reached the majority of age know how to distinguish good from bad 
although the may not be completely conscious of their consequences.  

To conclude, it is clear that from my point of view, this new reform of the "Ley del 
Menor" should be revised again to solve the many flaws it has. The most important ones 
are: the absence of means to put into practise the resocialization of youngsters, the 
smoothening of the punishment since it is not considered educative anymore, the 
prohibition of making a private prosecution, even in violent crimes, and the fact that in 
the legal text, the issue of a teen being conscious about his/her acts and consequences is 
not even mentioned. Having described some of the main problems of the new law, my 
opinion is that a solution is not to be reached any time soon. There may be continuous 
struggles between the victim and his/her relatives and the offender, due to the softness 
or the harshness of the sentence imposed. Meanwhile the government will continue 
trying to reach a consensus with which both parts are satisfied.

In the last decades, there is certain controversy regarding the issue of legalising same-
sex couple's marriage. This question is being debated in many countries such as the 
USA or Spain. Spain's governing Socialist Party, has legalized gay marriage on June 
30, despite the opposition of the Vatican and bishops who consider this fact as a  hard 
challenge to traditional values. <R>   Another example of legalization 
of homosexual marriage can be found in the Netherlands, as many people know, this 
country has almost always been ahead when talking about same-sex couples' rights. A 
form of gay marriage has been legal in Denmark since 1989 (full marriage rights except 
for adoption rights and church weddings, and a proposal now exists in the Danish 
parliament to allow both of those rights as well) <R> This social 
debate is not about to disappear soon. In this essay I will try to analyse the different for 
and against arguments concerning the topic of the legalisation of gay matrimony.

The main argument against same-sex couples marriage, is mostly held by some 
religious groups. Many Christians, for example, consider marriage a sacrament and 
almost all agree that marriage is  instituted by God and serves as a figure of Christ and 
the Church. Pope John Paul II said there was no possibility the church would redefine 
its view of matrimony <R> He considers that marriage is a holy union 
between a man and a woman <Q> <R>. Moreover, in a document, written by the Vatican, it is said that: <Q> <R>. However, it could 
be argued that our constitution establishes the principle of separation of church and 
state. This principle, applies to marriage too. It should not be forgotten that marriage 
may be considered a legal contract. And it is the legal dimension that is being debated. 
Granting marriage rights to same-sex couples would not require Christianity, Judaism, 
Islam or any other religion to perform them. It would not require religious institutions to 
permit these ceremonies to be held on their grounds. People of faith would remain free 
to make their own judgements about what makes a marriage in the eyes of God, just as 
they are today. 

There are other people, with a non-religious perspective, that may feel that homosexual 
marriage goes against nature. This, is a premise which influences other arguments and 
which lies behind many people's negative opinions about homosexuality in general. For 
most people, heterosexual relationships are the norm, both in society and in nature. 
Homosexual marriage are therefore, considered abnormal and unnatural. They argue 
that, if we take a close look to it, we will not be able to see any example of same-sex 
couples within any species of living beings. Therefore, homosexual matrimonies should 
not be validated by society because we do not find them in nature. Nevertheless, it could 
be said that those arguments, may try to take advantage of the neutral categories of 
"natural" and "unnatural" in support of one's position, which actually seems to be just a 
matter of definition. In addition, humans, are part of nature, so if humans have 
homosexual relationships, that may be also part of nature.  It also appears that those that 
defend those arguments, use them as masks for religious, political or social prejudices.

The argument that homosexual relationships are "unnatural" is also meant to describe 
the fact that those marriages cannot procreate, which is supposed to be the "natural" 
consequence of such relationships. It is argued that gay marriage would undermine the 
institution of marriage because it is a legal and moral institution designed to promote 
and protect procreation and the raising of children. But according to this, no infertile 
couples would be allowed to marry; this would include both younger people who are 
infertile due to health issues as well as older people who are infertile due to the progress 
of old age. In addition to this, <Q> <R>. The differences are insignificant. Psychologists 
tell us that what makes the difference is the <Q>. Gay people are as capable of loving children as fully as anyone else. So, 
it could be argued that those opinions about the unnaturality of homosexual marriages 
cannot be accepted: just because some activity is not the norm among humans does not 
mean that it is unnatural and wrong. 

There are some people that accept marriage between people from the same sex but feel 
uncomfortable applying the term "matrimony" to those unions. For them, the word 
"marriage" is a term used by Christians to describe a sacred union between people of 
different sexes. They would not have any problem with what those legal unions would 
represent: equality of rights with the marriage couples, rights of inheritance, insurance, 
joint income tax filling, social services, fiscal advantages, etc. <R>. But 
they would not use the term "Gay Marriage", because:
 <Q>  <R>. This mid point of 
view, technically could be seen as a fair solution to the problem, avoiding those 
religious connotations that could affect some sectors of society. However, in practice, 
probably the term matrimony may still be used because of convention. 

The main arguments in favour of homosexual marriages are held by the gay and lesbian 
community itself and by some heterosexual people who feel that those groups deserve 
exactly the same rights straight-couples have. Many same-sex couples want the right to 
legally marry because they are in love and they want to honour their relationship in one 
of the greatest ways our society has to offer, by making a public commitment to stand 
together in good and bad times. They also recognize that it is simply, not fair to deny 
some families the protections all other families are to enjoy. The values that such gay 
couples exhibit in their daily lives are often indistinguishable from those of their 
straight neighbours. They are loyal to their mates, are monogamous, and devoted 
partners. They value and participate in family life, are committed to making their 
neighbourhoods and communities safer and better places to live. Many make valuable 
contributions to their communities, serving on school boards, volunteering in 
community charities, and trying to be good citizens. In doing so, they take full 
advantage of their relationship to make not only their own lives better, but those of their 
neighbours as well. These arguments are not based on any kind of discrimination 
towards any social group and, therefore they could be considered quite convincing. 

In conclusion, there are many arguments concerning the issue of letting gay couples 
marry. Those against these unions argue that marriage is an institution between man and 
women; therefore, it is unnatural and immoral to accept these matrimonies. In addition, 
they do believe that same-sex couples cannot marry since they are not able to have 
children, which, according to those groups, is the final goal of marriages. On the other 
hand there are some people, that consider gay couples should have exactly the same 
right to marry as straight-couples have, since marriage is a way of expressing each other 
the love they feel. Considering all the points of view already mentioned, it might be a 
good step towards equality the fact that society gets over its  fears and prejudices based 
mainly on ignorance and becomes a more open-minded one.
