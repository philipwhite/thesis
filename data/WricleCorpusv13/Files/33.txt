The institution of marriage has been in a state of constant change for centuries. In the   United States, it was only after the civil war that African-Americans were allowed to   marry; and it was not until 1967 that a decision from the U.S Supreme Court allowed   mixed race couples to marry. Until recently, same-sex couples could not marry   anywhere in the world. In April 2001 Holland was the first country to legalize   homosexual marriages by expanding its definition of marriage to include, apart from   opposite-sex couples, same-sex couples. Ever since, this issue has been one of constant   debate in western societies. In this essay, I will try to give different points of view   regarding the right homosexuals have to get married and I will also discuss whether or   not they should have the right to adopt children.      From the point of view of those who stand in opposition, homosexuals do not have the   right to marry because, though marriage is a right, it is a natural right based on the   biological need to procreate. Therefore, the definition of marriage should be restricted to   the union of a man and a woman. These heterosexual marriages are, from this point of   view, considered essential as a means of procreation and in order to lay the foundations   of the family unit and of civilization. It is also argued that homosexual relationships   can by no natural or biological means lead to reproduction, that is, that they are sterile   by definition. From this point of view, marriage is seen as the social codification of an   evolved long term mating strategy, with economic and legal benefits to facilitate family   growth and stability.       One of the most powerful arguments against homosexual marriages is that marriage is   traditionally between persons of opposite sex. Therefore, the opposite sex of the   partners is a fundamental attribute of marriage and same-sex couples can not get   married. This leads to another argument, that whatever sort of union same-sex couples   are joined in, it is not marriage. It has been argued that same-sex couples should be   given the right to join in some kind of union, and several names have been proposed   such as "civil union", "same-sex union" or, even, "same-sex marriage". This would help   to create a new kind of relationship with it's own regulation, a specifically same-sex   relationship, but different from marriage.          One of the main arguments that are usually put forward to defend homosexual   marriages is that, since homosexuals are treated by the law in the same way as   heterosexuals when it comes to obligations, they should also be treated in the same   way when it comes to rights. This is one of the main reasons for which homosexual   couples lay so much emphasis on being included in the definition of marriage and don't   just conform with having a special kind of union reserved for partners of the same sex.   Homosexuals that want to marry each other want to have a real marriage. The advocates   of homosexual marriages would argue that it's not about the actual ceremony itself but   about the legal and financial protections and benefits that are given to married couples.   These benefits range from tax relief to medical decision making on behalf of the   partner. So it is argued that by receiving these same benefits, homosexual couples   would be provided with a strengthened relationship and a stable family structure.       The religious point of view should also be taken into account. The Church teaches that   respect for homosexual persons cannot lead in any way to approval of homosexual   behaviour or to legal recognition of homosexual unions. The common good requires   that laws recognize, promote and protect marriage as the basis of the family, the primary   unit of society. Legal recognition of homosexual unions or placing them on the same   level as marriage would mean not only the approval of deviant behaviour, with the   consequence of making it a model in present-day society, but would also obscure basic   values which belong to the common inheritance of humanity. The Church cannot fail to   defend these values, for the good of men and women and for the good of society itself.       Nevertheless, there are also important arguments in favour of gay marriages. Let's   look at some of them. Those that argue in favour usually wonder why should one set of   loving, consenting adults be denied a right that other such adults have and which, if   exercised, would do no damage to anyone else. From this point of view, the question   about the real nature of marriage immediately arises. People in favour of homosexual   marriage would answer that marriage is a binding commitment, at once legal, social and   personal, between two people to take on special obligations to one another. Therefore, if   homosexuals want to make such marital commitments to one another, and to society,   then they should not be prevented from doing so.         Now, we have seen some points of view regarding this issue but there is something   else that we should take into account and that is whether same-sex couples should have,   in case of getting married, the right to child adoption. This certainly doesn't seem to be   a minor issue because, in some cases, it is precisely this what inclines people to the   acceptance or not of homosexual marriages. Let's take a look at some points of view   regarding child adoption by same-sex couples.      First, we should consider the different arguments concerning gender roles. Some   opponents of adoption by same-sex couples question whether these couples would be   able to provide children with adequate gender roles. The underlying sentiment is that,   without both male and female role models, children may develop in such a way that   they might be unable to fulfill traditional gender roles in future heterosexual   relationships. The argument that same-sex parents are unsuitable hinges on the   assumption that children of single parent households suffer due to a lack of gender role   models, whereas those in favour of child adoption by same-sex couples argue that the   cause for this may instead be a lack of parental care and supervision associated with   single parent households. Therefore, children would be better growing up with a   homosexual couple than in a single parent household.          Secondly, we should also take a look at some of the arguments relating to children's   sexual orientation. The debate here basically has to do with whether or not children that   have been raised by homosexual couples are more likely themselves to be homosexual   as adults. Evidence from studies suggests that it is a mixture of biological and   environmental factors what determines sexual orientation, although there is currently no   scientific consensus on what specific environmental factors contribute to determine   this. A number of studies comparing children raised by two mothers and those raised by   a mother and a father have not found any relation between same-sex parenting and a   greater likelihood of being later on in life gay or lesbian.       Finally, let's look at some arguments concerning parent's fitness for the adoption of   children. There is a substantial amount of studies that support the conclusion that, under   similar socioeconomic conditions, children raised by same-sex couples are comparable   to those raised by opposite-sex couples in terms of their mental and physical health. But    those who oppose to adoption by same-sex couples argue that gays and lesbians are   more prone to mental disorders than are heterosexual persons, that same-sex couples are   more likely to expose a child to negative influences and, therefore, such children are   more likely to suffer development problems.This leads them to conclude that    households of married heterosexual couples provide the most stable environment for   children, and that same-sex couples should not be permitted to adopt children.  Nevertheless, those favourable to gay adoption would reply that this argument is based   on a generalization and does not necessarily apply to individual same-sex couples; and   that extensive evaluations of individual prospective parents are a standard prerequisite   for adopting children, regardless of the prospective parents' gender and/or sexual   orientation.       To sum up, we have seen some arguments against same-sex couples getting married   such as the one that sees marriage as a natural right for the sake of procreation, or the   one that establishes marriage as a traditional union between persons of opposite sexes.   We have also seen the religious view of this issue which, although it respects   homosexuality, doesn't approve their behaviour nor their getting married. We have   also seen arguments in favour of gay marriages, such as the equality of rights. Finally,   we have analised several arguments both in favour and against the right to adopt children by same-sex couples, arguments concerning gender roles, children's sexual identity and whether homosexual couples are fit or not to adopt children. To conclude with, I have tried to give an overall view of this issue which, it seems, will still for some time give rise to a strong debate.     

   Ever since the first human communities were founded, several rules were created   in order to regulate people's coexistence and to prevent certain conducts that were   considered as anti-social. Thus, the law was born. But, with the law or even before it,   crime was also born. The struggle between law and crime has always been present in   our societies and, as the law became stronger, crime became more sophisticated, up to   the point when criminals began to organize themselves. By this, what is known as   organized crime was born. In this essay, I will analyze the role that organized crime   plays in society. I will give my personal opinion about this issue and give different   points of view on whether it is possible or not to erase it from our societies.      First of all, I would like to begin by explaining what is organized crime. Organized   crime, or what is more popularly known as "mafia", is crime carried out systematically   by formal criminal organizations. The FBI defines organized crime as any group having   some manner of a formalized structure and whose primary objective is to obtain money   through illegal activities. Such groups maintain their position through the use of actual   or threatened violence, corrupt public officials, graft or extortion, and generally have a   significant impact on the people in their locales, region, or the country as a whole.         One of the basic characteristics of organized crime is that it submerges itself in the   society, spreading its tentacles both through the low and the high levels of society. The   main reason for this "immersion" is that, if the organization wants to survive and   prosper, it needs some kind of support from the society in which it develops its   activities. For instance, if an organization wants to gain the support of, let's say, the   bakery trade of a certain neighbourhood or city, it would, for a small consideration,   offer them their protection against common criminals such as muggers or burglars. But   it would also use other methods such as blackmail, bribery and any form of corruption   in order to gain the favour of higher or more relevant social members, like policemen,   lawyers, judges and politicians.     This is one of the reasons for which, in my opinion, organized crime plays a quite   significant role in the society, and I would like to explain this with an example. The   mafia clans usually work as bankers for the community in which they operate; but,   contrary to banks, when someone is unable to pay them back, they don't take possession   of the debtor's properties. If the debtor is a shopkeeper, the mafia doesn't seize his   shop. They allow him to go on with his business, only that the mafia becomes the   owner, and the debtor becomes an employee of the organization and receives a salary.      Another important characteristic of organized crime is that it's not visible, that it's   disguised with a layer of legality. Thus, many criminal organizations have substantial   legitimate businesses, such as licensed gambling, building construction, or dock loading   enterprises, which operate in parallel with and provide cover for drug trafficking, money   laundering or prostitution among many other possible criminal activities. I would like to   argue that, from my point of view, this is a very important characteristic because it   allows the criminal organization to develop its activities under the complete   unawareness of the rest of the society. According to Lucchini, <Q> .      This is only an example of a phenomenon of which, it seems to me, we are not very   aware. In my opinion, when we discuss issues such as corruption in the urban   development, we only see the surface of the problem and we tend to blame politicians   for being corrupt. I think that, if we looked deeper into the problem, we would realize   that the real cause is the presence of organized crime.      So far, we have seen the definition of organized crime and we have seen some of its   basic and most important characteristics. Now I would like to analyze some possible   solutions against this type of crime. In my opinion, one of the keys in fighting organized   crime is seeing crime from the perspective of a structured and well organized activity,    not just focusing on crimes as single events committed by independent individuals. This   is the basic principle in the strategy followed by the FBI's Organized Crime Program.   The FBI has found that even if key individuals in an organization are removed, the   depth and financial strength of the organization often allows the enterprise to continue;   therefore, the FBI targets the entire organization responsible for a variety of criminal   activities.        One attitude that seems to be quite efficient against organized crime is to drain its   income from illegal activities. This is the key fight which the Czech Republic has   employed in its security policy since 1999, with the creation of specialized groups to   work on this. Confiscating illegally obtained financial means has proved an effective   method of tackling organized criminal groups, forfeiting the results of their actions and   also the financial means to continue their criminal activities. To me, it makes sense that   this measure turned out to be effective because, in my opinion, what these criminals   really care about is having their possessions confiscated and not so much about being   deprived of their freedom, that is being put into jail, because they seem to be able to go   on controlling the organization from inside the prison.      Finally, I would like to say that, in my opinion, these solutions seem quite appropriate   in the fight against organized crime, but we should not only apply police measures. I   believe that there is also a social component in the origin of organized crime. The   depressed areas or neighbourhoods of cities such as Naples, Moscow or New York, to   put some examples, seem to be a pool of new members for the criminal organizations,   due to the poverty in which its inhabitants live. In my opinion, we should put more   efforts on social policies, such as fighting unemployment in these depressed areas, so   that these people would not see the enrolment in a criminal organization as a way of   escaping poverty.      To sum up, we have seen a couple of definitions of organized crime. We have seen   that organized crime submerges itself in the society, corrupting and controlling different   members of it, and that it develops a number of illegal activities under the disguise of   other legal ones. We have seen some measures that are being used to fight organized   crime, the strategy of the FBI of attacking the organization as a whole, and the measure   of confiscating the organization's incomes and possessions that is used by the Czech   Republic. Finally, we have seen that this type of crime has also a social component and   that there should also be social measures applied in fighting it.
