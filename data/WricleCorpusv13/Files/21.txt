

Europe is said to have the highest per-capita consumption of cigarettes in the six World 
Health Organization regions, and the European Community is the second largest 
producer of cigarettes after China <R>, so the fact that in the 
European union alone smoking-related illness causes 500.000 deaths per year - 10% of 
them among non-smokers killed by second hand smoke <R> - is not 
surprising, but it should be alarming. Tobacco smoke contains more than 4.000 
chemical substances of which more than 50 are known to be carcinogenic and more than 
100 to be toxic; some of these more concentrated in second hand smoke <R>. To both protect the health of those who smoke and those who do not, 
Europe has passed some laws to restrict public smoking, but will we ever be able to get 
through the thick fog of European smoke and reach a clean air atmosphere?  In this 
essay I will discuss and personally analyse the opinions of Europeans towards the new 
antismoking laws.

It is assumed that smokers are likely to suffer from some specific illness caused by 
tobacco, what it is not so often regarded are the consequences of passive smoking: only 
15% of smoke from a cigarette is inhaled by the smoker, the remainder can be breathed 
in by the other people present <R>. According to the authors of a 
study published in April 2004 in the British Medical Journal there is a 15% higher risk 
of mortality in adults who live with a smoker <R>. In May of the same year, the 
WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified passive smoking in the 
group of human carcinogens and showed that involuntary exposure caused lung cancer 
in people who had never smoked <R>. Furthermore, tobacco smoke 
particularly affects children in whom it causes an increased risk of respiratory and ear 
infections among others. It was estimated that in 2001 within the EU-15 alone, exposure 
to second hand smoke accounted for 50 to 100.000 deaths each year <R>. 

France's pro-smoking culture is far from unique. During the ten years that the French 
have been ignoring their public smoking law, not a single fine or citation has been 
issued <R>. In France, asking someone to douse their cigarette is 
considered bad form, even an act of aggression. 
Catherine Pinet is the ex-smoker co-owner of "Le Chien qui fume" (the smoking dog), a 
Parisian caf�. <Q> <R>.
Sophie Duhamel, a travel agent, smoking at Poissy-Charles de Gaulle airport said: <Q> <R>.

Italy passed its first laws banning smoking in public places in 1975, but neither those 
laws nor the new ones seem to have been very effective... <Q> laments Angelo Pisani, a Naples lawyer who 
has filled a class action against tobacco companies (Crumley, 2003).
<Q> <R>.
Pino Mannarino, owner of Osteria dell'ingegno in Rome said that he did not think 
smoking regulations that are to take effect on January 1st 2006 will affect his 
restaurant's business much. <Q> <R>. 

In Britain, where there are no legal restrictions on smoking in public places, a recent 
survey found that 80% of people said that they favoured a smoking ban in the 
workplace, though that number dropped to 50% for a ban that included pubs <R>. The more than one quarter of Britons who smoke enjoy fairly broad freedom to 
inhale their fags in pubs and restaurants <R>. A patron at the London's 
oldest restaurants asks a waiter to stop the smokers at the next table, and the waiter 
chides him: <Q> <R>. 
Some British tourists in Dublin were rapturous about he pub air: <Q> <R>. 
Ian Murray of Dataflow Communications said: <Q> <R>.  

Ireland passed by far the strictest smoking ban in Europe on March 29 of 2004. it 
prohibits smoking in workplaces, which includes buses, offices, and pubs. Pub owners 
complain that business is down drastically, by as much as 50 per cent, and almost all 
say that they have had to lay off workers. In dozens of interviews, including many 
smokers, customers say that they are enjoying the clean air at the pub and the office. 
Many smokers admit that going outside for a cigarette is <Q>; what is more, 
almost all said that they had been smoking much less since the ban took effect. 

Spain is the second biggest per capita consumer of tobacco in Europe after Greece, 
according to market researchers Euromonitor. From January 1st of 2006 it is illegal to 
smoke in offices, most hospitals, schools and shopping centers, while bars and 
restaurants of more than 100 square meters must have non-smoking sections, but bars 
smaller than that can choose whether to ban or allow smoking throughout. More than 
half of Spain considers smoking a right that should not be restricted, according to a 
recent survey by government pollsters CIS. <Q> <R>. 
According to Jos� Luis Guerra, spokesman for the Spanish Hoteliers Federation 
(FEHR), <Q> <R>. 

In 2001 the Russian government passed a host of  laws that barred smoking in offices 
and on public transportation and prohibited the sale of tobacco to people under 18. The 
Russian law also proscribes depiction of smoking in TV, film and theatre productions, 
and 400.000 people die from tobacco-related diseases each year <R>. 

Upscale restaurants in Lisbon provide smokers with covers for cigarette packs so they 
will not have those hostile health warnings disturbing their meal <R>.

In Denmark, there is no minimum age for purchasing tobacco, so 10 year-olds are free 
to light up just about anywhere except for the classroom <R>.

According to this opinions, we can get to the conclusion that the majority of the 
Europeans - 'casually' most of them smokers - do not seem to be very happy with the 
new antismoking laws, because they are being quitted of what they consider a right, and 
they feel like victims of the law. This seems to me a rather selfish opinion: if talking 
about rights, what are the right for the non-smokers then? For many years, non-smokers 
have suffered the smoke of tobacco almost everywhere, and they respected those who 
smoked. Now that the tides have turned, respect has just disappeared because most 
smokers infringe the laws and do what they like, they just regard their own world of 
unfairness and misunderstood excluding non-smokers al all, who in my opinion, are the 
real victims of smoke. Personally I do not have any problem with someone who wants 
to kill himself by smoking, what I do not accept is that I also have to be affected by that 
person's addiction, and I think that many other non-smokers have this opinion. 
I believe that smoking is al big matter of respect. And when someone smokes, for 
example, inside the university, he is being disrespectful towards the ones who now have 
the right to breath clean air.

From my point of view there is also a lot of hypocrisy among many smokers. We can 
see this, for example, when a smoking mother tells his children to throw the envelope of 
their chewing-gums into the bin, and ten minutes later she throws her cigarette to the 
ground and steps over it. Why is one breakable and not the other? They are both ways 
of breaking a law, should not they be considered the same? How can you hope to be 
respected when you do not respect the rights of the others?

Some smokers say that smoking is a part of their culture, they have always acted like 
that and so they will go on smoking. Smoking is considered a tradition all over Europe. 
Cutting the hand of someone who stole in a market was also a tradition three or four 
centuries ago, but traditions change because we must progress, so ,for me, the fact that 
smoking is regarded as 'traditional' is not a strong enough excuse for breaking the new 
antismoking laws. 

I think that the biggest problem on this issue is not only that we feel that our rights are 
being hurt, but that breaking the antismoke laws does affect our health and so our lives 
very negatively. I believe that the fact that a child or an adult who has never smoked 
may die from a lung cancer because of passive-smoking is so unfair... Smokers have 
the right to do what they want with their health, but non-smokers have the right not to 
be condemned to bad health condition or even death because of tobacco.
From my viewpoint, the matter would come to an end if we just respected the rights of 
the others.  






















Domestic violence and child abuse are not new social problems nor have they recently 
appeared, but on the contrary, they are both considered an accepted part of our culture, 
unfortunately. Over the course of human history thousands of children, as well as 
women, have suffered physically, psychologically and sexually as a result of acts of 
violence against them. However, it seems to be that in the last decades our society has 
witnessed a huge and alarming increase of domestic violence and new cases of child 
abuse appear everyday on TV. Incredibly, many judges claim that those who committed 
these `crimes' (as they must be considered such a thing) can not be found guilty, 
arguing excuses such as mental illness. Yet, I personally believe that such people should 
be judge just as any other criminal and I will even go so far as to show they can be even 
worse, since their actions produce in most cases permanent physical and mentally 
traumas to the victims.The strongest  argument that supports my viewpoint  deals with 
the fact that these abuses and acts of violence  have lots of repercussions for the victims. 
Indeed, child abuse has devastating consequences, affecting every aspect of a child's 
life: psychologically, physical, behavioural, academic, sexual, interpersonal, self-
perceptualand even spiritually. In some cases, the consequences are fatal <R>. At the same level, domestic violence may affect their social-
cognitive development competence. These facts reinforce my viewpoint about the duty 
of the judges to try those perpetrators of violence and abuses just the same way a 
murderer or a terrorist would be judged. However, there still lot of people who believe 
that these cases are a bit more complex than just what we hear about them on TV, and 
ask for understanding for the batterer or the abuser. They argue that a high incidence of 
violent men and their victims ( women) have been raised in violent homes and 
witnessed domestic violence as children <R>. Many people 
believe that growing up in a violent family increases the likelihood of becoming an 
abused wife, in the case of women, while men are more likely to be violent in their 
adolescent and adult relationships. Some researches point out that ongoing conflict 
between parents as children has a profound influence on adolescent development and 
future adult behaviour, and can be the strongest predictor of violent delinquency. These 
children tend to believe that violence is an appropriate way of resolving conflict in 
human relationships. Nevertheless, it is emphasised that not all children who lived with 
abusive relationships will repeat the experience <R>.   In 
fact, they are the ones who should know better than anybody else how awful, unfair and 
traumatic these abuses and acts of violence towards others can be. It appears to me that 
there should not be an excuse for these abuses, since there are as well many other 
people than have suffered for years the same abuses and the same violence and far from 
these batterers, they have set their life towards supporting others who are suffering now 
as they did before. I strongly believe it shouldn't be used as a reason to excuse such 
terrible acts, but on the contrary it should reinforce their guilt as they are making others 
suffer the same way they did.Another of the arguments that supports my point of view, 
concerns with the grade of importance that mistreatment and abuses are given in 
relation with other types of crimes, such as illegal prostitution, robbery and assault, pick 
pocketing, piracy and other 'crimes` which, in my opinion, are not as relevant as those 
which imply abuses and violence, specially towards children. I personally believe, 
violence and abuses can not be considered at the same level as a crime which many 
times is based on a need, whether due to lack of money, of a permanent job or lack of 
food (even tough I don't mean to say  that ALL people who steal or commit piracy do it 
pushed by a need). I think those crimes are irrelevant if we consider the fact that abuse 
and domestic violence implies physical and psychological damage while illegal 
prostitution or piracy do not. Indeed, the purpose of stealing and prostitution is far from 
damaging anybody while domestic violence is based exactly in that purpose. Moreover, 
our laws seem to care much more about the know as 'top manta` and about cleaning our 
streets from prostitutes, who are just trying to earn enough to live on, than about 
mistreated wives and abused children. In fact, it wasn't until few years ago that our 
society became aware of the magnitude of this problem. On the other hand, it is also 
true that, according to several researches, violence victims do not usually report the 
husband to the authorities for child abuse, due probably to reasons of fear of reprisals to 
counter charges by the husband. As a consequence of this, health and welfare 
professionals feel the frustration of not being able to intervene legally to protect child 
witnesses from extreme incidents of domestic violence unless there was also evidence 
of child abuse. That is, many incidents could be avoid if the victims reported such 
abuses to authorities.However, it still being a shame that Law should not get involved in 
these cases until a murder has taken place, as it happens in our country. When a murder 
takes place as a result of years of enduring mistreatment, or we suddenly hear a case of 
child abuse by a member of the family or a neighbour, there's people who start 
speculating on the possibility of a mental illness.  In many cases, the judge can not try 
the accused because he argues illness. In my opinion, these batterers and abusers do 
exactly know what they are doing when committing these crimes. There is no single, 
definitive cause or reason for child abuse, but the perpetrators know perfectly that any 
child may be vulnerable to being abused. Many experts believe that child abuse is 
linked to inequalities among people in our society and the power imbalance between 
adults and children. A child is usually in a position of dependence on his or her abuser, 
and has little or no power compared to the abuser <R>.  
The batterer or abuser is concerned about this fact and about the child's vulnerability to 
abuse and takes advantage of it. Indeed, many children sent in the past to institutions 
experienced abuse as well as physical violence. Arguing illness is not enough to make 
the victims forget about all they have passed through during the time these abuses have 
been taking place. Once more, we have to bear in mind all the physical and 
psychological disorders that can de produced by these acts.I strongly believe there is no 
convincing nor possible excuse from my point of view, to forgive a damage caused by 
someone to an innocent and vulnerable being as a child is. Even tough he/her might be 
mentally ill, the damage would already be done.  As a conclusion, what I tried to do 
with this essay, is to show just some of the countless damages and disorders domestic 
violence and abuse can produce to a human being, specially to children, and the 
injustice of our Law concerning these crimes, in order to prove that batterers and 
abusers are not being treated as they should:  as real criminals who can destroy by these 
acts of violence their victim's life. I strongly agree with the idea of imposing stronger 
penalties to these people, apart from the assumption  that they might be mentally ill or 
not. I have no doubt about their consciousness of their acts and I personally believe the 
victims would support a trial where their abusers would be judge as any other criminal.
