									                                                           Nowadays, it has been noticed that  the school violence is increasing, this is a serious problem that has not  received much attention until late, what worries the government. Spain occupies one of the first positions of the E.U. in relation with the school  violence, and several surveys recently made show that 75% of the  publicized violence in recent history has occurred in public schools,   another data is that 53% of the kids bring guns, knives or other weapons to    school . In this essay, I will try to determine the causes that in my view   are the responsables for the increasing of school violence and I will  propose some solutions that I feel could be useful to finish or at least   reduce this problem.  I strongly believe that one possible  cause of this problem is the easy access young people have to guns, knives  or other weapons makes easy its increase. It is a fact that the selling of   guns to people under 18 years old ( it depends on the region ) is forbidden,  but however they can get it from guns sellers without any problem or  obstacle,  nothing else than a written warning. However it could be argued  that the owners or employees of the establishment where the seller is,  have the obligation to prevent children from using them. But, the   experience shows that at many places it is not done either because the  benefit a selling represents , or because it is thought that the children will    get guns anyway, so it is not worth to make difficult this act.                                                             I think that another possible cause is  that the violent children often come from homes where there is little  warmth and parental attention, and where parents discipline inconsistently   using physical punishment and emotional outbursts. I think that one of the   most important influences are the ones we receive at home and the habits   or customs we are familiarized with, so I believe that if people is used to   be violent , they will consider it as something absolutely normal. However, it   could be said that the majority of teenagers who start in violence assaults  are led by other causes not for the parental attention. But, I think the   parental attention can make the children turn violent, and they have  been implicated in violent assaults at schools.                                                                                                                         I feel that is the attraction and the curiosity people normally feel for thing forbidden and unknown is an important cause to take into account. It is a fact that people , and over all children and teenagers, tend to feel those sensations to things they have   been said not to try or to do , and the reason is the nerves it provokes.  However, there are those who affirm that trying a "forbidden" product does not mean a future and constant increasing of school violence. But, I think that together with this curiosity and attraction goes the fact that youngers feel superior to those who said them not to be violent, and it is a  way to feel out of control and free from that people; I think it is a mixture  between curiosity, attraction and rebelliousness.  From my point of view, one of the most important causes is that some kids are copying behavior they have seen in video games, movies or television shows. In Spain, some children think that the violence or the aggression is an effective strategy to secure power and solve social problems. However, it could be said that not all children will be  similarly influenced by images of power and aggression. Anyway, I think the   violence and the action influence the kids when they are watching the   television. I think that another possible cause is  the racism. Racism is present in schools such as direct racism can be seen in incidents of racist abuse, harassment and discrimination, and racism is also manifested indirectly , in the form of prejudiced attitudes , lack of   recognition of cultural diversity and culturally biased practices. It is a fact that violent social groups such as Latin King's , Ñetas ,Skinheads provokes violent incidents in schools which are associated with racist behaviour. Howevwer, it could be said, that the majority of these violent social groups  at school practically no produce violent assaults. Anyway, I think that the  danger of these violent social groups can turn schools in a climate very   depressed, and I feel that the students who experience racism have   reduced their levels of self-confidence and their feelings of insecurity   tend to increase.                                                            Personally speaking, I feel , that something that could help to diminish this serious problem could be the government create a censure that can eliminate violent video games , music, and movies. The violence and the action are understood by all in a global market, films chock a block with action and violence are easier to sell abroad  because they translate with less difficulty and jump over cultural barriers. It could be said that not all children will be similarly influenced by images of power and aggression and this strict measure would harm adult people in relation with the comfort they have when watching an action movie with their families. However, I feel that the government could reduce the school violence with this simple measure and this can be the beginning for a well- educated to our children.  I personally believe that could be useful to create rehabilitation programs for students who have been implicated in violent assaults at schools,or the government promotes specific program and strategy selections based on a thorough assessment of each school needs and the involvement of all teachers , parents and students. These programs can be implemented in combinations to form a  comprehensive approach to the prevention of violence , and more generally , the promotion of school safety. But it could be said that these programs are very strong and could provoke depression or a future psychological  trauma. However, I think the positive effects of these programs could be more beneficial than those indesirable effects ; these programs can be useful to reduce theft , bullying and sexual harassment.  Another possible solution could be useful   to install security measures in the schools such as metal detectors, surveillance cameras , X - ray machines , this could be useful to reduce this   problem. The government had to promote different measures against  the   increasing of the school violence , although it is done , I feel, in a soft and  weak way , so the government should streng then school safety with these   security measures. However , it could be argued that these security   measures are  expensive and turn schools into prisions, and some parents   can find these security measures coercive and demanding. Anyway, I think   the government  should look after the school safety instead of economical   benefits ; although most school violence takes the form of minor assaults ,  some episodes are far more serious, some end in tragedy; and furthermore   it has to be taken into account that the indemnifications will be very   expensive.  I feel that one solution that could be useful to finish or at least reduce this problem could be that the government creates a law against the selling of guns to people under 21 years old, and also the government should strenghtren the penalities for those establishments where exist a nonfulfillment of the law. I feel, the young people could have more difficulties for obtain a gun . However, it could be said that the establishments lost a big sum of money, and that the young people that have the hobby of be hunter with this law cannot practise this sport. However, with this measure , I feel that the government could reduce the easy access young people have to guns, knives or other weapons.                                                           To conclude, in this essay I have shown some of the causes that in my view could be increasing the school violence.  Those are the great effect video games, movies, television shows have on children and teenagers; the easy access to guns, knives or other weapons; the curiosity and the attraction people tend to feel to unknown and forbidden things; the violent children often come from homes where there is little warmth and parental attention and where parents discipline using  physical punishment and racism. I have also proposed some solutions that I feel could diminish the problem, such as the government should install security measures in schools  such as metal detectors; the government could create a censure that can eliminate violent video games, movies; to create rehabilitation programs for students who have been implicated in violent assaults at schools or that the government promotes specific program and strategy selections based on a thorough assessment of each school needs and the involvement of all teachers, parents; create a law against the selling of guns to people under 21 years old and also strenghtren the penalities for those establishments where exist a nonfulfillment of the law. I would like to add as a personal comment that as this is a serious problem that concerns both the citizens themselves and the government of the country should make use of every measure or act that could help to reduce, although it is only a little, the magnitude this trouble represents.
