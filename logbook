Renamed parser.clj to parse.clj along with package thesis.parse. This packages now contains a function parse-sentences that takes a list of preprocessed text and returns only the parses that are complete sentences. Also added functions in data.clj that return the preprocessed text. Next step is to write a function that will create dependences for these parses. Then use those dependencies as features for WEKA.

Finished a preliminary preprocessor for the micusp resource. regexes need improvement as some documents seem to be cutoff. Also there is some initial information that needs to be striped.

Have been working on a preprocessor for the micusp resource. Still in progress. There are slight differences between the files in terms of the page headers that need to be stripped; mainly a difference of newlines but possibly more. New folder code-nu containing code that does batch converts from PDFs to utf8.

Initial entry. Up to this point, I have been
working in Clojure with the Stanford Parser (1.6.4 and now
1.6.7). Using the factored and PCFG parser I have generated
parse-trees and Stanford dependencies.
Yesterday spoke to Drs. Biava
and Smith regarding this project. Basically just explained my
intentions. Talked about finding corpora, the surprising paucity of
Spanish linguistics literature, etc.

I should provide a basic overview of my goals here:
Using parse trees, Stanford Dependencies, possibilty vocabulary, and a
machine learning package (likely WEKA) I want to create a system that
will look at an English text and attempt to determine if it was
written by a Spanish L1 or native English speaker. The problem here if
finding the features in trees etc. that will allow this
classification.

Immediate Plans:
Setup a Git repository? Today I emailed Dr. Smith regarding university
server space for this.
Stanford dependencies consists of "approximately 52 grammatical
relations" (SD manual). Try using these as features for a first
attempt at a classifications system. In other words, for a text just
count the number of each relation it has and see if that gives the
classifier something to work with.
